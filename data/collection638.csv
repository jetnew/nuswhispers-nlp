I doubt if you’re in manufacturing so stop generalizing “engineering”. Either that or you’re calculating by 4k x 12 months + 1 month aws + 3 months bonus in order to get 5.5k.

You people are the reason why Singapore has more and more desktop engineers who knows nothing about hands on skills and think engineering is about excel spreadsheets, contributes nothing to the company technology roadmap while asking for high pay.

ps: saw some fresh grads with pt or overseas degree in the comments. Good luck to you if you think you are on par with local grads."
63895,"Hi everyone, esp those non-CS students taking a minor in CS. Isit advisable to clear the 5 CS modules within 1 AY to get the minor"
63894,"I’m curious. Are those who suffer from depression mentally weak? I’m mean life can get real harsh and it’s true that some may experience more hardships than another. Given the same predicament, a mentally strong person would’ve pulled through and pressed on, on the other hand the one who is mentally weak would’ve broken down and given in to depression. Is this how it works?"
63893,"The reason why cs is so toxic, making it harder to achieve a good gpa for an average student with no background in coding, is because unlike other courses where students are learning things with no prior knowledge (you dont just know about electrical engineering, philosophy, marketing or psychology since young) whereas some cs students have been doing these coding things since young (primary/ secondary school) and overtime their skills have just gotten better before entering uni. So the battleground is favoring these students as some mods are basically a revision to these students. 

So my fellow average cs joe, the suffering wont end. RIP GPA."
63892,"I’ve always thought that I’m an introverted person who loves staying in and is more than ok to just have a few friends to meet up for meals/chitchat once in a while and that’s about it. Until recently, I realised I may not be as introverted as I thought. My long term partner is currently working overseas for a few months and I realised how lonely I really was. 

I started to initiate more meet ups with my close friends and the not so close ones hoping to kill the boredom. I even went on to suggest overseas short trips together but most of them either do not have the budget or simply aren’t interested to go with me (I think). Despite loving being at home all the time, doing the chores, binge watch tonnes of drama series but too much of that makes my heart empty and aimless. Sounds contradictory I know. I do work but my job is kind of like freelancing so when I do not have jobs I’ve a lot of time on hand. 

I’ve thought of going out alone or even go on solo trips but I’m not too sure why going/doing anything outside alone seems too depressing for me. There’s a negative vibe whenever I’m alone outside. How to pluck up the courage to go on solo overseas trips? Anyone else feels the same? How to make yourself feel more enriched when you do stuff alone? Anyone who has the budget and wants to go on a short overseas trip too? P.s. I’m a super easy going person and I get along with most people."
63891,"Is it worth it to have children nowadays? I am comparing those people around my age group up till about 40 among those in my relatives and in the companies I have interned at. Comparing people of the same age, those who are single or married but childless seem to look much younger and energetic. Those who have children often look so tired and haggard and some already have obvious white hairs which is unexpected for people of that age. Their clothing also usually look outdated. Can anyone explain if this is the norm? Thinking of all those stresses and sacrifices in terms of time, sleep, money etc to look after children really scares me off.."
63889,"With so much hooha about what is the appropriate pay. This is my take on it. 

A lil background so everyone can know where I am coming from. 

I started working right after NS at an SME, with a pay of 1.8k while taking a part time degree at SIM GE, graduated with a GPA that will make most of you here cringe.  I am now working at a fortune 100 company with a starting pay of 5k++/mth. This is something almost impossible for a private graduate to get with only 1 yr of post degree experience. Prof Ben Leong, i think you will agree with me. 

Today(2 years) in the company i am getting close to 7k, and my application for sponsorship for my masters at NUS is pending approval. 

What I want to say is it is all about your attitude, I didn't expect to get 5k+ as I only asked for 2.8k. Sometimes asking for a reasonable pay will get you a pay higher than you expect. I do count my blessing not all private graduate do get what I have got. A friend of mine who graduated from SIM GE as well is on his 3rd year of working right now and his pay is no where near mine. As he don't show a good attitude. 

As one of my lecturer once told me ""Don't be a degree holder, be a graduate. Don't look for a job, a job will make you drag your feet to work everyday, look for a career and you will not have worries about pay"""
63885,"Hi ppl, I'm a year 2 going year 3 econs student. I've calculated according to my module planning that I would have 16 MCs left for UE. I would like to ask seniors or people of relevant expertise, should I:
1) take more core modules which I am interested in and would be relevant for future job, or
2) take UEs which are easy to score to potentially push up my CAP, or
3) use them to take a minor (I only need 3 more modules to complete the minor, out of which 1 is SU-able)

Would appreciate your help!"
63883,"I realized that I need 7 more MCs from Unrestricted Electives modules to graduate, and I'm hoping that I can find UEs modules that are not graded (CS/CU). It's my last year, and I pick a quite heavy set of modules in my major, so I don't really have time to prepare more. I've calculated the worst-case scenario, and my grade can be lower than the threshold of my expected class if I don't do well for these 7 MCs, so I don't really want to risk all of my hard work during the last 4 years for that. Advice is appreciated, thanks in advance."
63882,"The 30-year-old-still-single issue really haunts many of us CS students, especially those who went to the states. I graduated about 5 years ago and went to FAANG since graduation.

As always, we look for new opportunities, fancy projects and better compensation but we keep burying the deep down desire to actually get attached. Many of my friends here would avoid the topic or simply laugh about it instead of doing something about it. Year after year we just keep doing the same stuff or perhaps spice it up with side projects.

Personally, I have started to apply for jobs back in sg to get to meet potential partners. For those who question why not get a Caucasian wife, answer is that it is not that simple and I really want a Singaporean partner despite all the criticisms raised here.

Looking forward to constructive comments on how to break this cycle thank you!

P.s. most of us cs students are an example of high salary (100-300k) does not mean finding gf is easy. We still need to work hard for it!"
63881,"Can I ask what’s the difference between First Class Honours / Second Class (Upper) Honours etc and Honours (Highest Distinction) / Honours (Distinction) etc?
To my knowledge, the latter naming is the new, renamed version of the former so if that is so, why is everyone here still using the former naming instead of the latter? Is it because of habit?
Sorry for being ignorant but I was really confused when people here kept using the former naming and when I Googled it, I couldn’t really find much hahaha"
63880,The leaked results were just released and I realised my MA1521 calculus got merely a B+. I'm at a loss now since all my friends nearby were getting an A+. Does this mean that I will be facing hardship in the future? I'm really disappointed and lost all faith in myself now
63877,"From the leaked results, I found that I attained a D+ for a 2k mod with prereq. I really don't want a D+ on my grade and I want to go SEP (min req no grade below C), is it possible to ask to repeat the module?"
63876,"I am 30 and own a condo, intent was to collect rent. Met my gf the same time I collected my keys and she wanted to move in tgt. Is it only right that she affords half the rent? Gf is earning a decent income. She is extremely unhappy about this fact and would want to break up if she's asked to."
63875,"Hi guys!

May I check what’s the criteria for dean’s list? I just checked my results and I got 1A+,4As and 1B+. I’m thinking of using my SU on the B+ but I’m afraid that the SU will affect my eligibility of getting dean’s list.

Thank for your advice!"
63874,"Hi hi, i'm the OP that asked if anyone's interested in a NUSWhispers meet up ahaha~ ????

So.. I'll be organizing it on one of the Fridays in June. I'll PM the meet up details soon to all who commented your interest (not reacts ya). Anyway to answer the 2 questions..

Duh, you yourself. This ain't a sponsored meet up leh haha~ Though, don't worry.. I've chosen a wallet-friendly place. Even has free-flow.... Well, you'll find out if you attend keke.

2. What do we do during the meet up?
Well, it's a dinner.. So, we eat. Or if you're ready to step slightly out of your comfort zone, you can be sociable and talk to other NUSWhispers peeps. Or.. Is there any activity that you have in mind? O.o

Anyway, I'll PM within the next few days to all who commented on that previous and this current post. Cya guys soon!"
63873,"Even SMRT pays 3.8k for good honors. Their starting diploma pay is 2.4k. Good luck to employers offering 2.5k starting for fresh grads. They need a reality check.

63868,"Do your have any friends that is very sensitive and subjective? I tried to help her by giving feedback and suggestion to improve her art work. She will end up saying things like "" LOL I don't care"", ""forgot about it, too lazy to make the changes"", "" eww, this artist repost pic that I don't like. Mute and block her"", ""I no need any inspiration or references, I can practice myself"" 

When she posted her artwork online, she will complain how come so ugly, why no one like my arts, why no followers.. etc. 

I feel like I am wasting my time helping her.

If in your case, what will you do?"
63866,"#63851: PSA from graduating senior, in case you didn't know, standard interview format is leetcode-style questions (~CS2010 in my time), plus role/company-specific questions (db/networking/js etc), 

Interviewing is a muggable skill and imo more a gauge of focused effort than academic talent, so the lonely hours you put in training (by design) will be rewarded with offer letters. 

You have stats knowledge which is somewhat hot-for-now in ML, encourage you to explore there a bit if stats is your thing. As for internships, from experience CAP was not mentioned, just apply early, show you have the skills. Overseas may pay well if self-source, my 2nd year internship was not that helpful in growing my technical skill but it helps to have an awareness and intuition of different working environments, in terms of pay, culture, company direction, etc. Good luck, have fun!"
63865,"When I look for job requirements they always seem to ask something way higher than what I achieved (I’m in Psychology) such as a minimum 2nd upper, or strong desires in pursuing Masters/PhD, relevant experience/knowledge in the field etc. But I really have no confidence in fulfilling any of these criteria. I could not even get a thesis professor so if they do ask for a recent report I have, it’s literally my lab report or some module report which is so much easier (since I don’t really need to care about the experiments or results as much).

Granted these requirements are usually found for research positions, but I do have some interest in that (despite my below-expectation grades)

Does this mean I should work in places that accept a general degree (like HR I guess…) before working my way up? I actually have only started scouting for a job in the past few weeks despite having graduated for a while now"
63864,"To #63854, have you ever thought that maybe you got it above 4k but others around you were just falsely declaring theirs so as to not appear lousy compared to you? Seeing that how ppl can falsely claim their grades, it's not entirely impossible they did that. Guys, the days when you can get 4k are when there was no influx of foreigners maybe, these ppl spouting the 4k nonsense might not have even seen the reality of the number of foreigners around in the workforce or the number of Malaysians for that matter which highly likely makes their claim false."

63859,"I am nearing 30 and never have any luck with girls. All the girls I met in school or work or dating app are somehow not interested in me despite my best efforts. My longest relationship lasted barely a month. I have a 2nd upper degree and a stable job and income but the ladies don't buy into it. I never go for girls out of my league but even those average girls rejected me. One of my aims in life is to have children of my own. Now I am of this age, I am considering should I go for a foreign wife? I saw many agencies promising you can get a wife in a few months for a few thousand dollars. The biggest draw is that I don't need to go through the long period of dating hassle and uncertainty and gives me a family for that price."
63857,"My advice is to push for compensation to match the value you create for the company — not what the prevailing market rate is.

I have been interviewing at companies based in both Singapore and the US over the last two semesters. Anecdotally, the US pays much higher than in Singapore. In one occurrence, I received an offer of about 210k SGD a year for a role in the US office, whereas I was only offered about 90k SGD a year for the exact same role in the Singapore office (including CPF contribution). 

That is ridiculous.

Companies should not have the privilege to generate the same amount of money in both the US and Singapore, enjoy lower taxes in Singapore, and still pay their workers less just because that is the prevailing market rate.

As someone who has decided to leave the country, my message to people who choose to stay is this: 

Yes, be realistic about your expectations — don't ask for more than you provide — but if you're offered less than the value you bring to the table, it is your duty to push back against unfair compensation.

Think about the message you're sending if you don't push back."

63839,"Fate has a way of biting back at you. I did well at my A-levels, and entered accountancy, thinking it was a lucrative industry. I'd looked down at one of my best friends, who screwed up for his A-levels and then entered NIE to become a teacher - which was his last resort because he actually wanted to do the same thing as me. Throughout the years I felt sorry for him, but it was more because of my superior attitude rather than my sympathies for him.

Fast forward several years later... Now I'm slaving unhappily and bitterly as an auditor in a Big 4. The pay isn't what I expected and the working hours are long and harsh (fellow auditors will know). In comparison, my friend is hitting $5K a month, and with weekend tuition, he brings home an additional $1K. Yet we've been in the workforce for the same amount of time - 3 years. I envy him tremendously, and now as the June holidays arrive, he's going on a trip to Paris with his girlfriend. While I'm stuck here trying to clear my load. Haiz..."

My brother and I have no ill intentions. It’s just that my parents had us late and they are well into their late 60s now. We love them but we fear our relatives who covet the flat that we currently have because it was left to my parents by my grandparents (and some of my aunts & uncles were not too happy about that).

If she don't want to chat, why did she give me her number? And if she don't want to chat anymore, why don't she just block me? I'm totally confused.

My work is easy for a graduate to do and there is almost nothing that need thinking or brainstorming as everything is already planned and routine. The pay is pretty decent though not insane. Everyone is pretty laid back as well and there is very little pressure or politics.

I do count myself very lucky to be in such a job. But some people have told me that I should look for something more challenging as a young person, even with less pay. They said the mind will go rusty if we are in a Disneyland work environment all day and learn nothing and it is bad for my future career. Another group of people said I should really treasure this job as work life balance is so hard to find in singapore and less stress is the best for health. I can use the free time I have to pursue my hobbies, enjoy life and even start a 2nd side job to earn extra money. Which viewpoint should I take?"
63802,"Dear all local university graduates, when you are searching for a job, please ask for a realistic pay. 

Over the past week, I have interviewed some students who have ZERO working experience asking for pay of 7k and onwards.  When asked for their reason for wanting that pay, their reason? ""I graduated from a local university with first class honor"" 

Word of advice to all 
1. Please study the company properly before asking for sky high pay. Not all companies are Google, JP Morgan, Facebook that can give you sky high pay. 
2. Continuing from  point 1. find out who are you interviewing with and read up on his/her profile on LinkedIn etc. I have a handful of candidates whom are already informed that they are meeting the ""Regional Managing Director - APAC"" still tries to correct me on my company. 
3. Don't get all defensive and offended when the interviewer ask you ""Why do you think you deserve this pay"" etc.
4. Grades is nothing to the eyes of more and more companies, we are looking for the right person with the right attitude. Few years back, I hired a student from NUS who was nearly expelled twice and took 6 years to complete his degree. Today he is one of my managers with a team of 20 under him. 

With that, wishing all graduates good luck and all the best. Peace out"

63800,"I was a scrawny, average looking little kid back then in year 1 and was frequently rejected for being a creep by many of my crushes ( I actually lowered my standards and go for girls that are within my league). I then sought to improve myself by hitting the gym over the many months and have finally attained a hunky (in my books) body shape. Feels good now that I have managed to get the attention of the girls in school.

However, I have a dilemma. Should I increase my expectations for girls since my value has sort of increase? I know it sounds bad and judgy, but based on the posts and comments over here, it seems that I should go after girls from the higher leagues instead of those who looked damn average and looked down on me in the past."
