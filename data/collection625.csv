62598,"To #62576 about anxiety

I had it too. Actually at times there are still some symptoms here and there. I'm off medication already though. My advice would be to not just take medication but to look into psychotherapy or counselling at the very least. These will help teach you coping skills not dependent on medication. But of course don't stop your meds yet. Studies show having therapy in addition to meds actually helps recovery better. 

Be patient tho it may take months or years. And remember, however long it takes, it does not say anything about you as a person. Recovery time is different amongst individuals. Take care and all the best!"
62597,"Hello anyone taking CS3244 here? Could someone advice me on how to study this module? I've been watching the webcasts and there are so many things that are confusing me. In particular, all the equations and how to derive them. Is it necessary to know them all? Might be just me, but what is taught in lectures and the stuff we are required to submit for tutorials are completely different and I am quite lost :("
62596,"How can you be sure if the person you’re with is the one you want to marry? At this point, if my SO proposes to me, I don’t know if I will accept. Is there something wrong in our relationship? Or is this something all couples face? I feel so guilty for feeling this way. "
62595,"Incoming freshie here, just curious how hard isit to get into a hall? Saw many people saying need senior/friend in Hall to pull you in or have upz skills in sports. What if I'm just basic? Got chance anot? "
62592,"Any tips on how to fully absorb and retain material? I keep forgetting what i've ""learnt"" after finals... even making exam cheatsheets don't help because i'm c+p selected material and have to refer to them for every step."
62591,"As much as I am thankful for the counselling services provided by UHC, does anyone else feel like the help offered is very limited (time-wise)? In the sense that, only 6 sessions are offered per student for their entire candidature at NUS. This seems grossly insufficient for those suffering from mental illness and desperately need help but at the same time are bounded by the fact that they need to get better in 6 sessions or they are left to suffer alone. Furthermore, I doubt 6 sessions are sufficient for people who are severely suffering from depression or etc because obviously things have accumulated to the point where it has affected their mental stability. Given that NUS's global ranking is quite high, it is disappointing to see how little effort is put into helping students suffering from mental-illness. Shouldn't it be based on a case-by-case basis; meaning that if a person is having major depression, support should be given till the person recovers (rather than being forced to sign a form stating that only 6 sessions will be provided)? I get that it the counselling provided is only short term but this 6 sessions thing only works for those who aren't suffering severely from mental illness. 

And no, I don't fault the counsellors who work there because they are very overworked as it is. My point is, shouldn't NUS hire more counsellors to offer guidance for its students ; I mean a waiting time of 1.5 months for a first appointment (unless its an emergency, where you can walk in) seems a bit overboard and having maybe around 10-13 counsellors providing care for around 30 000 undergraduates seems a little insufficient? I've friends who underwent great psychological trauma but had to wait for 1.5 months to get help; because it wasn't an emergency per say but a very unfortunate incident. And to add on, the waiting time for following appointments are around a month? I know of so many people who gave up trying to get better because the gap was too long and just try to lead a normal life, with all that suffering. I've talked to friends from other unis and I don't think the waiting time for appointments are this long, and they are not limited to 6 sessions for their entire candidature. The number of sessions is dealt with on a case by case basis. I mean come on, isn't 6 sessions absurd for a person who is severely depressed? Even if it barely manages to help a person sort their issues out, there is definitely no opportunity for follow-ups (bc of the lack of sessions) to ensure that the person is coping well and won't fall back into that ditch. I feel that the NUS management is providing insufficient help in the area of mental health and that they really need to do something about it, especially with mental illness on the rise. Please look out more for our welfare, NUS.

(for those that suggest looking for help elsewhere, at charities offering counselling or etc bc its not as expensive, that's not the point. that should be a last case resort because every university should be able to provide adequate help for its students. The point is that the amount of help NUS is offering in the area of mental health is insufficient, and in fact much lower than that of other universities. go check out our local counterpart NTU, their counselling is stated to have sessions on a case by case basis; there's not restriction to the number of sessions offered)

tldr: counsellors in uhc are overworked. more counsellors should be employed to provide adequate help for students. and please provide sessions on a case by case basis rather than restrict it to 6 sessions from the start(cause this restricts recovery as well).if you're rational for 6 sessions is so that all students have an opportunity to receive help, please consider employing more resources; not cut back on the quality of help you are providing by restricting the number of sessions provided.

62590,"Hi, another cs student here. I am currently considering taking up a minor in either mathematics or statistics to make my resume look nicer. Any advise if this is useful at all or should i use my UEs for mods from different fields that i want to explore instead.
I am truly interested in learning the math/stats but i am also afraid my cap will tank. Is it worth it? "
62589,What are the most useful and popular portals for job application? Been using Jobstreet and CareerGov but not getting much calls. I also use NUS job portal but most postings are not applicable for me. Not sure if my resume suck or current job market is bad... 
62588,"hi OP of #62588, trust me, you having feelings for another man other than your bf is completely normal. I experienced this 'problem' many times. In fact this problem of mine resulted in 3 failed relationships, all of which ended because I started having feelings for another guy. 

Every time I have such feelings, I would gradually end my relationship and then start a new one with the guy I have feelings for. I gave my all in all my relationships and they were all great loving guys whom I admired. 

As a weak human, I gave in to temptations. I loved all the care and attention given to me and being told how different or special I am to someone whom I find attractive too. I would always tell them I already have a bf and we would agree to hang out as friends. But eventually feelings grew and I had to put an end to my own rs. It's like a vicious cycle. That is until I met someone. 

That someone is none other than my current bf of 3 years. My bf is an average student with an average background and a very average life, which consists mainly of studying, gymming and gaming. 

Throughout these 3 years, of course there were temptation everywhere. They were friends of friends, colleagues, people you meet at events and even some old crush you had. 

That old crush was the most difficult one. Logically speaking, he's more attractive than my bf because he's like really smart, good-looking, and accomplished. He's also a very sweet guy who always listens to you and tries to be there for you, which explains why I had a crush on him back then. But silly me didn't go for it because I thought he was too good for me. 

One day he appeared at one of our group outings after many years abroad. He started texting me, wanting to catch up. Eventually he wanted to hang out. So we had dinner frequently. He offered a listening ear whenever I needed it. Until one day he actually told me he wants to date me. 

My crush wants to date me!? What!? He even confessed that he liked me a long time ago but I sort of rejected him many years ago (I stopped replying him because I thought he wouldn't like me anyway). 

Now, this beautiful man happens to be my old friend and also happens to like me and want to date me. Isn't this like a fairytale? 

SAD. Sad that life isn't a fairytale. I rejected my old crush again. Why? I could always end my rs and start a new one with this old crush. But I didn't. Because I simply cannot imagine a life without my boyfriend. 

My bf may not be the smartest or most good-looking guy I know but he's the sweetest guy I have ever seen. He may be an average guy but his love for me is nothing like average. When you meet someone like that, please cherish him. Treasure him. Never let go of him.

It's easy to meet someone you like but it's so damn hard to meet someone who would love you wholeheartedly. 

And for those who aren't sure if your bf is the one you want to marry, the moment I rejected my crush is the moment I know for sure I want to marry my bf.

62586,"My girlfriend just asked me to get myself a fertility checkup before we decide to take our relationship further. I don't think I've got any issue but this means that if I'm infertile we're over right? Does my love and all the amazing time we had together meaningless if I can't make babies for you? Well we've gotten into a quarrel and haven't spoken about this since.
I guess I'll go take the test then. My brother can stand and shoot but a part of me fear for maybe I've got some problems I didn't know about and our r/s will just come to an end here. Hope all will be fine and I'll make you the baby you want."
62583,"Undeniably, the CS2100 final was extremely hard and I left almost 40% of it blank. However, I think Prof Aaron Tan really taught me a lot through this module and I actually really enjoyed it even though cramming for the finals was a nightmare due to the sheer amount of concepts involved. Thanks Prof Aaron, for being so patient and opening up so many consultation slots to help us, even sacrificing your lunch timings. Definitely an unforgettable module!"
62582,"Well this is more of an advice to incoming students/those who have never stayed in hall on hall life. I am what people consider a phantom in hall, and don't really socialise, so as compared to those who really hype up hall, I hope to give another insight from a phantom's point of view.

I have stayed for a year and don't plan on staying due to personal reasons. I did it for the ""experience"" as everyone calls it because freshies are entitled to 1 year without any commitments once they get allocated a slot (so if you really want the experience, here's your chance). So I'll discuss some pros and cons for you all, to make this easier and hopefully help you come to a better conclusion. (This is in reference to halls, I can't really say the same about PGP/RC/Utown residences). 

Pros:
1) Very near to school, especially if you stay like really far away, school is within walkable distance/at max 30min away with the ISB.
2) Pillar modules - in NUS, you have to take general modules (GE mods). In which, GEQ and GER are commonly placed in the 1st sem. GER requires groupwork (at least for my syllabus) and it is very convenient to meet up for projects. 
2.1) Additionally, the tutorial is located within hall premises (provided you managed to secure that particular slot), so you can literally walk down in your PJs and go to class in about 2 minutes.
3) Communal living, for the boys, think of it as army life, where you get to see your friends everyday, perfect for those who want an escape from home, and loves to socialise.

Cons:
1) If you plan to stay for the 2nd year and onwards, you need to commit in hall activities to rack up points. No points = no stay, as simple as that, meaning to say you gotta give up some aspects of your life for this
2) Inconsiderate neighbours. I'll be honest, this is inevitable no matter where, but in a communal living space, it gets worst. Imagine neighbours screaming and shouting for God knows what reason at like 1am in the morning (occassionally gets into trouble for it, but still happens). And blasting of music that can be really annoying if you're trying to study. *Not recommended for people who really need peace and quiet to study.
3) Peer pressure. Okay, I'll say that its true that nobody in hall will force you to do anything. You can say really just say no, but they'll keep asking you to join them and stuff, and if you're really susceptible to peer pressure, its very easy to succumb to this.
4) Last minute ""events"" - well, I'm not in the planning committee of any of this events, but especially if you have other commitments out there, this is one big turn off, as they can literally give you finalised details of an event 2-3 days before it and expect you to show up. With relation to number 3, yes you can say no, but then you'll get ostracised and people will just stop inviting you to events. Kinda sad ain't it. (yes no pressure to joining, but well they still ostracise)
5) Reference to number 1 - only if you're planning to use hall for your GE modules, but, can get really annoying when setting a time and date for presentation, as 80% of those in hall will be trying to stay, so they are in a committee/activity in one way or another, and it's insanely hard to find a proper timing to meet, usually will be like at 12am, so if you aren't ready for this lifestyle.... don't.

That's kind of what I can think of for now, but I hope this provides another insight and help you decide on whether you wanna stay in a hall or not. Things to take note will be:
1) Hall culture - well, different halls have different cultures, and by asking your seniors/friends who have stayed in halls, you can get a better idea of whether it is good or not
2) Cost - its around 2k/sem, making it 4k/year. EXCLUDING vacation stay, so if cost is an issue, do avoid (there's financial assistance schemes though)
3) Food - it isn't exactly the best thing in the world, but its still edible, just that its cooked in bulk, so don't expect anything fancy

Goodluck for finals for those already in Uni, and all the best to those who are about to join us in NUS."
62581,"Hello, hopefully some NUS admin can see this? I really hope that the teaching surveys will be reposted after the finals because I have so much feedback (constructive ones!) to provide for my tutors/professors but I really don't have the extra time to type those out while cramming for the exams. 

Timing is really important and I hope that the NUS admin staff will take these feedback on how to improve the teaching survey system seriously! I discussed with a few other friends and many said they do want to contribute their opinions but simply don't have the time. We don't want to give shoddy feedback or randomly check numbers off the rating scale in a big hurry. 

Neither do we want to email our tutors/professors directly to give them opinions on their teaching/module design because we all kinda feel more emboldened to comment behind the veil of online anonymity. 

So please do upload the teaching surveys again after finals! Thank you!

62578,"I don't know who this  Jonathan Choi is but I got relationship troubles to ask as well. 

What is an introvert male to do to get into a relationship? I don't understand how girls have it so much easier. They can be average-looking,  be super introverts or anti-social for that matter, or even have a toxic personality. They'll still have tons of guys chasing them. I'm sure even the nerdiest girl with braces, large specs, freckles and stammers at every sentence has had a guy confess to her before. 

Meanwhile a guy has to be a super social dude, and/or good-looking, know how to carry conversations, or super smart with an established future career, or/and rich already just to have any girl chase him. 

Or else, you get 0 girls.

1. Non-response bias from students who want value students who want to focus on their finals to save their CAPs rather than to improve the system (#62500)

2. Information bias from only selecting students when they have not been given the complete exposure to the module.

3. Selection bias from selecting people who are likely to give a more favorable (?) feedback having not been traumatised by finals.

However after being sexually active for a few months, her periods became more and more regular, and heavier and heavier (last time, it lasted 5 days).
