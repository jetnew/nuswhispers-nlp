58292,"Guess whose boyfriend forgot about valentines day today and is going clubbing with his friends today? He kind of just... forgot. I am disappointed but I am going to use today to love myself instead. I'm getting my hair and nails done, maybe a facial or spa if I'm feeling up for it. While waiting to bring my man home probably drunk, I'm going to binge watch our netflix series without guilt. I am going to the fancy restaurant I booked as a surprise and eat alone and I'm going enjoy it. I love you, but my happiness is worth more than your absence. "
58288,"My friend is depressed. He does not want to see a counselor because he can't open himself to a stranger. He says I can help him by simply keeping him company, but it feels hard to keep him company without being pulled down. I suggested to him that he should befriend more people to keep him company, but he claims that he can't do it with many reasons. I am trying to maintain a distance from him but he seems more depressed because of that. I am trying to take care of myself and I hope he can take care of himself too."
58286,"I hope that the people who bullied me and caused psychological torment and distress to me during my JC days get comeuppance and just desserts one day. Bullying is so serious. Even words have the power to emotionally hurt and scar people for life. Thanks to them I became so paranoid about the rumours, gossiping and slandering that I eventually developed an anxiety disorder and depression.

Meanwhile, I am staying committed to striving to become a stronger and better version of myself each and every single day. And I definitely have improved so much over the past few years. More resilient, more stronger, and mentally more tougher.

Okay, thanks for reading this... Just wanted to get it out of my chest... :)

P.S. The only regret that I have was that I was not more assertive in the past, but at that time I did not learn how to do so."
58284,"Hi, I am the one who posted #58259, the aspirating monk thing. Aspiring as in not a monk currently, but wish to be one in the future. It seems that a lot of people don't get that. I am still a lay person, have hair, normal clothes etc. So think of me as one of you, but just with a goal most of you do not have. Also, this is not a troll post. I realized that some of you think that it might be a troll post because you mistook me as a monk. That's a pretty bad image to put into your mind, I apologize. 

Also for those not familiar, being a monk does not make one automatically have no more lust. Mental cultivation is needed. So it's the path to reduce and eventually get rid of lust. But as long as I am a lay person, there is no reason why I should remain celibate, other than pre monk training.

Thanks for those saying FWB, I don't think my conservative self allows that too. I can't even think about it. Also, not much female friends I know who is that liberal, and attracted to me as fwb. 

Emotionally however, I am currently falling for a very pretty girl, good thing we live far apart from each other. But my logical, rational mind doesn't allow me to initiate chasing her at all, even as a what if fantasy. I got over the hating self thing due to this internal conflict, but just wish to rant here as the training does not recommend suppression of feelings, nor acting on lust, craving. Just merely observe it is good enough. I am just afraid too that this Valentine's when I met her in a public talk, I might confess. I really shouldn't. "
58283,"This Valentine's Day, I am gonna leave you for good. You knew I cheated when we were together and you said we should carried on. Okay....Great, I finally found the somebody who truly loves me despite my clubbing and hooking up days, you then were so, so willing to love me. Boy, I was terribly wrong. Fast track forward, giving you 3 kiddos ain't enough to show you how much I am willing to change to stay with you, you took it out on me using violence and verbal abuse (c'mon, beating me and reminding me how slutty I used to be and no one is gonna take me now. Ha! what a loser)!! Hey, hey, hey, be a man please. If you want to rack up my past and for us to divorce, just say so, just don't take it out on me anymore during your drunken state. 

Today, I will fulfil your wish, we are ending, I'm gonna pack up and leave. You can have everything (house, kiddos, money), I don't want anything to do with you anymore...."

58245,"Hi everyone. I'm not sure if I'm even allowed to make posts here, as I'm not affiliated with NUS in any way. I've been looking to pursue graduate studies at NUS, and one of my acquaintances informed me about this forum.

More specifically, I'm looking to pursue a Master's degree in computer science. I'm currently attending school in Korea (Korea University) and am about to enter my last semester. I've looked on the website and other Internet sources but haven't been able to find answers for my questions regarding the admission requirements.

Currently, my GPA is around 3.1-3.2/4.0. I don't have any official research experience, but I did work for about a year at a cryptocurrency/blockchain-related startup. I took the GRE last summer and got a 163V/169Q/5.5AW.

Right now I'm not sure what to do, since it also seems that NUS requires you to have at least two years of work experience in the IT field unless you have a bachelor's degree in computing. I switched majors in the middle, so I have a double major degree in international relations and computer science.

The realistic option that I've been considering is to complete a Master's degree at my own school (since the bar is relatively low for students who completed their undergrad at the same school) and then consider NUS for a PhD.

What would the community members recommend I do? "

58235,"I'm a foreigner staying in Singapore. I rented a room and am currently staying with the landlords. Previously, I signed a contract with them, in which we have agreed that the minimum period of stay is 8 months. My stay has been barely 3 months.

A few days ago, the landlords told me that they have relatives / friends visiting and they need my room to host them. They asked me to find another place to stay and said they'll give me two months for the rental search.

I am in fact totally fine with moving out, just that I have a lot of luggage to move. I hate moving house; every time I do that I feel super exhausted. Apparently, the landlords don't care. I told them I want to stay for the minimum period as agreed in the contract, but they said no.

I don't want to argue with them (there's nothing serious to be argued for). It will make things even more embarrassing. But then I'm wondering: if the landlords can sign a piece of contract and simply treat whatever is written inside as nonexistent, then what's the contract for?

58226,"Hey guys, year 3 Sociology student here.

In lieu of the new design-your-own-module initiative launched by NUS, I would like to get a rough gauge of the number of people who may be interested in taking a pass/fail module on anthropology and fieldwork.

I have pitched my idea to a couple of professors and they seem to be very willing to teach such a class.

Essentially, this module would cater to equipping students with the ability to conduct anthropological research in the field. I envision it to be the fourth methodology module (in addition to the three that sociology student already have - qualitative, quantitative, and visual ethnography). This module would take place within a specific field site (to be confirmed) and over the course of the semester, students would explore the field site from different perspectives. For example, the professor would examine the space from a historical perspective one week, and a social perspective in another.

What makes this module interesting would be how it allows the individual to engage with the SAME field site over the course of the semester and have first-hand experience and immediate feedback while conducting fieldwork. In some sense, this module would be very much like a field school but stretched over 13 weeks. This module would be theory-based but more technique base. Finally, I would also propose to invite several established field researchers/ research companies to help conduct some of the trainings or at least get them to come give us guest lectures. This would not only expose us to how commercial researchers work in the field, it would also allow us to make new connections with those already in the industry (which would be extremely valuable if you are interested to get internships/jobs in this field).

Anyway, this is just a rough idea and any constructive feedback would be much appreciated! Would help if you could perhaps comment if you're interested! Thank you for your time in reading this to it's entirety!"

Since then, I've resigned. Perhaps, getting your first choice in life is not as sweet as it seems. A first choice, perhaps, is either a choice out of practicality, or an over- glorified piece of white bread. Nevertheless, it is the interest to tinker, and play with things, that will drive me to carry on with that over-glorified white bread.

I have watched really sad movies before. I really never cried at all because even if the same thing happens to me, I won’t cry. It’s not like I don’t feel sympathy. 

If my mum die, I also won’t cry. Really. I have watched her fall asleep so many times, and I don’t cry all the way until she wakes up. Dying is the same as sleep what. If she sleep then I let her sleep, cry for what? Dying is you extend longer only, no?
