54799,"After removing plastic straws on campus, it's time to stop buying new smartphones and ban mindless use of screens on walkways and bus-stop. Perhaps, some wifi jamming may help.

54797,"#54797 It took me awhile to process it..but reading your confession brought out dredges of difficult feelings I thought I had forgotten about, stirred up wounds I had sought to bury under performances of happiness. (e.g. Even now, I get random epiphanies about something you told me that I now realise was a lie.) 

I hope for your sake that you see through all the unpleasant feelings, and even miraculously, the very fact of that person's toxic and manipulative self dries up even the last bit of affection you have for them, if it hastens your healing. 

I hope that you lean on trustworthy friends during this period, no matter whether you feel like you can do without them or not. I hope you will be honest with your heart, and protect it until it regains tranquility, and that when the door for a close romantic companionship opens for you, it will be the genuine, respectful gentleman you have always deserved and needed!

Like Andy said, it won't be easy to sort things out, but it has to be done. Take care of yourself dear. I wish for you the grace to dance through to the next scene of your life. Jy babe <3 "
54792,"Word of advice for guys - can you please stop fawning  over any girl who you find good looking but hardly know her character or that she has a shit/boring one but you keep at it in the hope you’ll get laid. You are ruining it for those who are more interested in the underlying substance. Have a look at a few makeup YouTube videos and you’ll realise how terribly easy it is to make yourself look however pretty ( or ugly ) you want to. Guys like you ruin it for everyone else because girls develop a contemptuous attitude towards us. And the ones with the shallow character never get the hint that it’s them. So,  remember this the next time you fall for her, you idiot! "

54783,"Hi #54775 (the one about the older boyfriend), I feel the exact same way as you. I am in a 3 year relationship with my girlfriend and I remember being super into her at the start but now we are in a 'lull period' as you put it and I think I am not in love with her anymore. not sure if this is a normal phenomenon of long relationships? do you guys experience this too or does the feelings still remain the same as before after a long long time? any opinions or advice?

54777,Any seniors who failed the mid terms for PL1101e and managed to do well for the finals to get a B-? I didn't study enough for the mid terms due to family issues so I did pretty badly. I enjoy studying psych but it seems like my chances are pretty slim since I do know that the bell curve would be quite steep as a lot of people want to major in it. Furthermore there's no placement tests this year onwards. I'm studying hard for the finals  now but I'm wondering  whether it'll be enough:(

(and sometimes he would drop everything and come for me if I am not feeling okay). 

Okay, I like him maybe that's why I am more curious. So how do I make him answer me? I mean he can don't like me also, is just that I want to know how he feels."

I usually have a heavy breakfast before coming to school and then eat some biscuits throughout the day so that I dont have to eat lunch in school alone.

54750,"Anyone finds it such a horrible idea whenever lecturers make their slides to have blank fields in them? 
Eg. A slide saying 'You need to ____ in order to...'

You can't read through the slides prior because of these lack of keywords and you can only fill up the annoying blanks when the lecturer goes through the topic on the day itself.

Another issue is that you lose attention during the lecture when busy filling up these blanks on the slides. 
When the lecturer is talking, everyone's busy filling up the blanks or whatever else. It's so stupid.

This also disadvantages people with attention issues who can't focus while listening and writing at the same time. I seriously don't get the point of why so many lecturers use this 'blank fields' practice for. If it's meant to have students pay attention to the lecture, it seems to be doing the very opposite of that.

Do upvote if you agree. Maybe lecturers can take note of this.
"
54749,theres really some people that really contribute zilch to group projects. its so funny and depressing at the same time. 
54748,You during finals:
54747,"Not even sure this will even reach you, and not sure that you'll even know it was me, but I guess it's worth saying.

After this year, our school will close down for good, and I guess that will be the last place with our memories that will close up. I really enjoyed my time with you.

I know we were both in bad places at the time, and that we were in really bad relationships at the time too, and I guess we both just sought comfort in someone else who knew what it felt like too. I knew she was cheating on you, and I guess I just wanted someone who knew what I was going through as well.

We were both misguided people. The first time I saw you I thought you looked cool with that camera, running around taking photos; you looked oh so popular, stopping every now and then to talk to someone and you seemed well liked by the teachers, your seniors and your level-mates. Has it really been 5 years since that day in J1?

I wanted to get to know you better. So I asked you to help me and my friends take a photo, and well, things took off from there. We spent afternoons studying together, and we told each other stories that we thought would never get out. We joked about everything, from the ugly bluish-green of the uniform to the strange expectations of the principal to random posts on confession pages (how ironic it is that I'm posting this on one) When she left you on read for a month I was there to cheer you up, and I guess it was then that our moments of weakness started. We just wanted some human contact, having been deprived of it for so long, and I guess having someone who understood so close by, it was hard to resist.

I think we both knew that it wasn't meant to be. But I caught feelings for you all the same. Every time you left my front door at the end of the day, it felt like I was missing something.

I distanced myself from you in J2, and you got involved with one of your CCA mates. I wondered about it, whether I should make a move on you, because I couldn't stand the sight of you guys being together. But I didn't. I was too scared to make that move.

And then it happened. Apparently your CCA mate hadn't broken up with her boyfriend yet before getting intimate with you, and things turned ugly. And I wanted to be there for you, but I didn't want you to see me as desperate, or for you to be seen as some fuckboy who changes girls oh-so-often. But we lost contact. Your Instagram disappeared in J2, and only recently have I found your new account. 

You're happily attached now. I guess I'm just too late.

I wish you all the best :), I hope we can still be friends, someday, and you can maybe introduce me to your girlfriend as a friend, because I guess that's as much as I can hope for now.

I'll just try to get over you as best I can then. I guess I'll have more chances to bump into you next year when Techno closes down, and if I do, I hope you won't be a stranger. You don't have to say anything, or even acknowledge what we were, but I hope we can still be friends. Hopefully I'd have my feelings for you all sorted out by then.

54744,some people complain about NUS no straw campaign. you come NTU you gotta pay 20 cents per plastic bag. 
54742,For real #54733????? I am a female who had used dating apps before and when I see guys with pictures taken with girls on Tinder I would most likely swipe left lol.
54741,#54741 I have to agree with you. This sem's goodie bag is reallly disappointing. Even if they were focusing on 'quality'.. it isn't really there either. 
54736,"I hate how we ended.

Were we really nothing?

You're happy with her now, and I'm just left wondering what all those days were about. Were we really nothing?

You ended it so unceremoniously before you enlisted, and yet even then you'd still ask me out. It felt like we were still dating even after.

Now, one year plus into uni, and it still sucks to see you around, doesn't help that our canteen is shared. I'd get lunch at macs but you go there too sometimes. It just sucks.

Were we really nothing?"
54735,"There is a senior from my CCA that I am attracted to. During CCA, he would often come over and chat with me (even though we are not on the same team) and is also very patient in teaching me. As he is quite shy and awkward around other girls, I thought he is single and maybe have some liking for me too. 

However I found out that he actually has a girlfriend. I might have felt better if I found out about this from social media or friends, but instead, I only realised when his girlfriend suddenly joined the CCA too. I tried to be friendly to his girlfriend and start a conversation with her when my senior left for a short while (after all I will be seeing her again so I thought at least we could become friends) but she just gave one-word answers which made me even more upset than I already was. She was only interested in talking to my senior even though my senior tried to include me and another guy in the conversation, and it became quite awkward that we left them alone. However I couldn't help but keep looking over to the both of them. I have never seen my senior so happy and talking so much before..

It has been a few days already but I still feel very upset. I really want to get over him but I can't stop thinking about him. I know it is foolish as it is just a one-sided feeling, but no guy has ever been so nice to me and attracted me so much before. I can't stop replaying in my head the moments when he introduced his gf and I was trying not to show my disappointment, and how he still looked out for me to make sure that I was doing fine. I still want to remain friends with my senior, but I really don't know how to act as if I am ok in front of him (and his gf) now :("

54706,"Where do people find their closest friends that they hang out with on the weekends? It seems like all my friend groups just stopped keeping in contact when we moved on to the next stage of life. (To uni, to JC etc.) It's quite depressing really, it makes me wonder if there is something wrong about me, or are most friendships this way? They say uni is the time you build the most precious friendships that will last a long time, but I am so doubtful. I am already in Year 4, and I can't really find someone I can be genuine towards. It seems like everyone communicates on a very superficial level, and you never really know what the person really feels about you as a friend. They may still smile, say hi to you, and joke with you, even if they're constantly badmouthing about you to other people. And I know, because I have seen it happen. Why can't people just be more upfront about what they feel?"
54705,"#54705 I get what you mean, and I think I had the same issue too. My ex and I lasted about slightly less than a year, and though he wasn't rich, far from it, he was really crazy smart and good looking. Last I heard he's keeping a 4.9 CAP, but during our relationship he'd go MIA too so perhaps it's working for him.

It was in the second year of JC that we broke up and while I understood that both of us had to focus on A levels being from a lower end JC (we got merged, even), I really hated the MIA period where he'd take like a day to reply to my messages, and sometimes reply only at the end of the week or so.

He'd tell me that we needed to focus on our studies, but I mean, we're in the same school, and the same CCA, so it's not really out of the way if we met up after classes... right? I thought I was being too clingy too, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

I guess he's moved on, he got attached to someone else less than a year ago, but I've not managed to form any lasting relationships since, and I think I'm still not over him.

I guess all I can say is do what you think is right? If you still have lingering feelings I guess it's best you work them out, with or without him. It's definitely not right to neglect your relationships over studies, at least not to the point of total MIA. I'm still trying to work my feelings out too, so I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but I hope you get your closure soon."

54700,"I know this is going to sound damn pretentious but I hate having a high CAP.

Background: I'm an Engin student and my major+DCP has a lot of group projects. I have five group projects this sem.

Recently, I found out from a mutual friend that two of my groupmates are intentionally slacking off. This mutual friend also informed me that they said they could slack off because they know that I can tank their parts. When she asked what if I'm not willing to tank for them, they replied that I have to because I need to maintain my CAP, and anyway this particular project has no peer evaluation.

So their thinking is that I have a lot to lose by getting a B, while they have less to lose since their CAP is already at that level. Thus they can relax because I will work my ass off to complete it anyway, since I'm aiming for FCH.

But what they don't know is that I still have extra S/Us. We'll see who has the last laugh."
