52499,"I'm fine. 
Does people understand what this word ""I'm fine"" really means? 
Everyday I go uni, sitting with friends for lec and lunch. But none of whom I can share what I'm going through with, just when I thought I found 2 person that I can share stuff with, things changed. No replies from her , just getting ignored casually. It kind of hurts but I have to pretend I don't mind.because after all, we only known each other for 2months since orientation. 
Everyday it gets tougher having to keep every single thing to urself, and appearing fine in front of others. And it's getting tiring and hard. 
I'm fine , turn it around  and it becomes save me. Having no one to be able to really talk to, is taking a toll on me emotionally"

52488,"Saw this guy at S17 bus stop one afternoon last week and it triggered a really uncomfortable memory.

About 5 years back, I was at an event that was hosted at NUS Utown for a few days. I remember talking to the leader of one of the smaller delegations or teams, and we hit it off quite well.

At this point he was attached, but was going through some issues in the relationship and I can't really remember how but on the second night he sneaked me into his room and things got a bit frisky.

So about a week later we met up at my place for a date and to have sex, but eventually it didn't work out too well. After a few more dates we decided to call it quits and we were never really officially together, I guess.

So I don't know why seeing him together with his girlfriend in school triggered such a uncomfortable feeling, like as if I'm still emotionally involved in this? I'm not sure what was worse, the fact that he didn't seem to recognise me, or the fact that he's happily in a relationship while I'm just another forgotten memory to him.

Before any of you guys jump on this, I don't think he's from NUS from the clothes he was wearing, and I haven't seen him around school, so I don't really need to ""avoid"" him or anything, just wondering if anyone has ever felt the same thing.

52485,"Are guys really that concerned about their height?

I'm currently seeing tis guy and even though he's about a couple heads taller than me but he still has lots of height issues.

One of my past dates was about 165cm, and he slightly taller than me so you guys can have a gauge of how tall I am, and I mean, he used to joke about why he was glad that I don't wear a headdress (I'm malay and he's chinese) because he was worried the extra height from the fabric will make me taller than him... but he's a jeans and hoodie kind of guy so I used to tell him that he could just hood up. I mean its like he dint seem to take it as much of an issue though he was clearly shorter? We met while he was attending to me in camp so maybe it was the extra boost of confidence from the uniform... But that confidence really turn on ah ;).

Before anyone asks, yes, I'm a girl.

Meanwhile my current boyfriend is slightly taller than average height and still need me to reassure him every day that he's tall enough? 

Like I get if you are insecure about it, but do you really need to mention it every time it crops up? I try to be reassuring n such, bt there's a limit to things la. Like compare to the other guy is complete turn off la sia."

Yes it is possible for the guy to go at least one more round after ejaculation, perhaps not all the time though. I’m speaking from my own experience with my boyfriend...

52458,"Met this guy on tinder, while he serving NS a couple years back - I think he should be in Year 2 by now?

We hit it off and went on a few dates, but sadly we lost contact. I'd heard he was looking at entering my current course and since it's a small course I'd hoped to meet him again, but it seems that I haven't seen him around at all.

I've seen his name on the mentor list released by my department; it's quite easy to spot really, he's probably one of the first few, given the starting letter and how small the course is in general.

He's deactivated tinder since then and I haven't really had a chance to meet up with him again - he didn't have social media, so it was only through tinder that we communicated, kinda strange, but well.

Well here's hoping he hasn't been taken by someone else yet :')… though I know that's kind of a fat chance, considering how many matches he seemed to get...

52457,"Dear DAO2702 staff, i don't understand why there is no change after only a handful out of hundreds of students taking this module, actually show up for lecture every week. 

It is obviously because we do not find the lectures useful (trust me, we're business students and we'll definitely attend anything we find beneficial for us). 

Furthermore, the recorded videos per week can easily exceed 3 hours? What is even more frustrating for us students is even when we x1.5-2 speed, the speaker is still talking so slowly with so many uhhhs, ummms. Please plan your lessons and videos for god sake.

We were good friends of more than 3 years. I was there for her whenever she needed me. I lent her my ears when she had troubles; I let her cry on my shoulders; I gave her advice when she asked for some, even though she never followed them. Till today, I am still keeping the darkest secrets that she entrusted upon me, and I intend to take them to my grave, even though she hurt me. 

We were good friends. However, there came one semester where I had heavy CCA commitments that I was struggling with, and I could no longer be physically there for her. We met much less frequently; I apologised whenever I couldn't make it to meet-ups (I don't ghost. I made sure to notify at least a few days in advance if I couldn't make it), and sought her understanding that I was having a hard time juggling with my CCA, school, and part-time work. Instead of comforting me, she chose to shun away, avoiding texts and all forms of communication. When I finally ditched my schedule to meet, she had already moved on from our friendship. Our usual dialogue became more like an interview, a monologue. I felt the discomfort that surged between us. 

That night, I was unable to sleep. I recalled the past 3 years of our ""friendship"", and realised that it wasn't true at all. For the past 3 years, I was there for her whenever she needed me, yet during the 3 months (just 3 months!!!) when I was struggling the most, she abandoned me. Since then, she only texts me to ask for favours (not to ask how I'm doing, or what I'm up to, but to take advantage of my lingering feelings). It took me some time to get over our ""friendship"", but ever since I did, my soul feels so much more cleansed and calm having disposed of such a toxic friend. 

If you are reading this and have faced a similar experience, please share! That feeling of having your body and soul cleansed of toxic friends is so much more powerful than any juice cleanse :').
