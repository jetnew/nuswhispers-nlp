54198,"Looking at girls who know how to dress up, makes me think about how I want my girlfriend to know how to dress up as well. I fell for her because of her beautiful heart, and not for her looks. But now, I feel so superficial for wanting her to look better, but I want her to look better. How do I get rid of this instinctive feeling of wanting a pretty girlfriend?

I missed the orient camp and have no CCAs as of now, have made a few guy friends as of now but very lost as to how to make close friends with a girl much less get a legit GF. I was aiming to get one within first few weeks of uni but i seem to have failed miserably and very lost as to what to do to get a GF quickly within the shortest time frame. Thx"

54194,"The whole thing on banning straws is just stupid. Considering the amount of carbon you can cut down from plastic straw is just ridiculous. After travelling to so many nearby tropical countries, it is very obvious that our air conditioning temperatures are much colder. If you walk into a random classroom in campus, chances are the A/C are running even if it is vacant. If we were to turn up the indoor air conditioning temperature from the current chilly 21/22 deg c (where people are often observed dress in sweaters or winter clothes) to a reasonable 24/25 dec c, it is way more effective. Banning all plastic straws globally at once will make negligible effects on the amount of emissions, turning up indoor temperatures in Singapore is going to make a huge impact globally. Imagine the amount of CO2 being cut down from lower electrical consumption. and if you factor in the lower amount of waste heat released into the environment which in turn reduce the amount of air conditioning needed. All along we have been focusing on the wrong area, meanwhile, if you feel more convenient to use plastic straw just go ahead, but remember to turn up the temperatures and turn off A/C when not in used. "
54193,"Hey #54193, thanks for the update!! but how do I access that lost and found system? :DD"
54192,Do you think major companies that are producing tons of waste will be willing to cut down on waste if people can’t even avoid straws or reduce the number of straws they use? A wasteful culture has been so deeply entrenched in society that everyone is making a big fuss out of the straw movement. At least reduce the number of straws you use to help save the environment. Every little bit of effort counts. One can’t expect companies and corporations to be the ones changing when we can’t even allow ourselves to waste one less straw a day. 
54187,"Hey peeps, there is a girl in a lecture theater recently that caught my eye and I would like to take her out on a date. But then again, this kind of dating culture is particularly not well liked as it is deemed to be a creepy or desperate move from the guy? So how shall I approach this situation? Or is this just a case of girls not seeing it as creepy/desperate if the guy asking her out is dashing?"

54181,"I'm a year 3 student with clinical depression and anxiety. I have a very good s/o, and he's really considerate towards my problems and always makes sure I'm feeling okay, but I do feel like I'm not good enough for him at all. 

My family has a lot of issues with finance and that really puts a lot of stress on me to work part time and study, as well as my course which is ""prestigious"" and has a really heavy workload. A lot of times I feel like we should break up simply because I'm not good enough. 

I do try my best to be a good girlfriend, like I will treat him to food sometimes (he insists on treating me food all the time, but I always insist we go on Dutch.), and I will play video games with him, and I just really want to be a good match for him, but I'm not. 

I'm ridden with mental illnesses, and I cry at least once a day while he takes time out of his busy schedule to comfort me. He's really popular, has many friends, is a responsible, warm, positive and kindhearted guy and I'm pretty sure quite a lot of girls like him. On top of that, he's good looking too. Meanwhile, I'm introverted, and I find it difficult to make friends. I stutter when I talk to new people. (Seeing the NUSWhispers post about a girl wanting to bed a higher than average guy from her course just so that he would break up with his very average gf makes me nervous. I feel like I'm that average gf.)

I just don't see what's good enough about me, (I don't think I'm very pretty) and I do want to suggest breaking up just so that he gets someone better than I am. Physically wise, I also have asthma and I get unwell easily, so he will drop his schedule just to take care of me and sit by my bed until I fall asleep, without asking for anything in return. He's always there for me, no matter how tired he is. 

I am trying to work on my depression and anxiety and get better for his sake, but it's just so hard to get up in the morning. Sometimes I don't tell him when I'm sad, because I know he will get really worried about me. 

What should I do? He deserves so much better than me, but I really do care so much for him. I'm just struggling so hard to handle everything along with my low self esteem.

54180,"I have a reasonable amount of friends to keep me going in school, decent grades and background, but actually I’ve turned to counseling since a while back. Nothing to be ashamed of. It’a something I choose not to let others know , for I believe it is a ongoing and personal process in helping me get over my inner struggles and uncertainties I feel about my life. There are some things I just don’t feel like discussing openly with people and prefer a third party’s opinion on it"
54179,"To #54311

Hello! Glad that you enjoy watching 2D1N as well! :) really recommend everyone to give them a go!! Anyways, haven’t managed to give your recommendation of Knowig Brothers a go, but will do so when the sem ends!"
54175,"I feel really sad being completely alone in uni. There's no real friends to be found here. The only thing that has me going is seeing some people also eating alone in the canteen. It's at least better than seeing no one eating alone back when I was in sec school. Such  a thing was absolutely non-existent back in poly and sec school.


I admit though, I'm kind of like a half-retard that can't keep up with conversations so I've never been good at socialising. But it's also that and a slew of bad decisions I made, one of which was coming to NUS in the first place.


I really regret not applying for any hall or RC but I guess none will likely accept me anyway, unlike NTU where it's confirmed you'll get a slot. I really wanted to live a vibrant campus life living alongside fellow schoolmates but hey, my achievement record sucks, so I guess I'm not qualified enough for this 'vibrant campus life' in NUS. 
Even if I applied next sem/next year for hall/RC, what does it matter?


Meanwhile I joined tried joining different CCAs, one of which hardly meets at all and is practically non-existent to me.  

Groupmates are just hi-bye friends and relationships just slowly strain away when they see how incredibly stupid I am and how stupid I speak.

Classmates shun me since I act like a half-brained idiot and constantly screw up in class and what friends I try to make never really become friends.

 While these people can talk and laugh with each other, when they speak to me, it's always in some formal tone like speaking to a stranger. Not one person has ever treated me more than that apart from my family. Never in my life. That's who I ever am to everyone. 10 weeks later and still treated like a 'stranger' by everyone.
 
It's been years but I'm used to it by now so no, I'm not depressed. I'm literally immune to depression at this point. Funny, huh? To those of you struggling with loneliness too, don't worry, you'll become immune to depression eventually. You won't feel that heartache that much anymore. 
Society is created that way. Those that can socialise will always win. Those that can't will just get worse and worse.

54173,"It's a shame how people can come up with so many excuses to not contribute a little to conserving the earth that is NOT ours.
Sure, the campaign was executed poorly. But aren't we all cockroaches who make do whenever top-down decisions are imposed on us?

There are bigger factors that are contributing to waste, but do you think you are the only one, so minor that it validates your daily contribution to unnecessary waste? Well, says the rest of the world. Straws are just a tiny part of the problem? Take 10 million of them and I'll see how you can shove them up your pampered a$$.

How about we stop making excuses, and make some effort to create a little less waste? No one is telling you never to use straws or plastics, but a reduction of even 10% of your wastage can slow down the speed at which waste is occupying space. I'm not sure if this will be posted, but I'm not going to bother with the comment section because those ""witty"" comments are basically sad, lame trolls prowling around this page. "
54172,Hi guys. so I have a problem and I'm hoping you could help me out. I have been with this guy for about a year now. We both love sex. But there's a problem. His house always has people and my house is also always occupied.. so it makes it q difficult to have sex at home.. we resorted to having sex in some handicap toilets but I feel quite comfortable as some toilets aren't exactly the cleanest or the most nice smelling.. What do you think of this situation? I've mentioned this to him before but he always just shrugs it off.

54169,"I don't know if I'm depressed or not.

I'm not suicidal or anything, but some of the symptoms I could relate to. Sometimes I can't pull myself out of bed, I don't have motivation to do work and I don't find much joy in drawing which used to be my hobby. I attributed it to me being lazy and procrastinating. Just recently, I got scolded quite badly by my tutor during consultation for shoddy work and not emailing him when I skipped the previous lesson. I guess it goes to shows that he cares but I was trying very hard not to break down and cry in front of him and some of my peers that also came for consultation.

I know it's my fault. I deserved being told off because I didn't do my work properly. But I don't know if I should blame my laziness or depression. I don't want to make light of depression. I'm scared of going to get professional help to find out at the end of the day I'm not depressed, I'm just lazy. 

Is there any other way I can deal with this?"
54167,"I am a student in NUS. I was having a fever on the afternoon of 26 October 2018, Friday. I took some medication but still felt unwell. As such I decided to go to the clinic at University Health Centre. However, I was met with rude staff who were extremely unpleasant.


Knowing that I will be reaching at about 5pm, I called beforehand to ask if I could register through the phone call first. However, that did not work. Despite so, I was understanding and understood that registration could only be done at the counter. Do note that I only called once. 

When I reached, the doors were about to be locked. However, the reception was closed. Since I was there already, I just went to ask and check if I could still register. 


At the reception were two female staff. One had  black straight hair in a bob hairstyle. The other staff was quite plump, and was wearing spectacles. 


I told them that I felt feverish. They then told me to measure my temperature. As I was doing so, they spoke in dialects, thinking that I would not hear or understand them. They said that I was rude to barge in when they were closing. The staff with spectacles even told the other staff that I called 10 times beforehand! And all this commotion was happening just right in front of me! I was shocked that I was faced with such rudeness. They were not even being discrete that they were talking about me.


The thermometer then showed that my fever had gone done, because of the medication that I had took earlier. The staff then mocked me for creating a mountain out of a molehill when I was totally fine.


I am shocked that the clinic had such rude staff who told lies and gossiped about patients. In addition, the gossip was done right in front of the patients! Being a clinic in a prestigious university, I had expected the staff to be properly trained and well-mannered. It was definitely appalling and disappointing."

54154,"A number of posts have been talking about depression. One would do well to discern if one has clinical depression or is merely feeling down. In many of the narratives I have read here, it seems that the OP actually has certain expectations about life and being in uni that can't be met. This is causing him/her distress. 

A tough eduation and hard time is necessary for growth. We should accept that, learn to improve and give ourselves a chance to be better with every day. On the other hand, it is our stubbon expectations of what we think life should be like that give us sadness and depression. 

Many of us are not clinically depressed but wallow in our own sadness. Even for the clinically depressed, trigger points can be identified and the knowldege that it is our self-defined unmet expectations that is significantly contributing to our mental crunch. "
54152,"The ongoing ireject (straws) campaign is nothing more than a bunch of self-righteous environmental activists forcifully imposing their will on the vast majority of the population while ignoring the inconvenience they may bring to the population. Don’t get me wrong, I do think that we should reduce waste generation, but the sudden abolishment of the use of straws throughout campus has caused nothing but inconvenience.

At the present state, the stalls are just not ready to stop the provision of straws, especially for takeways. If we are ordering a drink while dining in, I agree that we could omit the use of straws. But for taking away, the cups used are simply not convenient by themselves, especially if we want to carry the drinks around (say on a bus) or drink on the go. Provision of lids would solve the problem if I want to dabao a drink back for say a class, but it would just be useless trash if I decide to drink on the go (since I don’t have straws in the first place, I have to remove the lid in order to drink). There are drinks out there that are packaged in a way that is “takeaway-friendly”, e.g. macchiato from Koi.

I just don’t think we are ready for this movement of rejecting straws (and lids) for takeaways until we can rectify this problem. Even for dining in, I do not think that people should be deprived of the option of having straws. Of course, any environmentally conscious person should not use straws unnecessarily, but the stalls should at least be able to provide straws for those who request for it, perhaps with a nominal charge."

54143,"#54110: yes it occurs to all humans. 

Friendships and international relationships are pretty similar in principles. One at individual scale, one at a larger scale.
But always remember microscale is really the basis of larger scale. ie our human characteristics collectively determine international relationships. 

The two basic principle for all things are:

1) The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.
2) There are no permanent friends only permanent interest.

they are nice to you coz you have something to offer. they are stronger than you (more popular), but want to make use of your time/effort. but once your help ends, they being more popular has little incentive to be nice to you.

As you are weaker, less popular, and social clout, termination of your aid to them, renders your friendship very useless. Unless they think you have something to offer to them in the future, they do not need to actively maintain the friendship bridge.

But it pays to be nice to people, coz you do not know when you need their help. Sometimes, it pays to help them even if no return. for eg, to allievate you guilt, to make yourself feel better. "

And studies have shown that this initiative has in fact increased energy consumption because of demand surges after Earth Hour. Similarly, plastic straw bans were rolled out in many places around the world with much controversy and debate as well. So we have to be thoughtful about what banning straws was supposed to achieve, otherwise meaningless campaigns like this (which really feels like micromanaging tbh) will just give the public a bad impression on the environmental-friendly movement, and worse still give people a naïve opinion on what environmentalism really is all about."

I reached out to this friend after a long time of not speaking to each other, and we bonded really well. It felt like we fell exactly back in place where we left off. The dynamics were the same. We got each other's jokes. We could confide in each other without the fear of judgement. I remembered how good it used to feel. 

I got the warm fuzzy excited feeling of anticipation - the thrill of a renewed bond, the emotional satisfaction of a fulfilling companionship after such an extended period of emptiness despite being in a relationship. A spark was re-ignited in me.  I felt alive, and it wasn't all grey and dull and sad inside I saw bits and pieces of colours. Of hope. 

I think it was then I realised I'm actually doing a heinous, abominable thing - not only had I emotionally cheated (no excuses regardless of how brief or how unconscious it was) but I had also exploited the companionship this friend was willing to offer. This friend was loyal, sincere and kind - almost to a fault. I know this friend was not  romantically attracted to me but I couldn't help feeling the way I did.   

When I realised this, I was absolutely disgusted by myself. I hated myself to the core. How could I do such a thing? It's being extremely unfair to the two persons i care about and that is not okay. 

I decided to delete that friend from my contact list and suppress all urges to get in touch again. I never told my ex about it. 

Keeping it a secret was an overwhelmingly horrible feeling and I continued to be enveloped in disgust and contempt at the kind of person I am, the kind of person I have become. 

I have never clarified this matter with either of the parties involved. And to this day, I still feel guilty about it - even though I believe none of them truly cares anymore. 

I don't know how you will ever know this is for you. I guess i can only pray that the telepathy that used to exist between us remains intact. 

I just want to say I am really sorry for the way I treated you and our friendship. It's a horrible move on my part, and I acknowledge my mistake. I am learning to cope with being on my own and control the instinctive urge to find someone, anyone to fill the gap and silence. Now I force myself to sit with loneliness, to befriend it, to understand its core - and to overcome it. 

I hope that wherever you are now, whatever you are doing, you are safe and happy. But I  know you will be okay. 

I wish you nothing but the best in life. And if we ever speak again, I promise I will treat you the way you deserve to be treated. 

TLDR: don't take advantage of people's kindness to compensate for your own emotional needs "
54104,"#54066: Thank you for trying to knock down the walls of an introvert. But like #54080 mentioned, please talk to your clique beforehand. I had the same experience where someone tried to befriend me and their clique, the clique acted super friendly in front of the nice person, the moment said person left for other lessons, the rest of the clique disappeared as fast as lightning. Needless to say, my walls got back up even stronger from then on"

54101,"If we plot a relationship as a directed graph and realize none of them are bidirectional, then that is a sad story. Well, last but not least, the worst story would be having a cycle in the graph."
54100,#54048 I hope you realise what you implying here. Are you saying that women have better character than men and that they aren't superficial at all? Please do think of an intelligent answer before replying.
