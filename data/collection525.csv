52593,Congratulations to the challenger team! Happy you guys won by such a big margin. Glad to do my part! Jiayou! Let our votes speak to the exiting team
52592,"With the release of the NUSSU exco rep elections results, the bitter campaign season has drawn to a close, at least for those of us plebians not on a management committee. Those who are, however, are likely to see even more drama in Saturday's council meeting. However, here's a quick highlights of interesting points in the vote results.

-Arts Club showed an outsized turnout of 455 valid votes cast, the largest among the faculty clubs. Even accounting for FASS being the largest faculty, the percentage is still higher than almost all other clubs, reflecting a more politically engaged student body.

-Clubs which were not contested at all, such as Business and Science, showed a correspondingly depressed turnout.

-The insider team's presidential candidate came within 14 votes of losing his seat in Computing Club, despite it being an uncontested race, and was the poorest-performing candidate to be elected. Another sign of the massive drama surrounding this election, as he was previously elected president of Computing Club 2 years previous.

-SDE had the challenger team's single losing candidate, losing by a wide margin to the insiders' two candidates.

-Engineering Club had the most exciting race of all, with candidates on both sides being popular among the student body and the challenger team's presidential candidate running there. It came down to an extremely narrow victory for the challenger team, with 6 votes separating their less popular candidate from the insider's more popular candidate. Percentage turnout for the vote, however, was below the average for contested faculty clubs.

-University Scholars Club (the faculty club for USP) had both the highest turnout by far (305 valid votes out of a total population of ~800) and the highest approval rating for the challenger team's (uncontested) candidate, at 98.7%. As USP students can vote both here and in their respective faculties, this offers some insight into how critical USP and Tembusu support was for the challenger team, in particular for RC-Engin students who most likely decided the ~20 vote winning margins in Engin club.

-For the non-faculty clubs, the real shocker was in NUSPA, an uncontested race with one challenger and one insider candidate. The insider candidate failed the vote of confidence by 15 votes, in an election limited to Singapore Citizens, depriving them of a critical exco rep seat.

As it stands, the challenger team has lost by a hair's breadth, with 9 candidates elected to the insiders' 11. The next round of elections for NUSSU positions will be internal, limited to those elected here and representatives from the constituent clubs."

52575,"How do people make friends in Uni beyond the mere hi-bye classmates that last a semester? Currently year2, and for the past semesters I have put in effort to initiate conversations with people, get their numbers etc. However eventually it became obvious that they are not interested in being friends (e.g does not initiate any convos at all online, and irl they are probably ""forced"" to do so). I am the only one who was initiating talks.

I do not like to appear as being too desperate for friends, hence usually when this happens I tend to let it go and stop talking to them when the semester ends. 

I am starting to wonder if the problem lies with me or is it a common thing in Uni? I am fine with being alone or with just hi-bye classmates, however I just feel a slight regret if I cant get to experience this social part of University life that others can.

So what do people usually do to make friends in Uni? Do you still continue to try to talk to people who dont seem interested/dont bother to intiate convos, in a hope that they will change their opinion about you? Or does it all boils down to luck."

52572,"Referring to my previous confession #52572,
1. I want to clarify that the quiet girl in my FAS1101 tutorial stole my idea which the prof asked me to discuss in the previous tutorial. I just wanted a way to complain and de-stress myself and just in case the girl sees the confession, she will feel guilty.

2. I had a new essay done at the cost of not sleeping for a night on that day.

3. I am on a scholarship requiring a certain CAP for my degrees. (For those who said I need to improve my writing, despite my A Levels rankpoint, I come from a poor family background and my parents are hawkers who communicates in Chinese and tries their best to afford my school fees.) I was very depressed when someone implied that I am spoilt and complained for no reason.

4. It has been stressful for me to take ddp but I really need the scholarship to pay the school fees and travel fees. Without it, I will probably drop out of uni.

5. I wrote the previous confession when I was sick with a high fever. I have been on and off sick for a month now due to burning midnight oil daily."

52551,"Recently, I was very inspired by the mental health awareness campaign Beyond  The Label launched this month by NCSS. I knew some of the ambassadors of this movement because they came out with their mental health struggles openly, even with the stigma surrounding them. 

I like to share my challenges here, and hopefully encourage people to share theirs. The best way to get rid of prejudice is by listening,  understanding and empathising. I don't know who would care about what I have to say - but I know that it has always made me feel better when I read similar struggles by others and I know I'm not alone. 

I am not clinically diagnosed with any sort of mental disorder, but I am a generally anxious person who gets worried way, way, WAY too easily. Just because there's no official diagnosis from the doctor doesn't mean the symptoms is less severe/paralysing.

I can ruminate on the same things for hours on end each day - just trying to connect all the possible causes, reasons, factors why the things that happened to me happened, and what the bigger problems are that lie ahead of me. 

I contemplate suicide on a weekly basis, I google ""I want to die"" more times than I can remember. I have almost concrete plans on how I want to leave - including plucking up the courage to write goodbye notes to my loved ones. Never completed them though - it felt too painful to write on.

When I tell people I think I'm not gonna live past a certain number of years, I see skepticism in their eyes. I know they don't believe me when I say I want to die. I wish i could choose not to believe in myself too.  

Last month has been my worst struggle with this anxious/depressed mood. A slew of unfortunate things hit me in unexpected and continuous waves. I was swept by the harsh currents of life's maelstrom and I am still slowly piecing myself back together from the utter wreckage that is my current existence. Sometimes the half-built puzzle threatens to crumble entirely. 

My health is irretrievably in shambles, the one I trusted most has left me at my most vulnerable state, I'm struggling to keep up in school, my family is distant and aloof. 

Everyday feels like a struggle to wake yourself up. Sometimes I hope to sleep much longer because reality is so painful to confront.

But I'm still here. 

And that's the most important thing guess? Sometimes I have to remind myself how strong I am because despite all of that which has smacked me, I am still here. I'm still breathing, existing, trying even I'm failing to succeed. 

Amidst the pleas of ""please kill yourself"" roaring through my head, I hear a tiny whisper, barely audible but  unmistakable - 

""Keep holding on."" I hope you hold on too. "
52550,"Is there a way to create a new CCA in NUS? Does the uni allow this? I recall walking through the SL fair and just not getting any interest in anything. Why do all the CCAs/clubs have to be so specific and driven toward only a certain interests? Why can't we have some recreational clubs like a study group club, or weight loss club or food/cooking club or gaming club? There are some sports CCAs missing too, such as a swimming or soccer for example.

I really to build up some social life here, esp since I'm not staying hall, but it's pretty hard if I have to commit myself to some CCA I don't even like.

52518,"If anyone is still following the nussu election drama... I have to say it is a really sad tussle between 2 sides for what amounts to not more than honorary titles. So far, both teams have had their fair share of grouses and jabs, and it has been fun watching from the sidelines.

However, the filed notice for EOGM, which has been spearhead by a student with apparent (not necessarily actual) support for the ""Concerned Students"" group is particularly concerning. If this comes to pass, what essentially will happen, based on my interpretation, is that the fate of some candidates for the nussu elections, which has been participated by a wider student electorate, can be nullified by what is most likely a much smaller group of students (as few as 100 students needed to vote!), a group who is willing & able to be present at ONE specified time and place to physically vote on whether the election results of particular candidates could stand. I see 2 issues with this agenda:

a) While accountability is critical and necessary, the call for election candidates to present their clubs' financial statements, with the potential for ruling them out solely because of their involvement strikes as counter-intuitive. Significantly, this will be decided before any proof of irresponsibility in their roles, if any. What this amounts to is that those who contributed as a leading member of these clubs can be ruled out of the election even if their finances are in order, but are barred, simply because OSA rules or bureaucracy (or whatever) has prevented the release of finances. More significantly, this is a form of disincentive for future students keen to serve in nussu, but are afraid of facing similar constraints that other students, who happen to run for election without prior service, do not have to face.

b) While admittedly there are undertones of bias on the end of nussu with regards to TLSR, the set-up for the EOGM leaves much to be desired. Not only is a smaller group of voters required to pass any given agenda (just 100), the restriction of time and place introduces a potential voter selection bias (proposed holding of EOGM is at the UTown Chua Tian Poh Hall, which is at the USP doorstep) Ultimately, these factors have great potential to reduce the representativeness of the vote for the EOGM agenda. For a team that touted loudly the fairness in democratic processes, exploiting perhaps less-than-thoughtful nussu regulations for an EOGM to bar opposing candidates, while following the letter of nussu law, clearly goes against both the democratic spirit of letting the majority make the decision, and against their own previously implied standards of what democratic elections should be about.

If my interpretation of the EOGM agenda is in any way fallacious, students who were signators to the document (there are 70 of you, after all) are welcome to lay out your explanation. And for the benefit of the student population, in less legal-speak if possible."

52514,"Second year of JC, I cheated on my then-boyfriend with a guy from one of my CCAs.

He'd been ignoring me for a good 2 months, avoiding me and not wanting to meet up on pretext of being busy and needing space and whatnot. He'd blue tick me for days and ignore my messages... and this other guy was a close friend whom I kind of got close to very fast. He was I guess the closest friend I'd ever had. We clicked well despite not being that similar, and he was someone I worked with frequently because he was helping out with the department I headed though he covered a larger scope of work... So I kind of took comfort with him and basically took advantage of him I guess.

We had some action in one of our CCA rooms after wrapping up events most days, but my ex found out and we broke up.

Not saying what I did was right, but I'm learning to forgive myself for it, and it's taken a long time. I didn't dare to date anyone since and I pretty much cut off all my male friends after that incident... And then I found out he'd been cheating on me too which was why he'd been so unresponsive. It still leaves me with a lot of trust issues here. It probably helps that my school will pretty much not exist from next year on so I guess that's one less trigger I have to deal with. :/

I know the saying is once a cheater always a cheater, but honestly, I feel terrible about it and I don't think I could ever do it again. It was an indiscretion I don't think I could ever repeat, but the worst part is that I can't even say that I was drunk or ""not in the right frame of mind"" like the stereotypical ""bad-decision"" in those cheesy drama plots. I can't even find comfort in saying I don't remember it because I do and it sticks with me, every moment of it clear as day, just feeling guilty about all of it.

And to my best friend, I'm sorry we had to end like this. It was really liberating knowing you. It's been over 4 years now but I still feel really bad about using you like that. I know you're in NUS now, so this is probably the only way I can reach out to you. I hope you're doing fine and I hope you find your closure. I'm very sorry.

Maybe one day I'll find mine."

52511,"I have a friend who prefers paying first (no cash, only has big notes, etc) but then 'forgets' how much I owe her & always claims that it's a little more than the actual amount... I feel so stingy correcting her for like a dollar or 50c less but added up it's really quite a lot! it feels too rude to tell her I prefer to pay separately too..."
52509,"#52459: Need a lit/philo major's help here. How ironic is it to write a post calling out a page for being anonymous while hiding behind the shield of anonymity on a confession page?

Bonus qn: How ironic is this post which calls out the above post? Does this lead to a meta-recursive loop of irony? Discuss (but don't post more, please)."

52507,"Econs seniors, how similar is Uni Econs to JC? I loved Jc Econs but many ppl have told me that Uni Econs is very math oriented. Is it very different from JC Econs? I’m gonna take the exposure mod next Sem but just wanna hear your opinions."

52503,"The moment when you find out that all of your coursemates are in a telegram group without you. Yep, that's me, folks. Sigh....

52502,"I know I'm gonna get bashed by saying this but this is something that I really need to talk about. 

Class participation has been very important and a big proportion of our grades depends on it. But, lecturers never understand how difficult is it for introverted students to even speak up. (I know some of you are gonna say how we are just finding excuses for not speaking up, but try being in our shoes, this isn't something that everyone understands. I would love to be in your shoes, to be able to speak my mind freely as and when I like, and easily earn class participation marks.) 

I even got too stressed out about this and decided to look for a school counselor in hopes that he/she will be able to help me out. 

Perhaps NUS could come up with a way - e.g. forum discussions, submitting diaries/journals in place of speaking up in class because myself (and I believe some other NUS students as well) just...can't do it. We are trying our best, even if it's just a line or two. "
52501,"I noticed in some foodcourt stalls that uses the 2 queues system (1 to order, 1 to collect) often have a hard time getting students to collect their food, especially when there is no actual queue for collection and students who ordered just stood scattering around. Some students are so engrossed in using their phones that they miss their collection, requiring the cashier to shout many times on the order before the student realise it. To those students, please try to respect the cashier and pay attention when the cashier shouts the order."
52500,"Last Friday, I was working on a project with a guy friend late into the night and he missed the last bus to go home. Citing that he's staying very far away (ponggol), he didn't want to cab back (cos too X) and instead suggested that maybe he can utilize his lvl 99 ninja skill to crash at my hall. To be very considerate and showing true concern for my reservations upon telling him 'no' the fist time, he went ahead and said that he would allow me to chain his ankle up to something steady far away from where I would be sleeping, so I can be sure nothing weird would be happening untill I wake up to undo the lock. LOL. 

In the end I still said no. Am I being mean and not being considerate of his plight? I would agree that that chain idea would significantly reduce my risks if any, to a near zero, and I actually don't mind that much to be honest. But I'm still feeling kinda funny about the whole idea. What if this happens again?
