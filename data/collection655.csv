65596,"Similar to #65596, I have also rejected many guys due to what I believe is my sexual orientation. Agreed that I shouldnt be wasting their time in leading them to believe there's hope in being more than just mere friends. However, the people around me in school don't seem to suspect it because of my appearance and behaviour, also the fact that I'm surrounded by a good balance of friends with opposite and same gender. When they ask me 'why have not you found a bf yet', I just say I am a picky person and haven't found anyone suitable yet, which is kind of true in a way, all this just to avoid their further questioning."
65595,What is your opinion on staying together before marriage. And how you managed if your parents if they have traditional mindset.
65594,"Hi all, I am the poster of #65459. Thanks all for the advice. Maybe I should give more context on the situation. Like all relationships, we had our fair share of arguments. There was one particularly intense argument where he raised his voice at me when he was clearly in the wrong (it was something math related). After which he explained that the reason he reacted that way was because he felt inferior (due to our different education levels) and wanted to be ""right for once"". We have talked about this and resolved it, just that I can't seem to forget this incident. However, throughout most part of the relationship, he was a super caring boyfriend who watches out for my every need, tries to be accommodating and make handmade gifts for me every now and then. The only concern that I have is his reaction whenever he gets angry or frustrated. He would tend to vent his anger on non living objects, such as punching the wall and breaking his own items etc. When he plays games and loses, he will bang his keyboard in frustration. (I think this is quite common among guys who play games?) I have spoken to him about it (yes, I was concerned of potential violence in the future) but he assured me that he would never hurt me physically and would not even think of it. 

I do see a future with him as I love him a lot and he is really a sweet guy in general. We are even planning for our future together. Is this considered an anger management issue even if it doesn't happen often? Can it be resolved?"

65590,Any seniors from FASS who took other level 4k mods in Y4S1 while doing HT because those mods are only offered in sem 1? What was your experience? Was the workload too heavy? Am I crazy for wanting to do this?
65584,"There is a girl i like. I have had feelings for her for almost 2 years now and I my feelings for her are so strong that I think I'm in love with her. To make things more complicated, she was also my best friend and we were very close. About a month ago i told her that i liked her. I didn't ask her out just told her I liked her. It seemed to catch her off guard. And nothing happened, she didn't really react then, she didn't say she liked me back or anything. Nor did she say she didn't like me.  I assumed she needed time to think about it. 

But since then, it feels like she has been avoiding me. Before this we used to hang out almost everyday day but we haven't met in a while. She won't even reply texts for a long time now. She doesn't seem at all enthusiastic about even meeting me anymore. Is it possible she is avoiding me because she'd rather this whole thing just go away without her having to deal with it?

The reason I took so long to tell her that I liked her was because i feared that if she rejected me i would lose her completely, as a friend and all. I fear now that worst case scenario may have happeneed. 
So what do i do? 

It seems like she doesn't like me but I can't even ask her since she hardly replies texts or answers calls now.  Or could she jsut be very busy. I don't know. From being that close to hardly communicating anymore, it's a big change. 

But even if I do assume the worst, which is that she doesn't like me, how do i move on? How do i even find out how she feels?"
65583,"how do you deal with average looking girl in your clique, who looks jealous every time a  guy gives you attention instead of her, and the girl just publicly puts you down out of jealousy? How do you also deal with a sour guy friend in your clique, who suffered rejection from other pretty girls, and keeps lashing on you indirectly in group conversation. the reason for his behaviour is: you also turned him down before?"
65582,"She is 5/6 years older and definitely way more ahead in her life, but she doesn’t flaunts it. She’s independent, She’s much chattier than I am, and I definitely like that I won’t be bored with her. Question is, how do I know if I’m not just one of the fishes in the pond?"
65581,"re: #65513, I'm quite curious after reading the response. Prof Ben, would you be willing to share how you became jaded about the civil service? From your description, it sounded like a very meaningful experience once one is willing to be a realist about what the civil service is."
65578,"I've been with my gf for about 3 years. But last semester I met another girl whom I can click very easily with. We've been spending a lot of time together going for meals and studying, and have lots of similar interests. I found out we even have the same views on career and even family.

Meanwhile, I feel that I don't love my gf as much anymore. I still love her, but not as much, possibly due to this new girl. To make matters worse, we've argued a few times in the past over when/where/how to settle down as we have very different views. So far we've been sweeping these problems under the rug and avoided discussing it (since we're still in uni and don't have to address them so urgently), as though believing the other person will eventually compromise and we will get our own way. Other than that, the relationship has been stable and we are still happy (I'm less happy about the rship now than in the past, but not really that upset over it) together. It's just these issues about family planning that may be a pain to deal with when we do settle down post-uni.

I don't know what I should do. The grass seems a lot greener on the other side, but I don't want to have wasted my 3 years with my gf, and I feel bad if I leave her for another girl. But at the same time I don't know if we'll ever be able to overcome those disagreements. Please help me."
65577,"Does anyone know of any club in NUS that teaches some kind of magic tricks, occult arts or psychology related? I'm into that kind of things, but can't find any CCAs like that in NUS."
65574,"People always say that in a relationship there’ll be one who loves the other more. I feel like my bf loves me more than I love him and I feel really guilty about it. Don’t get me wrong, I do love him and see myself marrying him eventually but is it wrong of me to also feel kind of relieved that he loves me more?"
65571,"I've decided I'm going to transfer out of my course.

For the longest time, all I've ever cared about is what other people thought. I always made my decisions based on conventional notions of ""prestige"" and ""success"", because all I've ever craved was acknowledgment and respect. I thought that was the solution to happiness.

It honestly was for a period of time. But now, it's not. 

I'm in a course with a pretty high starting pay. I got average grades after nearly driving myself insane from studying, and was fortunate enough to land a brief internship, but the fact of the matter is, I absolutely despise what I'm doing. It doesn't interest me the way it interests my friends, and I am almost certain I want nothing to do with my course the moment I graduate. And the more time I spend here, the more drained and fatalistic I become. 

Don't get me wrong. I understand that I should be grateful for the opportunities I've been given. I understand that I ""should be happy"" and that my ""stars (appear to) align"". But there's a clear demarcation between society and the individual, and what ""is"" and what ""should be"". I'm sick and tired of living someone else's dream, instead of figuring out my own.

I just want to be decently happy, I guess. And staying here just ain't gonna cut it. No matter what my friends or family say.

65570,"Hi guys *DISCLAIMER* EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL (and perhaps philosophical) POST ABOUT BODY TYPES AHEAD. IF YOU ARE THE SENSITIVE TYPE, PLEASE SKIP THIS POST. ALL CHARACTERISITCS MENTIONED IN THIS POST IS NOT MEANT TO TARGET ANYONE.

(1): So I have this idea that 'beauty is the eye of the beholder' is hardwired into us humans in our DNA as part of evolution. I clarify that said beauty may not solely be physical beauty, but can be other forms of attraction such as personality, knowledge or even money. I.E. If I love u and u love me, we make one big family. 

(2): There is a general consensus of beauty in this world. It may vary geographically and historically, but they exist. Not everybody value traits of 'beauty' equally, but many people share similar preferences such as Thin / Buff>Fat; Larger>Smaller sexual part, kind>nasty, rich> poor

*WARNING* IF U FEEL INSULTED ALREADY, SKIP THIS POST NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. 
(3): If (1) and (2) are true, then people who fall out from the general consensus of beauty are as if they are disadvantaged from procreation (unless they have other redeeming features, or they happen to meet a variant who love them for who they are)

(4): If (3), then why are we (maybe not Singapore, but the world in general) promoting plus-size models & encouraging fat-acceptance? I understand that many of them are bullied, and I understand that we should not condone such bullying. But at the same time, I feel that we should be encouraging these people to be more proactive in working out (not excessively of course) for beauty and health reasons rather than telling them it’s alright to be fat (because it’s not unless you don’t mind the health problems and the lack of partners who accept you for who you are, i.e. don’t go around b*tching about the problems you face)

DISCLAIMER AGAIN: This post is not meant to insult anybody, but to fulfil my curiosity regarding this area. If you feel insulted, I am sorry, but know that I have no intention to insult you."
65569,"Hi. Is not going for SEP (for any reason at all) very common? What are some things you miss out on if you don't go for exchange? (Other than the common ones like travelling and studying abroad)

Has anyone not gone for exchange because their academic plan doesn't allow them to? (E.g reading Double Major/Double Minor and cannot map enough mods on exchange to graduate on time) Did you consider dropping your second Major/Minor in that case?"
65568,"Am i weird if i fantasized about my wife' sister? She is in her early twenties and i have seen her grown up since her secondary days. Over the years, she has developed into a pretty teenager and i have been ogling at her (obviously without anyone knowing). i know this is inappropriate and i should not have this thought. But every family gathering when i see her, my mind will start to wander and think of her. What should i do?"
65566,"So I just met a new guy online a few months ago, taking a leap of faith and going into the dating scene again after recovering from a tough breakup. We hit it off very well and he was very sweet and nice. However, the past few days his replies has been curt and he sounds uninterested. Should I ask him what's wrong?"
65565,"Have been with my boyfriend for some time and my parents were aware of it. However, through some interactions with my parents, they actually dislike him and hope for our break up. To me, what they have mentioned are small matters cause my bf was shy and nervous in front of them. Recently we are planning for BTOs and our future and I hinted my parents on the move. They got frustrated and really upset. I sincerely hope for some advice here. 
My parents dote me very much and I do not want to disappoint them. However, my bf has been great to me so far and I am not sure if things will go well with others. 
Thanks in advance!"

65559,Hey guys! Just wondering about the kinds of questions to expect when you go for a job interview/ what kinds of questions have you guys have been asked before? Thought this would be a good platform to share and learn from each other.
65557,"Do people actually ""date"" before officially being in a relationship? How long does this ""dating phase"" last? What's the difference between dating and being in a relationship? If you fall for another person during dating does this count as cheating? I have friends who have dated for more than 3 months, they have gone to like 2nd 3rd base already but they insist that they are just dating and not bf/gf. I don't understand how this works."
65555,"I have an amazing gf right now (smart, pretty, rich, have nice body, treats me really well). However my love for her is not that strong and sometimes I don’t feel happy with her. I was happier with my ex (I really loved her, she treats me really well, but average in other areas). 

My friends are envious of me and I think I’m lucky to be with my gf too. Should I be satisfied with my gf or should I find a new gf who I truly love and can be happy with? I think I will have a hard time finding a new gf because of the high standards already set by my gf and ex and it’s very hard to find someone who’s better."

I felt your story was quite similar to mine, and I totally agree with your message never be too trusting with others.

I did look for guys for some action during my NS days, probably in what I felt was a way to cope with a sense of despondency and hopelessness, as I didn't have friends or others to count on during that period. I never knew that some were taking pictures only after encounters, but thankfully there was never any of those with my face. This was even when I explicitly requested for no pictures.

Thankfully, at that stage I found new purpose in a new hobby and my social life improved so I never found the need to engage in such activities after that, but to this day I can't believe I was that naive back then and I really regret my decisions. I wish I had the courage to seek help, but I never wanted to show that side of me to anyone, afraid that the few friends and acquaintances I had would leave me and that a record of depression would leave a black mark which could haunt me for life. 

I'm happy to say that this is mostly behind me, I never came out and I've been able to live a normal undergrad life for now. But on some nights I get up in tears, questioning why I made those decisions.

Always err on the side of caution, and don't let others guilt trip you into anything. People respect you more when you stand your ground than if you're a pushover."
65552,"A group of us were hired for position A, but only I was told to do work for positions B, C, etc. Should I feel happy?"
65547,"Hey all. I'm a pretty well adjusted person generally, but I always have this tendency to make a few people feel bad about themselves, very often unwittingly. They tend to lash out / Paggro at me in some way, oftentimes emotionally. I'm not sure in what way I do this, behavior-wise, because I can't 'see' myself in third person a lot of the time (im sure most people dont do this 24/7). I have good thoughts about people, and I don't judge people in my head when I talk to them, but I tend to speak my mind sometimes, which I think will make people think about it later on in other situations, which will trigger them to feel a bit bad (maybe I do tease people a bit, but really, it's not because i'm an asshole), maybe later on. I admit that I am a little bit not too talkative in social situations, maybe  that could be why; or people are just stressed then they think of me poking a bit of fun at them and so they think i can be a human pin cushion for their lashing (???). This doesn't happen too often, but I don't want to be a people pleaser as well. Any thoughts; am i overthinking or someone faced this before?"
65544,"Warning: Long post ahead...

To #65544 and to anyone else who might be in a similar situation. Don't give up, I know how you feel. Looking at your confession reminds me of what I went through some years back. Just like you, it felt like I haven't been able to meet everyone's expectations (my family, friends, and even myself). To make things worse my brother is the textbook definition of an overachiever. In a sense he was my benchmark for what a successful person looks like.

Throughout the years, it felt like all the things that I had been doing was to please my family and friends but the sad truth is that i've never enjoyed all of those things I did. Even when I selected my course of study in uni, it was to please my father. I absolutely hated what I was studying and my results were hopeless. Then it finally got to a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I was absolutely miserable and depressed with my life and I finally decided that this is not the way I want to go forward. I took the ""drastic"" decision to drop out of my course without consulting my parents (not adviceable. On hindsight i felt that it would be much better if i had consulted with them first). When they realised what I had done, they thought I was crazy and I can see that they were disappointed with me again. In fact, I cannot and will never forget that look of disappointment on my dad's  face. My close friends thought I was being impulsive and stupid.

After much persuasion and a lot of tears, I finally managed to convince my family that my choice isn't such a bad one (not sure if they were truly convinced with my reasoning but I choose to believe they were). As my results were too poor, NUS didn't allow me to switch to a course of my choice but thankfully my parents became more supportive of me and were willing to send me abroad to pursue my undergraduate studies (something that I am extremely grateful for).

Fast forward to the present, I have since graduated and am working in an MNC drawing a considerable salary. I dare say that I am in a better position than if I were to continue with my original course of study in NUS. My relationship with my family has also improved significantly and we are much closer than before.

TL;DR: Please don't give up and don't let past disappointments dictate your future. Don't live your life according to others' expectation. You know yourself best and you are much better than what you think you are so focus on the things that you like and the things that you're good at. I'm sure things will get much better in future!"
65543,"Had a guy friend with whom i was closed to for almost 2 years. Trusted his lies and fake promises about how much my friendship meant to him. We were going happily and smoothly being such good friends. Till we were occupied for a period of 2 months. We didnt contact each other with our busy schedule. Since it was unlikely of him not to communicate with me i tried reaching out to him messaging, calling him not a single reply returned. Turned out he found himself a new girlfriend and then this friend is nolonger needed ? So what can we do to this sort of people who barely have integrity to tell before leaving or betray ones trust by giving false hopes that they are true friends and that they would never leave??? How many of you people have got betrayed by your close friends too ?? Once your benefits ends u leave do we female seem like a materialistic rack?"
65541,"i've been spending time alone by myself for this long break. it's not too bad, i found myself a job. Rest of the time, i'm spending time alone doing alone things - exercise, doing online courses, watching shows. it's not bad.

part of me still feels lonely. i only have a few close friends whom i'm comfortable with, and i truly only feel comfortable when i'm with them, but most of the time we are away.

yet, im actually afraid of talking to people or be inside a big group of people. i would love to be exposed to people, i've found it hard to be closer

it's ironic, i dislike being alone yet i'm scared of people. even i myself am lost. i am scared of returning for the semester, to be by myself and seeing people with friends. i've quit using social media so i would be better with my emotions.

65522,"Hey, so I'm a Y2 Science major and basically I've been having troubles within my relationship recently. I have been dating my girlfriend since we were about 13-14 and before everything was good and we would listen and respect each other.
However, since she started University she has gotten this idea that I am ""controlling"" and ""manipulative' just because I tell her she cannot wear short skirt or low cut top in public, and because she is not allowed to have male friends who are better looking than me. And when I went to meet with her for lunch I found her wearing a shorter than thigh length skirt and when we talked she showed me some of her friends and one of the guys Is an 8/10 and about 5ft10 when I am probably a 7/10 and only 5ft8.

So why is she disrespecting all of the rules that we put in place to make sure the relationship runs smoothly? I think it is because she has been hanging around with more liberal people since joining a RC. So how can I get her to forget these liberal ideas and go back to the way we always were?"

When we play co-op shooters, we generally have fun, but sometimes I make a stupid mistake or miss something very obvious and try to laugh it off, but my boyfriend says that it makes him feel disconnected from me. It's become a genuine point of depression for him. 

We've tried talking about it and I don't think there is an underlying problem, because we mostly have good communication elsewhere. There are times where I am slow to the uptake, but I am working hard to try and limit that. I know I struggle with keeping up sometimes, but he is generally very patient with me and teaches me things. I think when we play games he just wants to have a good time, and reaches his limit with me. 

I don't know how to make this better. Should we just move on to different types of games, do something else? I want to improve myself but I don't know how. He does a lot for me, and the fact that I ruin this time we spend together makes me feel very guilty."
