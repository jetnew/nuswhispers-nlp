I usually notice these people tend to have children who have learning disabilities and probably are doing it for me in hopes that someone's else will do it for their child too.

In response to #57696
I'm trying to understand your pov. If the author is a woman, stop over-generalizing the female population. Some are perfectly capable of doing your idea of 'compartmentalizing' - which according to you, refer to 'separate their feelings from sexual needs'. Women do have sexual needs too, sex is not just for procreation or as a gift to a man in return for the love between them. It just so happens that women do tend to be able to be more selective about their sexual partners, which may explain your illusion that males 'need to get into a woman’s head before you get into her bed'. 

If you are a male, I can see why you are doing this relative comparison. But please do not degrade the entire male population and reducing them to shells who simply act on their animal instincts. Love encompasses everything, including and most importantly respect for the other party. Personally, I do have a problem with your idea of love that a man has for a woman, because it seems as if the 'love' is limited to sexual attraction and seeing the other party as an ideal mate to value-add to his family life. 

Do unto others what you would have them do unto you. This applies to cheating as well. If you take the view that cheating is fatal to a relationship, do away with the male vs female distinction and do not compare like with like with the effect of forcing a difference on something that is in substance, the same. 

These are just my personal views and you are most welcomed to disagree.

57694,"I am a quiet girl. I don’t have much friends because majority of them. I just can’t trust them. I was betrayed after I told a small secret to one of my friend. And after I opened up and told another secret to another person, the exact same thing happened again. I have only a few trustworthy friends and majority of them are guys. After getting betrayed for more than 2 times, I end up not trusting my classmates. So end up, I become alone during group discussions because I don’t mind doing it myself. I can trust myself but I really couldn’t trust anyone else out there. I am the person that wrote confession #57694. I was so speechless when I was thinking about everything that’s happening in my life. I felt very unfair and I constantly ask myself why do I look this way and not like ordinary girls. I always stay at home during the weekends because I don’t feel like going out. I was thinking how people will look at me when I’m alone. I don’t like the way they look at me. I feel that the people in my class can only be considered fake friends. Fake friends can’t be real friends right? Fake friends is always fake. So I end up becoming a big loner myself. Sometimes it’s not really that I can’t trust them. It’s just that their actions and whatever they tell me makes me can’t trust them. Everyone say I’m a loner. And I believe I am one. I hated being alone, but there was nothing else I could do. Being friendly to them make them take advantage of me. So I end up just kept quiet because I don’t want myself to be the gossip of the day. I hated people gossiping about me and no matter where I go, I am always the topic of the day. For every small little action that I do, it end up become a big gossip. And I’m so afraid that I don’t dare to tell my mom about it. And end up I kept it with myself. Though she knows about the cyberbullying shit but she does not know what’s happening at the back. And sometimes I really wonder one thing. Is she really my mom? Like she keeps comparing me to my sister and even the way I look will cause her to give comments like how come you so fat? Even my auntie and uncles will pamper my younger sister and buy her dresses and clothes and other stuff that fits my sister well. And my auntie will always give comments like you really should lose some weight or next time don’t have bf then you know. I just dislike it. I hated myself because of that. I have ever thought of killing myself and I know killing myself wont solve the issue at all. Can someone help me or tell me what should I do? I really want to help myself, cos I couldn’t take it anymore."

1) Don't be discouraged. I am a CS graduate and I suck at maths too. I used to take weeks to study for maths intensive papers (e.g. CS1231, CS3230) compared to a day for non-maths intensive CS papers (e.g. CS2106, CS4212). I played with Linux all my life, so I understood OS, compilers, it is so logical, but I didn't understand how CS1231 could make things so complicated. Hahaha XD

I think you and I are the same kind of people. We love practical hands-on stuff. To build kickass shit. Well, you can build kickass shit without lots of complex maths. We hire maths people for those parts. We understand computers, but we don't understand maths.

3) While what Prof Ben Leong said in the comments, CS is Applied Maths is kinda true. That's also kinda an overgeneralized statement. CS is not all about maths. It is about 0s and 1s and how those 0s and 1s can be used to improve lives.

Be humble, keep working hard. Even if you suck at maths, just try your best to pass the modules for now. Don't know, just ask your friendly neighbourhood professors, they are really nice.

4) Never forget what is your purpose for studying CS? To get a better paying job? Because you enjoy coding? Or because you like maths?

If it is to get a better paying job, the concepts of scalability, reliability, access controls, software lifecycle, software architecture and design, technical debt, technology risk management, version control, is far more important than any complex maths you use CS. I recommend you to take software engineering, information security, practise your coding skills and learn to communicate core CS concepts in layman terms. These things add far more value to your future employer than any maths skills that you may have.

I have seen many people who have great maths skills, but in the end, they can't speak, they can't communicate, heck, they can't even speak in proper sentences. Don't be an alien like them. Be a team player, be the bridge between business executives and the tech team. Be project manager, CTO, team lead, those roles get paid more too.

5) And if your purpose is because you enjoy coding, just code on the side, in addition to mugging out those maths stuff. Try out new software like Docker, Vagrant, try compiling Gentoo, haha good luck with that man, try reverse engineering software, try to automate your life, try Beets to sort your music collection, try to write your own TrueCrypt software, maybe make some Android games. Those things are hella fun to do and keeps you sane. And these things are skills that might be useful in the future.

6) If your purpose is because you like maths, then well, take a PhD, or do research, I guess.

Haha, have fun coding! =)"
57686,"I have been happily attached for close to 4 years. During the first 2 years of the relationship, we did not have any sex because my girlfriend wanted to lose it to someone she thought she would marry. I have a high sex-drive and I was able to abstain sex and waited for her consensus. 2 years into the relationship we did it (it was both our first).

Here comes the problem. I have a high sex drive, but she doesn't. We only do it twice a month or even once a month. This few months has been intolerable for me. I feel like visiting FL just to do the deed (no strings attached of course).

I do not know why I am becoming intolerable of the lack of sex in our relationship. My girlfriend went for exchange in the last AY while I stayed in SG and I was totally fine with it. I even managed to fend off some advances some girls had on me (from hall and camps), and remained faithful to my girlfriend.

So the question now is, should I?"

Contacting jc friends prevents you from “moving on” and transitioning into nus univeristy life!!! “ has anyone said that?

 No. 

Why should we “move on” from previous relationships when a new one has formed? I will never forget my old friends in jc when I settle down in nus, and I don’t see how that’s being “unfair” to friends in nus? 

People also say “staying friends prolongs the pain of separation”. Separation happens in many ways, including graduation where I had to part with my closest friends from jc. 
How does cutting ties with my former friends from my previous school “prolong the pain of separation “? 

When school ends after graduation,I never cut off contact with my friends. I don’t believe staying friends with my jc mates prevents me from making more friends in nus and neither will this disrespect my new friends.

In fact, it is more about standing out among your peers or your colleagues that get you the recognition. It is not like as though coming from a JC or from a poly will ensure you will be able to get a good job, get married or even get your CPF earlier than the rest... 

And trust me, when you are so done with your work, you wouldn't even have the time to get triggered over the JC and Poly comparison.

I know there has been the initiative of an NUS lost and found telegram group but it might not be accessible to everyone (for instance, those who don't use Telegram, or those who do but are unaware of the existence of this potentially life-saving resource - they could be the finders and/or the ones who misplaced their items).

**But I have a concern regarding directly emailing the owner of the misplaced item though. In doing so, would we be violating the PDPA (which OSA is so uptight about these few years)?

On a side note, I think the NUS lost-and-found telegram group, as of now, might not seem to be very effective, since it is kind of new (it has  only established since the start of Sem 1 of this AY18/19 if I'm not wrong) as compared to NTU and SMU's support groups which started out earlier and has greater access to the student community (not sure if it's because their students have a greater tendency to misplace their stuff or the campus is quite big or both).

But in any case, really kudos to the admins (of not only NUS' group but also those of the other local universities' support groups) who started this community initiative to help out your fellow schoolmates (or even staff) who misplace their stuff around campus (or on the MRT near our campuses)!

57645,"Yesterday was my birthday. My friends booked the SRC when they decided to gather to have a friendly badminton game. I was so excited thinking that they would be celebrating for me! As I was imagining...perhaps the sports hall is going to be filled with so many balloons, it would be decorated as if there is a party going on. There was multiple bouquets of flowers and other colourful assorted things.

The huge suprising factor was that my buddies had purchased a pair of colorvision correcting specs for me, as I am apparently colorblind. All of them took out their flashy handphones and started taking photos and videos and posted on the social media. They told me to put the glasses on and at that moment I was damn excited, my heart was beating so fast as I was about to see the colours in life that I had been missing for 20 years. 

My boyfriend appeared out of nowhere to put on the specs for me but...absolutely nothing. Everything was still black and white. But at this point I can't disappoint them, as the specs are so expensive and that they have taken so much effort to get them for me and decorated the hall with colourful balloons and gave me so many bouquets of flowers. I have cannot put them down.

I told myself to summon all my acting and lying skills. I became dramatic and started thinking of all the sad moments in tragic movies I love, Inside Out and More than Blue. My boyfriend is dying from the last stage of cancer, I have no idea how many stages are there in total, but I need advice. I started for the second time to cry so badly my hands were trembling. I forced myself to start crying for the third time I have mentioned this and I was so surprised to be able to see colours.

Actually the glasses didn't work and at this point of time, if you are still reading this you would have realised that I am seeking for your advice for something that I myself am unsure what is it about. I carried on writing about it but I don't even dare to tell anyone because I am afraid that people will realise that this doesn't mean anything at all.

I wasn't even a ""high achiever"": I was always that kid who, if put in a better class, I tank the bottom positions, and if put in an average class, I do just fine. So maybe I had some expectations, but not enough for me to feel like I'm suddenly dumb (basically, I always felt like I am, but not to this extent).

But I somehow am here today, feeling so stupid and so dumb all the time, because everybody else seems to know what they're doing, what they're talking about, what the deeper issues of things are. 

I feel like I lack every single thing that a final year uni student should have, and it's depressing me a little because it's not like I haven't tried - tried to do my homework, tried to read up on things, tried to research for myself things that I don't understand, tried to ask questions (except, because I don't know what I don't know, I often just stare blankly at everyone else in class). 

I feel so stupid and it's depressing. If I double down on my efforts, will I get better? Will I somehow be brighter, more critical, much smarter? Will I somehow ask the RIGHT questions, say the RIGHT keywords, make the RIGHT point that is good and intelligent?

I know I'm just a small fish in a very, very big lake, among the best and the brightest. And I appreciate that I have some place, even if it's absolutely minuscule, among them.

You know if you really loved that part of CS I think that's great! Seems like a rare breed these days if you ask me.

These are really options you can look at if you really want to go back to that kind of life. Well depending on the field you're interested in, either option would be more viable than the other.

57635,"#57602: There is usually an ""official"" version of a story, to be taken at face value; your thesis is basically that version, and so is the entire field of international relation, which are mostly the official and ceremonial part of strategy.

First, mentioning the absence of evidence of Huawei ""spying"" is both technically correct and naive. Everybody who knows a tiny bit about espionage knows that every embassy and consulate are filled with spies. Probably a quarter to half the staff. This is a perfect cover: legitimate job and diplomatic immunity. Everybody knows this and nobody is ""that"" serious about rooting out the spies. It's a quid-pro-quo: if you try to kick out all the spies of a particular country, that country can also kick out yours and your embassy and you become practically blind, deaf, and dumb. This explains the practice of expelling foreign diplomats during tense moments.

Second, technological firms are spying and collecting data? What else is new? Water is wet? Of course they do this. The big problem with spying is not whether someone is doing it or not, but rather whether they do it can get caught.

Third, while you are accurate that this, like expelling diplomats, or Frau Angela Merkel complaining about the NSA wiretapping German citizens, a political move; it is an extension of geostrategic competition. Once upon a time, we competed by killing each other on the battlefield. Ever since the end of WWII, geostrategic competition has been surprisingly and relatively bloodless. Sure, there are the occasional war; but consider that fewer Americans died in the longest war in American history than half a day on the beaches of Normandy, that is some impressive progress. Half of American war deaths were from one 19th century war (the Civil War).

Poly is a sheltered environment. Ever heard of peer evaluation or cry to mummy (aka lecturer)? Good chance to pull down the grades of those freeloaders you hate.

There are students who could find diligent students with different strengths to form a group. Don't blame on group work if you don't attract the hardworking/strong in group work students to work with you and end up in a group of leftovers. Your social circle small don't blame on luck la.

Internships. Welcome to the REAL world where there are no clear indicators like A/A+ to tell you where you stand in the organisation. Oh and don't say senior never tell you. Real world got more freeloaders than you think. You're welcome.

57625,"Would you retaliate a bully from primary school if you see him at NUS? I don't know whether I'm weak or ""mature"", I just can't forgive, but I see no point in being rude since I'm already in university...

to forgive is kind.
I'm unkind: I can forgive all but myself,
for retaliation is the justice I've declined."
57624,"In response to #57624, hey! Sort of someone in CS with similar sentiments. Not sure if you'll find what I have to say useful. Still currently undergoing my degree as well. Won't say which year or whether ddp and all that if that's okay.
You know if you really loved that part of CS I think that's great! Seems like a rare breed these days if you ask me. I'm not sure if you've considered it but perhaps try for a post graduate and stay in academia? Either that or find a company with an rnd department you could stay in? These are really options you can look at if you really want to go back to that kind of life. Well depending on the field you're interested in, either option would be more viable than the other. 

Don't give up hope! Just because people think CS kids only become software engineers doesn't mean it's really true! There definitely are people who work on cool cool stuff and don't do software engineering. I'm sure you gotta do a little looking around and digging though. 

Even places like microsoft and yadda yadda have rnd labs that can do quite theoretical stuff algorithmically and so on. And well I hope you're not into AI but if you are it's all the rage these days, I'm sure you can find a place that would be willing to take in someone as mathematically inclined as you are. 

Either way whatever you decide good luck!

Someone who's gonna fail at being a software engineer"
57623,"Once, I saw this female classmate doing tutorial, so I approached her and asked if she needed my help. She shouted, ""Go away la!"". 

I was just try to help. I would help anyone regardless of whether they were male or female.

After that incident, she posted on her Facebook and told everyone to delete me for disturbing her, then several people actually did so.

The only reason she has supporter is due to her beauty which is inversely proportionate to her character.

What should be my next step? Live my life and be glad that my Facebook friend list did an automatic ""spring cleaning"" or beg the female classmate to stop telling people to delete me by promising to give in to any threat that she ever wishes for?

57605,"@#57605: I really need to clarify.

I'm a poly student here and I keep hearing this common notion by JC students thinking poly students are the 'cream of the crop'. Every time people find out I'm from poly, they'll be like 'wah, so smart ah. Top student of cohort ah.'

No, this isn't always true. It's a huge misconception. Actually most of the time, it isn't and is the opposite. The problem with polytechnic graduates is that their GPAs are graded very differently depending on polytechnics, depending on lecturers' bias, groupwork luck, internships, alot more things than just pure grades. Did I mention groupwork? Seriously, groupwork.

Let's start with the biggest factor. Groupwork. By far the most unfair and senseless grading component that academia has come up with, it can easily toss up the GPA of the undeserving students like freeloaders who end up in a group of smark alecks and pull down the GPA of smark alecks who end up in a group of freeloaders.  I'm sorry, but groupwork is utter BS. Ask ANY poly student, ANY. I guarantee you most of them will tell you the same thing. Groupwork is utter BS.
It's extremely unfair and can completely turn upside down your GPA depending on who you get. During my time in poly, I've seen students just free-riding up up A grades in group project even when they hardly did anything.  I myself had to carry useless group members plenty of times just so they don't drag my GPA down. At least it's not as infuriating in uni since everyone here is more grades-obsessed. 

Another thing. Internship. The poly I come from takes internship grades as part of your GPA so if you end up with a s***ty company with a super strict supervisor, you can kiss goodbye to your GPA or try to kiss your supervisor's butt as much as possible. Meanwhile if you end up in some company with a lax supervisor or know how to rub shoulders, you can be sure to get instant A+. An A+ for one whole semester is a HUGE raise in GPA. Tell me how's that fair at all. 


And lastly, lecturers. If you LUCKY to get some lecturer who's really lenient and give everyone A grades for group projects, then your GPA will shoot up. Vice versa.


Notice how it's all friggin' luck?


The world isn't fair and polytechnic is by far the biggest example of reflecting just that. It's not like JCs where everyone has to sit for the same A levels, marked under the same criteria, competing under the same bellcurve. 
In poly, there's so many unfair factors all over the place. Kinda like university, right? 


My class had alot of poly students by batch arrangement and there's some of these students still acting so blur or slack it makes you wonder how they even ended up in NUS.  HOW?

Now you know how. "

57602,"#57602: There is usually an ""official"" version of a story, to be taken at face value; your thesis is basically that version, and so is the entire field of international relation, which are mostly the official and ceremonial part of strategy.

First, mentioning the absence of evidence of Huawei ""spying"" is both technically correct and naive. Everybody who knows a tiny bit about espionage knows that every embassy and consulate are filled with spies. Probably a quarter to half the staff. This is a perfect cover: legitimate job and diplomatic immunity. Everybody knows this and nobody is ""that"" serious about rooting out the spies. It's a quid-pro-quo: if you try to kick out all the spies of a particular country, that country can also kick out yours and your embassy and you become practically blind, deaf, and dumb. This explains the practice of expelling foreign diplomats during tense moments.

Second, technological firms are spying and collecting data? What else is new? Water is wet? Of course they do this. The big problem with spying is not whether someone is doing it or not, but rather whether they do it can get caught.

Third, while you are accurate that this, like expelling diplomats, or Frau Angela Merkel complaining about the NSA wiretapping German citizens, a political move; it is an extension of geostrategic competition. Once upon a time, we competed by killing each other on the battlefield. Ever since the end of WWII, geostrategic competition has been surprisingly and relatively bloodless. Sure, there are the occasional war; but consider that fewer Americans died in the longest war in American history than half a day on the beaches of Normandy, that is some impressive progress. Half of American war deaths were from one 19th century war (the Civil War).

This round of geoeconomic conflict is just a tiny bit inconvenient. No one is dying. Don't get your panties in a twist "
