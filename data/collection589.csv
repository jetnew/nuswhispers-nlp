58999,"Hey OP of #58999, I am in the exact same situation as you just that I'm 26 this year and my relationship is in its 6th year (and no, we're not planning to get married so soon). Even until now, my mom still frowns upon me if I hang out at my bf's place for an entire day. She still thinks that it's ""not nice"" and doesn't reflect well on my upbringing, which I find really ridiculous. My parents have always been against stayovers. I wasn't even allowed to stay over at my girl friend's place. On the other hand, my bf has always wanted his gf to have stayovers at his place, but I keep turning down his requests because I am personally uncomfortable with the idea (I have stayed over a couple of times though just to appease him). However, we have gone on overseas trips as a couple and I simply lie to my parents that I'm going with my bf and a bunch of friends lol. My parents would always ask for the contacts of the ""friends"" I'm going with and each time I give them the numbers of a couple of real friends who know my situation. What they don't know won't kill them. I know it's not a good thing to lie but I also know that sometimes, it's really hard to talk to parents about these issues. So if you find it difficult to open up to them, there's always a way to get what you want. Ultimately, parents will have an inkling of what their children are up to. It's just whether or not they want to probe into it. :)"
58998,"So begins the series of girls to avoid when considering a marriage or an LTR. 

This is going to trigger so many people. 

I’ll just want to preface it by saying, this is advice for guys. It’s raw advice. It’s not going to be PC. This is not a safe space for your fewlings.

If you disagree, refute with reason. Please don’t reeeeeeeee about it. It reflects badly on you and nobody benefits. 

Feel free to do a similar column for women. Everyone can compare notes and all can benefit. 

If you’re a guy and you want to get married ask yourself why. 

If you think it’s so that you can lock in the girl, then you obviously don’t know about no fault divorce. The girl can leave if she wants to and modern society and the courts have made it easier and even appealing to do so. 

If your do it for bto then I would ask you if a subsidised apartment is worth your freedom and your peace of mind. If it is, then go ahead. 

If you do it for religious reasons, I want you to have a good look at your religious text again. All the major religions do not specifically say that you should (as a man) get married. In fact, Jesus was celibate. Buddha left his wife and unborn child to seek enlightenment. They are more concerned about you being a good person than whether you got married or not. 

If you do it because your gf is getting older and she’s pressuring you. Then I would tell you to think why she’s in such a rush to get married. Marriage is insurance for women. Where you both pay the premiums and the payout is you. I would also advice you to get your balls back. 

The only reason I can think of is if you want your own biological children. Even that is fraud with danger as you can see with that paternity fraud confession earlier and the follow up attitudes. The kids, in the event of a separation, will usually go to your wife. So you have to be very careful about picking the mother of your kids. 

Which will be the point of this series. 

I’ve written too much now, we will begin next post. "

58992,"For about a decade now I have a rare condition that is called “Chronic pain” and mine has been described as particularly unfortunate, which I guess is just another way of saying bad. To put it simply, I experience pain which has no real cause. 

It started back when I was a teenager and it affects parts of my body randomly. Sometimes it’s just a light touch, other times I can’t even see straight. Prior to all of this for a decade I been doing martial arts and the suspicion is that something went wrong. Ironically due to the same martial arts I was actually quite accustomed to pain so I never really made a big mess out of it. The specialist that observed me even said that they are amazed by how well I tolerate pain.

I’m actually doing really well in my day to day life, I learned to hide in plain sight. I never tell anyone about it, I don’t want pity and frankly it mentally destroys people around you. Medicine doesn’t help either, it’s not like I haven’t tried, it’s just that after years of treatments I feel like there is nothing left to add.  

But there are times when pain overwhelms me. When I sit in the corner of my room unable to move, nights when I can’t sleep or mornings when I wake up completely wet from sweat. After moments like that, when pain shatters my mind, I often sit down in a shower and just wait until I am able to put myself back together. Although probably the most annoying part is when my legs start to hurt badly in public. Then I have to sit somewhere like an idiot being unable to walk and pretend that I’m just passing time. 

I’m probably writing this since another one of my relationships broke down and I’m feeling down about it. It was the same problem as usual – I’m insensitive. And I am, it’s just that from my perspective all these problems most people have seem so insignificant. Also, recently one of my exes, we remained friends, managed to stumble on me “passing time” virtually next to my apartment doors. She didn’t even ask what’s wrong, just sat there silently with me...

Nothing makes sense anymore and I’m feeling scared about it. I honestly don’t know how much more I can cope with this. It is so much harder than I thought it would be. "

58985,"I'm confused about what to do with my girlfriend. No it's not a conflict between us.

Basically her mum was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and would need chemotherapy; although it would merely prolong her mother's life and not a full cure; i.e running out of time. Understandably, my girlfriend has been sad/worried. I check in with her everyday (like usual), and offered to help her in various ways (i.e. buying her food, sending her notes for the modules we take together).

She recently told me via text that she needed some space. I understood that, but I asked if it was alright if I could visit her once a week at the hospital (she was fine with that), and let her be for the rest of the week. However, I felt in these three weeks that I've visited her, she appeared to actually want my company/need me to be around, for example hugging me tightly and not wanting me to leave.

I'm confused as whether I should continue to respect the space she asked for, or try and ""put in more effort"". I did ask her a few days ago if she wanted me to come by her house or the hospital more often, but she ignored that part (she only replies about that day of the week when I'm coming)

"
58979,"Reply to Confession #58979

If you and your partner are roughly of the same age and earning the same income. I feel that it is a much better decision to make it fair 50:50 rather than getting the Male to pay more just because of social hierarchy. This is because your relationship will be a long term one and starting 'unfair' might become a source of conflict in the future which is something that you definitely want to avoid. But to be fair, I do not know of your situation and I do acknowledge some of the situation that might be alright to split 70:30 or 60:40.

1. Ask yourself this question, what are you going to use the rest of the money for when your partner pay more for the 'bigger items'? If it's personal items, assuming that male and female has the same basic necessities, aren't you just being unfair to him?
If you're using it under circumstances such as dental treatment, funding your little brother's school, etc (case on case basis) then you might want to talk to your partner to a certain agreement, but do be honest and remember that not all reason are actually 'valid'. Example is if you say you are funding your parents vacation, he also have parents and the arrangement will become unfair to his parents. So... the point is, really think through what are you going to use the rest of the money for before bringing this up to an 'unbalanced' arrangement.

2. What's the dynamic of your 'smaller items' payment? If it's all based on 50:50, I don't see why you should push the bigger items to other ratio. But if you have the tendency to pay for smaller items, let's say you cover electricity bill, dinner  etc. Then maybe it's actually alright because in the end it will be approximately 50:50 for what is covered by both of you~ 

3. If the guy is really okay with any arrangement, who am I to say? What I want to say though, a lot of couples went through this phase when the guys would not mind paying more for the girls and again, consider what will happen in the future. Based on your dynamics, can it be the reason for a crack in your future relationship?

Do take note that they're my opinion and I might miss some other possible cases. In the end, it really depends on you and your partner. I wish you all the best in your relationship~"

There are some rare moments in life when you just feel comfortable talking to someone for a few times but yet there is no reason to meet again though like we are on two different paths in life.

58955,"Dear best friend, it has been years since we stopped talking. 

Ever since my jc years, you've always been the one I could turn to whenever I had problems. It was probably burdensome to you, but you dealt with it. I was a toxic friend to you. When you told me about that girl you clicked well with in your newfound job, I felt a strange mix of emotions. You have always been my ""strictly platonic"" friend but when you told me about her, about how she admired your codes, about how she understood you in a way I couldn't, I felt jealous. 

It was then I realised the root of my toxicity was not because I felt you weren't good enough for her (what I used to hurt you) but the fact that I caught feelings, and I didn't know what I wanted to do with those feelings. Ever had the feeling that someone was more than a friend, but less than a lover? That's how you were to me. 

You don't know how it kills whenever you asked me for advice to ask her out because I was, well, just a 'bro'.

I ultimately ghosted you because I wanted to move on, and I know moving on means I can't hold on to this platonish (or not) friendship. It hurt you deeply. But I'm glad things happened the way it did. I found out from a mutual friend that you are happily together with her. I have also found my significant other whom brings joy to my life everyday. Things had to fall apart for better things to fall together I guess.

I still don't have the courage to ask for your forgiveness for the way I treated you. But I hope you don't live your days wondering what you did wrong, because it was never about you. 

Happy birthday.

58953,"Genuine advice for all those asking about how much salary they should be getting: find out what you're worth, don't aim too high and don't settle for less. If you're a lazy bum with mediocre grades and portfolio, 3.5k starting pay is a real steal. If you're a decent student from a decent course, you should be aiming for a good 4k and above starting salary. Seriously though, the amount of salty people commenting about how 3.5k is already very good for a fresh grad and that we shldnt be greedy is too damn high. Get your head out of your ass people, and don't be so salty about fresh grads getting ""high"" pay cus some of them are really deserving. I have plenty of friends who are good at what they do, be it from business, engineering to computer science and have easily gotten starting pays of 5k or more. And I'm not even talking about the cream of the crop students with first class honours and a plethora of internship experiences, just decent students who put in effort during their course and proven themselves capable.

Only you know how capable you truly are and what you can do (unless you are delusional). And deep down only you know the kind of salary you should be getting. Just aim for this and you'll be fine. "

58946,"To the OP of #58946

I for one understand you completely. The rationality behind our thoughts and feelings are completely unlike others, who are not in our situation, can understand. Firstly, I want you to know that your internal conflict is completely valid. Your feelings are your own and no one can berate you for it. 

Now, what can we do about it? You mentioned you don't see yourself marrying your current bf. Do consider this: Is this a result of your conflicted feelings for your new friend? Think hard about it and maybe you'll find more answers. These kind of soul-searching will take time. So don't pressure yourself to make such a hasty decision, only to regret it later. You'll only put yourself, and the people you love, through unnecessary pain. One other thing you should consider is, are you sure the feelings you're developing for your new friend are romantic feelings? Maybe you've fallen for the deep connection that you managed to build with him and not for the person. Then you might wonder, ""shouldn't I have such deep connections with my own bf and not someone else?"" well, you can think that way. But it's also possible to establish a connection this close with someone and not have a romance with them. The possibilities are limitless. Some people might think otherwise but, who says we have to fit what other people think?

Once you figured that out, I'm sure you'll be able to answer that question you have. I know it's a hard decision but I believe you can get through it. And remember, whenever you do decide to make that decision, own it. Own that decision. One day you'll look back and think ""maybe I should've done sth different"", but then remember that you did what YOU thought was best at that time. 

Ultimately, just slowly think through it. I'm personally still struggling, but I know my moral values. We can't always get what we want, but we can get somewhere close and still be happy. 

Wishing you all the best! "

Well, I guess we already know the answer ourselves. Just that, we are often being ignorance to our own answers. Those who has been questioning regards their relationship here should question yourself and your partner what is the best solution for the both of you.

Question yourself will often prompt you to have critical thinking and often you'll come out the best answer for yourself too. So, need not to question here again. The only answer you'll get is just a confirmation of the answer in your heart."

I’m a party girl and I do hook up here and there, but that does not mean I have commitment issues or anything. In fact, I’d love to be in a committed relationship and give all of me to one guy. 

Maybe because I party very often, I only end up attracting guys who don’t want anything serious, or guys assume that I’m not looking for anything serious. I’m open to that too so I do go ahead with it if I like the guy, I mean I’m single so why not? But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want anything serious if it comes in my way. In fact, watching my friends who have boyfriends, I wish I could have something special with someone too. 

I party often because I love to dance, love the music, love dressing up and having a great time with my friends. So I don’t think me being a party girl should be reflective of how I would be in a relationship. I mean even if I am in a committed relationship, I do see myself going out to party just to enjoy the music and be with my friends.

As I was about to leave, my friend asked if I could send her home since we both lived around AMK and she was a little tipsy. On the drive back, we didn’t talk much, and I just dropped her off at the bus stop as she requested.

The next time we met was in the following semester where we both coincidentally joined the same planning committee. Throughout the sem, we had to work together, usually late after school and that was when we became closer. I found out more about how she lived in the rental flats and was embarrassed the first time I sent her home. She didn’t really come from a normal nuclear family and her father was in prison for drugs. As we got closer, I realized that I slowly started to fall for her despite her wild appearance. This was a girl who despite all the odds, still made it into a university. Despite her financial status, she was still buying gifts for her friends. And despite whatever life threw at her, she stood up strong and fought back.

We got together three months later, and all was well. However, after the first time we had sex, I just asked for fun whether she was a virgin and that was when my world crumbled. Of course, what a dumb question you must be thinking: but here I was hoping that I would be her first. When she told me how she had done it with her two previous boyfriends, and a fwb, I honestly felt disgusted and angry. As a guy, because of my ego, I felt a little ashamed of her and that I was using ‘used goods’. We argued quite a bit over that and within months, we broke up. 
The next year, my cousin got married and held his wedding at Amara Sentosa. As I was eating, I noticed a familiar back and when she turned around, that was when I recognized her. I couldn’t really tell what made me do it, but I then decided to walk up to her. We talked for a little and I realized she was working as a banquet server just to earn some pocket money over the weekends. We decided to head outside to talk and that was when we realized that we really missed each other and got back together.

I guess I am writing this out now because of all the recent posts on non-virgin girls, fwbs and what not. To the guys, I understand how you feel, I was there before. A nice unopened package, who wouldn’t want that right? Compared to the ex-party girls who simply are there for the fun, who have no character, no morals, no sense of shame. But let me tell you, that’s not what love is. Love is putting the other party before yourself. Love is when she stays up late just to wait for you to go home. Love is when there is a bowl of chicken soup in front of you when you are sick. Love is squeezing your hands tight when you nearly trip. So, to the boys out there, don’t narrow down your pool of girls just because of how they look, or their behavior in the past. 
Last week, she said yes to me. Give them a chance, and maybe you will give yourself one too. I love you XY.

- Only photos with no details at all. 
Translation: ""I want to be judged purely by my appearance""? 
No thanks.

- ""I want my date to get along well with me"" / ""I like travelling"" - 
Okay, almost everyone wants this? How about something more specific?

- ""I want to be treated like a princess""
Translation: ""My partner must put in a lot of effort and I reserve the right not to reciprocate""
Hmm...... Nah, why would I want to do that

- ""What I'm like is for me to know and for you to find out"" 
Translation: ""I'm entitled and expect my partner to do everything and be capable of reading minds"" 
How about no

- ""If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve at my best""

58930,I met my bf in my course a year ago but recently things are starting to tone down and the relationship is starting to dull. Is this normal or is he not the one
58929,Why are people so scared of being judged by your partner? You are who you are. Find someone that will accept you instead of hiding things. How long can you keep up the facade?
58927,Everybody talking about their fwb and/or their current bf/gf and I'm just sitting here like... How do I get one? 
58924,"Hi everyone,

I’d just like some advice. So I’ve graduated from a specialised course (not going to specify, but think along the lines of courses like medicine and dentistry). Majority of new grads become general practitioners or dentists, but I’m not exactly keen on these kind of jobs. I know, people will say things like ‘then why did you sign up for such courses in the first place?’. Well, I initially thought being a medical practitioner was for me, but after years of studying and internship, it isn’t. And honestly I’ve been delaying job searching because I’m just dreading working. I will be seeing a career counselor soon, but thought I’d like to hear advice from you guys about other possible career options (I’d like to have a relevant career as I’m done with studying for the meantime), or from seniors who were also in the same boat.

Thank you for reading :)"
58922,"With all the recent posts about party girls and people bashing them, my two cents is as follows:

Deciding to party or not is an individual's choice. If that person decides to have one night stands or FWBs, it is entirely up to that person. However, when they decide to get attached, you have to be truthful to your BFs/spouse. It is up to the guys if they are willing to pursue the relationship. Some are ok and some are not. If you decide to hide and it comes to light in the future, it can wreck your married life. It is always better to be truthful to each other from the start. The same goes for any health realted issues or even having an abortion before. For many, not being a virgin/ being a party girl might not be an issue. 

All the nonsense about carrying your secrets to your grave is messed up. Firstly, you don't know that it will remain a secret forever. Next, it is also messed up hiding something you did for your own benefit. "
58920,How can I tell my girlfriend that I want a polygamous relationship? 
58919,"Just gonna say this, life is very short. With the life expectancy hovering around 82-85, just do whatever makes you happy. If you want to have FWB go ahead, want to party go ahead, want to quit school and tour the world go ahead. 

If you care too much about how people judge you, are you living for yourself or others? We are all around 20s meaning we have 60 odd years left. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me (unless you’re a dumb piece of shit that let what others say affect you) "

I want to apply for a summer program that doesnt require interview to get in. For the edurec sign up, there is a personal statement section. Is it important? Do we write about why I want to go for the summer program or just generally about myself? Thank you in advance!"

A lot commenters say I got no moral and civil value. But aren’t we already over it? There are so many previous posts taking about moral but the conclusion is just that it is subjective and different people have different moral. Who are you to ride on high horse and judge others?

But why in my case, the same people are using moral to judge me? :( "
58905,I want to come NUS but i am afraid that i will not be able to stay in hall because of the commitment needed unlike NTU which offers 2 year guaranteed accomodation
58903,"I hear many stories from friends and acquaintances that their parents are just waiting for them to graduate and start working so they can finally retire and relax. 

I don't know how I feel about that, really. I love my parents very much and I want them to enjoy the remainder of their lives in peace, comfort and stability. 

But to keep harping on retirement and our filial obligated to them often makes me feel as if I'm just an economic instrument...

They have provided me with all they could have - an existence, food, shelter, security and occasionally affection. I'm endlessly grateful and indebted. But I believe that I have also tried my best to be a good child for them - do most of their chores, clean up the house, cook their meals and on top of all that - do well in school so that I may (or not) have a stable career. 

I just feel as if all my contributions to this parent-child relationship is invalidated cause I'm not the sole breadwinner for all these years. I know its really exhausting to work and support a family but I hope my parents can see my struggles (especially with the competitive workforce and school) and that I'm trying hard to provide them the best life, but they have to learn to be self - reliant too. 

I am willing to give them a huge portion of my salary and spend little on my own, but I hope that they will be prudent and thrifty when the time comes. 

Retirement is an individual responsibility, a social security and a family obligation. To rest the funding of decades of retirement squarely on your children might be unbearable for them. 

In the future if I have children and they have ""officially"" entered adulthood and start claiming their own paychecks, I will continue to work until my body fails. I will work for a meaning in life, work to maintain social connection, work to feel useful, positive and relevant. I could work less than before, but nonetheless working still. I will work for my financial independence and try not to rely entirely on my children, thereby risking poverty if they don't provide. Of course all this is based on the assumption that there will be work for me. 

I will be frugal and read, write, stroll in parks in my free time and engage in economical activities instead of wanting to roam far flung corners of the world. I will meditate, find my spirituality and continue to focus on the struggle to reconcile with the notion of impending death. 

I know that one has spent so much resources on raising their children at the expense of their own welfare - but the money, time and energy spent cannot be seen and written as a debt in official IOU. Your children has also brought you joy, happiness, companionship and pride which you bask and indulge in when you return home from work. They are not lifetime investment products you wait to claim upon the end of its term. 

Not trying to be offensive to older generations here. Just my opinions on this issue.

58901,"“Incel!” “Virgin!” “I’m offended!” “Misogynist!” “Reeeeeeeeeeeeee!!”

Yet. 

There is nothing, nothing in all your rage to disprove what I’ve said except that it offends your view of how men should behave and the types of women they should prefer. 

Everyone everyday talks about what women want, how we should do more for them, how men have always been privileged, no one bats an eyelid. 

Talk about men’s preferences for one day and everyone loses their minds!

Here’s a piece of data to support my statements.

58900,"girls will always tell dem nice guys ""you deserve better"" and to yall superficial people, once day you will regret not dating dem nice guys.

Usually nice guys are the loyal ones, the one who will love you to the sun and the moon because nobody wanna date them (cause kenna friendzoned). Hence, they will treat their first like their last. 

It's too late to regret once they are freaking successful and posts lovely dovey posts with their future girlfriend.

Sadly materialistic + superficial people are so common these days."
