61998,"Looking at the recent peeping tom saga, I noticed this trend of mob mentality where majority of the netizens have made it their duty to condemn the authorities for allegedly failing to give an adequate punishment to the perpetrator when they do not have access to full facts and may actually be barking up the wrong tree. (Let me state for the record that I do not condone the actions of the perpetrator and I do have a young daughter for whom I pray will never have to be caught up in such a situation).

I am especially disturbed at the fact about how much this event resembles the ""honor killing"" in some Middle Eastern countries where the community rises up to be judge, jury and executioner and eventually stones the criminal to death i.e. we are witnessing the online version of ""stoning to death"".

Case in example: OnHand Agrarian is the latest to hop on the bandwagon and has released a FB statement this morning to cut off all ties with NUS until the perpetrator has been expelled.

Seriously, is it already not unethical for this company to use such a heavy-handed approach in an attempt to strongarm NUS? Or perhaps the company thinks it is best to hop on the mob mentality bandwagon, distance itself from the perpetrator and join in the ""stone throwing""? This is totally opposite of how a company should run its CSR program.

Back to case in point, the Police has obviously gone through due process (i.e. conducted a diligent investigation, gather all available facts, compare to past cases and past established precedents, consulted with AGC etc.) before arriving at the outcome of issuing the 12 months conditional warning to the perpetrator. 

NUS must have also considered all available facts (including the outcome of Police investigations) to arrive at the punitive actions decided for the perpetrator. And yes, I agree the University does have gaps to address in its penalty system for student misconduct and that the social media outrage has most probably forced its hand to review the system which is not necessarily a bad outcome. 

However, should we all now take a step back, give time for the University to perform its own internal review and also give space for the perpetrator to reflect on his own actions? Seems like everyone has forgotten the perpetrator is also a fallible human being with emotions and it seems to me that he has enough punishment (both in tangible and non-tangible sense from the online raging) to last him for quite some time.

I like to end with this quote ""Forgiveness does not excuse their behaviour. Forgiveness prevents their behaviour from destroying your heart"" - applies to both sides"
61995,"Can you all PLEASE stop framing the current debate in terms of 'what if she was your daughter' / 'your girlfriend' ? 

It literally does not matter. It is irrelevant. To have empathy, you should not NEED to picture a female who is in someway related to you. It is enough that a person has been harmed. It doesn't matter who she is. "
61991,"I am appalled by a Facebook page that calls themselves ""NUSSU - NUS Students United"" when they decide to leak out Board of Discipline cases to the public. While the recent sexual harassment saga within campus does call for reform to how our university treats such cases, I see no positive benefits in leaking out Board of Discipline cases other than to harm our reputation as a university and student community. Furthermore, the anonymous group of admins behind ""NUSSU - NUS Students United"" could not be verified to be undergraduates in NUS and should not have the right to leak such posts. I urge the University to take a serious view in this matter as it affects the reputation of not just the University but of the alumni as well.

61990,"My two cents worth in response to the Monica Baey incident. I don't think NUS doesn't care about the safety of its students. I was personally involved in catching one guy filming in one of the toilet. Here's the story: 
I went to the toilet and a group of girls were muttering among themselves looking panicky. I asked what happened and one of them told me she was filmed by a peeping tom using his handphone in the toilet from the other cubicle and suspected the peeping tom was just sitting at the lobby area near the toilet as she could recognize the hp cover. I immediately took the victim to report to the campus security  while asking the other girls to keep watch not to let  guy leave. The security followed us back to the incident location immediately.  Upon seeing the security, the guy tried to run away and security gave chase. After confronting the guy and looking into his hp photo collection but couldn't find the actual footage, security called the police. This happened on a Saturday. The chief campus security investigator dropped what he was doing outside and came back immediately (he explained this as he was dressed in T-shirt, shorts and slippers as if looking rather unprofessional). The police came and took the guy away. When i asked what's going to happen to the guy, campus security said as this was a criminal case, they have to let the police handle it. Btw this happened in a rather public area of nus. 

For those who are still condemning Nus about the Monica case, I'm not sure if you are targeting the right board! Nus is not the police. What's been handled to the police stays with the police.  Nus is here to educate people. By condeming nus for allowing this peeping to be back studying,  does it mean also that education institution should not allow any ex-criminals to be enrolled? So much talking about giving ex-criminals a 2nd chance, how is that possible without first embracing the chance to education?"
61988,"I am the OP of #61988 and I am responding to Sage Stark's post which follows: ""Please forgive someone if he peep at your daughter next time and all the school did was 12 months warning and a letter of apology given to your daughter. Please forgive me for typing this as well. =)""

I should not be the person to forgive the perpetrator. If my daughter is of similar age as the victim in question, then it will be up to my daughter, whom I expect to possess sufficient maturity by that age, to decide on her own. 

I would hope that my daughter can have the magnanimity to forgive and have the strength to cast aside all the negative emotions generated from the incident and move on to achieve greater things in her life instead of having any one particular negative incident define any part of her life.

However, I will not push her to accept or reject the apology as it must be her choice alone (assuming she is already mature enough). I can only counsel or guide as her father. 

Lastly, I do accept your apology too, whether heartfelt or not =)"
61987,"#61913: true that we're only hearing her side. but the guy can go public with his side of the story as well. this guy has (or, had) an instagram account, he could have put his own side on instastory if he wants to. but he didn't, which shows that he chose not to say anything. you can interpret that how you want, but any reasonable person would interpret it to mean that he has nothing substantial to add in his defence.

also your last paragraph is a mess. you agree that harsher punishment means lesser crimes, but you also think that peeping tom won't stop if we make harsher punishment? clearly this means the punishment isn't harsh enough. either that, or you think that there is no deterrent effect, in which case you contradicted yourself."
61986,"Massive uncalled for TLDR post aka /when procrastination strikes/: Some thoughts on the recent controversy. 

Was the campaign demanding change manipulative? Yes it was. As are many successful campaigns. Purposed narratives were fed to you through your feeds, accompanied with powerful calls to action and immense social pressure to support the cause. The best narratives (factually accurate or not) are always presented in the way which helps the writer's cause most. So, in that sense, a lot of manipulation went down. Your emotions and sentiments were skilfully managed by content creators. 

And the numbers tell. It was a well-executed, effective campaign. 

But that's not necessarily a bad thing, and charges of manipulation on the part of the campaign starters merely distract from larger concerns now illuminated by the controversy. So do debates on their personal agenda and possible revengeful motives. To put this simply: if I started a charity seeking to glorify myself, this charity can still be of good to society. Personal and public interests are not always mutually exclusive.

Perhaps more helpful questions to step back and ask are: What is the extent of the problem -- based on reliable facts -- which this cause is concerned with? What good comes out of widespread support for this? What are the potential ramifications? These three factors need to be thought out, and weighed against one another. 

In writing this, my intention is not to favour any side. I hope that we, especially those of us in a position of less emotional attachment than the parties involved, can all go beyond the anger, anxiety, and consternation we feel. These emotions may motivate the burdens we have towards particular groups in the community, towards particular vulnerabilities, or our ability to empathise with various parties. Sure, and that's perfectly normal. 

But they should not reduce our views to mere labels (""victim-blamer"") and tag lines (""doxxing is wrong!"", ""we want change!"", ""blame the police not NUS""), much worse labels sitting on polarised extremes.This is a complex, multi-faceted issue. There are many things that need consideration, and many interests at stake. Sure, this situation is symptomatic of some systemic fault, and we want some kind of change; but to what extent, at what cost, and by what means? 

For voices to be heard, they need to ride on the momentum of mass support, and mass support works best with loud, catchy tag lines. I get that. But now that they've have been heard, I hope that we'll stop using our voices as passionate, well-intentioned instruments that drown out other frequencies, but instead carefully wield them as tools.  

TLDR: Let's have more productive, informed dialogues -- in which we present our views with all their warranted nuances. "
61984,May I remind all of you that all we have so far is Monica's one side of the story? Everything about her insinuating that there was sufficient evidence for heavier punishment is her side of the story. Do we really think the Police/AGC are so incompetent that they would not press charges if the evidence would sufficiently hold up in court? I fear for the future of guys in this country if any accusations without proof can destroy someone's life irrevocably. Next thing we know we start having people weaponising selfish agendas under the guise of sexual harassment like the Kavanaugh case.
61979,"Wanted to add that in light of the recent saga, I thought this is a good reminder of how our sexuality education is sorely lacking, and perhaps even failed us. 

As a female, I have always been a huge pervert ever since my first sexual awakening. I have been a masochist for years and fantasised myself as a masochist, and eventually enjoyed such endeavours in the bedroom. But in my pursuit of sexual happiness, there were several points where I had to figure things out on my own. Two main ones were how to accept myself as a sexual deviant; And how to differentiate fantasy from reality. 

The first was resolved when I realised that most people have some kind of fetish, somehow and deviant isn't that abnormal. Everyone is a little weird. 

The second, I got by through reading and learning from peers. And the second is the one i felt is relevant in the recent sagas. Instead of labelling peeping toms as fringe, abnormal, deviant or pervert, more could and should be done about improving awareness on how to differentiate fantasy from reality and also how to manage such fantasies. My two cents really. "
61978,"Those who are critical of Monica’s methods and intents really need to re-examine the situation. From her first post till now, NUS has really taken no additional concrete action other than well convening a committee, and even that is no guarantee of seeing any positive change. So if you think she was justified in blowing up the issue in the first place, you should be equally upset now to know with all the “change” happening. While convening a committee is a good step and NUS should be given some time to get their s**t together, it does not help that there has been no expressed intent to reconsider the severity of their sentence given to Nicholas, which is really the crux of this whole issue.

This leads to my second point about rehab. In the OSA email, “the rehabilitative needs of the student offender” was one of the factors considered in the punishments, so it is understandable that they gave a lighter punishment to Nicholas for rehab purposes. However, none of the punishments have addressed address “the need for justice for the victim”. Of the penalties stated in the NUSSU email: 

1. Does nothing to make the victim feel better. A semester’s suspension is about as much of a punishment as a gap semester holiday. If anything, Nicholas now has an internship to boast in his resume
2. Doesn’t even affect Nicholas since he doesn’t stay on campus. 3. Well I guess Monica will know NUS now has one less sexual predator if the counselling worked
4. Great that Nicholas is helping out the needy in the community but again, this does nothing to address justice for Monica. 
5. Just about as effective as 3
6. Monica has already expressed how woefully inadequate this letter is in doing justice to her, and i'm not sure if an email through the school really expresses sincerity
7. Probably the closest to any form of justice for Monica
In other words, none of the punishments meted out seem to even address the point of justice for the victim. They may serve other purposes, but this is perhaps why Monica still feels outrage despite these “hefty” punishments. Even though the “decisions and penalties imposed by the authorities” is another factor, NUS has also stressed that their disciplinary actions “are not a substitute for criminal proceedings”, so there is no reason as to why they need to reduce their punishments given just because SPF’s one is light too. And if we are upset with SPF for giving such a light sentence, we should be equally upset with NUS for what they are doing too. While I do agree that Nicholas’ punishments should still give him a chance a rehab, this is waaayyyy to light for a sexual assault. In the interest of protecting Monica from encountering the perpetrator in school, I think the least NUS could do is to impose a suspension for at least a year or more, so that she does not have to see his face at all, and at least the suspension would amount to something. 

In another point, some think that she has committed doxing by revealing his Instagram page. In my opinion, I think that for someone who was pushed into a corner after SPF and NUS could not help her any further, the least she could do to claim justice for herself was to shame Nicholas in public. Some might say that this is an emotional justification for what she was doing, so it holds no weight as a real justification. But in the broader sense of her strategy of garnering attention to pressure NUS to do something, revealing the identity of Nicholas does help to catch the attention of the public and boost the support she is garnering. 

So its really not so much of emotional sentiments that people seem to be blindly supporting her. People are not supporting Monica out of sympathy just because she’s playing the victim card, people are supporting her because Nicholas’ punishments are woefully inadequate, and more punitive measures are desperately needed. And to those who think that Monica is simply trying to destroy Nicholas’ life out of revenge, I hope you can see that there are real and solid reasons why she is continuing to express her disappointment and anger at the current situation, and there is more to be gained out of this debate than simply revenge. The push for more change has just begun, and there is still no indication that the injustice done to her will be corrected, so we don’t have any strong reason to believe she is overstepping the line and is just trying to sabotage the guy. To those who think we only have Monica’s side of the story, well the facts that were sent out in OSA’s and NUSSU’s email seem to corroborate the inadequacy of the punishments. To those who want to judge her for posting her excitement about being in the news, well this is an emotional point and should have no barring on matters of facts like those above. And even so, I am of the opinion that she is more satisfied by a small triumph that things have finally turned her way after seeing s**t play out like that for so long. And to those who think that Monica shouldn’t have gotten his friends involved, well this is quite true, I guess she should have censored their faces or something.  But let me also add that Nicholas' girlfriend made news for herself not just because her face was on his Instagram, but because of how willing she was to passively support his offences. To those who think that we may have traumatised Nicholas too much with this hullabaloo, that’s a highly unusual defence to make for a perpetrator. But even so, I think that being publicly shamed is part of the punishments in today’s world where its hard to escape the public eye and news spreads fast. Nicholas should have considered this before committing his crime. Even if he was drunk, it is perfectly reasonable to expect him to accept it as part of the consequences of his actions. Honestly if he’s reading this, my advice to him to just be to come out with a personal public apology and be willing to accept a stiffer punishment should NUS want to impose more on him. I think that will at least do something to address the point of justice for the victim and show some unforced form of remorse. Oh and to those who think Monica is manipulating us as a media student… come one man, you can do better than that. And nope I’m not Monica, I’m just another fellow engineering student who is disgusted by such acts.

PS: admins please let this post through as much as possible. If needed to maintain the confidentiality of the punishments (even though it was sent to all NUS students?), please redact as much as needed."
61976,"As another fellow female student from Monica Baey’s batch, I’m appalled to see the avalanche of accusations of her attention-seeking purpose. How not a single of these accusers even spare a note of empathy towards the victim, or mention her distress and trauma, but very readily spill venoms towards a person most of you probably don’t know in real life. What is even more disturbing, at least to me, is how these people are my school mates, maybe even someone I know, interact with. I guess that the way people react to unusual events can unveil a lot about their lesser-known side.

Guys, maybe if you’re not a woman, you will not understand the humiliation, the feelings of being violated, of helplessness, and shame for something you did not even do, and the fear that ensues weeks, months afterwards. It’s easier for the victim as well, to sweep it under the rug, forget about it, move on with life, rather than dealing with the emotional distress once we accept what has happened. Therefore, Monica, I admire your courage and strength to face the truth, and thank you for the goodness in your heart, that led you to share your story, regardless of all the negative consequences this can bring to you in the future (in your personal life, career and social relationships etc), in a hope of bringing about changes. Keep your head up girl, and thank you.

Lastly, I wonder, for the people who throw accusations around and people who support this view; if this incident has involved your girlfriends, your sisters, your female friends, your daughters; would you have done what you’re doing to a stranger? Or would you have wanted other people to treat your girlfriends/sisters/daughters/friends the way you’re treating Monica?"
61975,"Honestly before today’s email by NUSSU Exco, I thought Nic was only made to write an apology letter and be suspended for a semester. I got this impression from the original insta story from the victim and like many others, I thought that these punishments are not sufficient to teach him a lesson. Although I didn’t repost and stuff but mentally I supported the victim and believed whatever she said.

Now that the email informed me about the list of punishments that Nic will be subjected to, I am ashamed that I didnt take a deeper look into the matter before forming an opinion. I merely trusted the information that is presented to me as the whole truth.

Taking a step back, I think that the list of punishments is sufficient for a first time offender like Nic, and is in line with NUS’s aim to re-educate. Don’t get me wrong, I do not side with Nic by any means but I do think that he should be given a chance to correct his mistakes. And definitely by expelling him, ruining his life or shaming his family and friends are not helping to re-educate him.

So my point is that the incident has already gotten enough attention and we should leave the rest to NUS and SPF.

Cheers and all the best for finals :)"
61972,"First of all, we can all agree that what the perpetrator has done in the Monica Baey case is criminal and deserves punishment. The severity and kind of punishment is up for debate. 

There are a few matters that need to be recognized before anything else. 

1. The perpetrator has been named by the victim. 

This action is irreversible and in itself it is an extra-juridical action. Whether the victim has a right to this action is up for debate once again. However, people need to recognize that naming the perpetrator is a punishment meted out that is not sanctioned by the court. In this case, the perpetrator has gotten a third charge on top of the 12 month conditional warning given by the police and the actions taken by NUS. In spite of claims by the victim that there is no intention to exact further punishment, naming the perpetrator is itself a punishment regardless whether the victim reserves the right to do so or not. 

2. The media attention and follow-up actions taken by NUS & support groups 

The number of media outlets reporting on this case is huge compared to past cases of sexual offenses. Follow-up actions by NUS on this case was significantly greater compared to other cases. 

A review committee was formed, NUSSU was involved in discussion for heavier penalties and a petition was formed. If we were to turn to a case that is some years ago, (this case was from NTU, but similar to NUS, it happened in our public university), 66 male students were being filmed over the span of 5 months. 
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-arrested-for-allegedly-filming-other-students-in-the-7763030
No review committee was set up, much lower media attention was given to the case then.

Why did the other cases of sexual offenses deserve less attention and coverage than this most recent case? Does the crime commit against 66 weigh less than the crime committed against 1? 

We need to recognize that signing the petition and asking for harsher punishments means a departure from a rehabilitative model to a punitive model. If you were the victim’s parents, of course, you would want a harsher punishment on the perpetrator. However, if the perpetrator happens to be your kid, would you ask for harsher punishment? Do you think your kid deserves a second chance or do you think your kid should just burn in hell?

When you ask for a “different environment” for your daughter, sisters and gf, you are also asking for a harsher environment where mistakes are less tolerable and forgiveness a non-existent concept. That said, you have every right to sign the petition but do consider both sides of the coin. "
61968,"Thank you Monica. Thank you for bringing this to light. I myself was victim of sexual harassment on campus. I complained to my Resident Fellow. He confessed and was given a warning. I wish I didn’t complain because the hall residents said I must have “wanted it” and I “liked the attention”. If it happened again, I probably wouldn’t have said anything if not for this case. Justice can be served if we are brave enough to seek it. Thank you Monica. Your bravery means so much more than you know "
61967,"In case you did not know, the perpetrator of the recent saga is currently doing his internship attachment. So his suspension from NUS is not any loss to him because he’s ultimately boosting his resume out there with work experience. I still see many people saying the one semester suspension is a good enough punishment which I doubt so. If the victim never voiced out what happened, he will be happily moving on with his life with almost no implications for his wrong doings. Also those against the victim because she seems to be taking “revenge” rather than seeking for justice, let’s remember that it would’ve taken so much courage to voice out the truth and she did not do it knowing it’ll get so much attention. At this point this whole issue is blown out of proportion. The fact that authorities have said to step up and take more actions/review the current policies is a good outcome everyone should be happy about moving forward. So stop bashing either the victim or perpetrator at this point. Please move on. Maybe offer some thoughts and prayers to the victims and families suffering in Sri Lanka now?"
61964,"I have very little sympathy for Nicholas, and I think so do many of you who are seem to be alright with doxxing him. But even if you don't quite care about what happens to him, I would like you to consider the spillover harassment that his family members/friends might also have to endure, especially when they may not deserve the full brunt of the Internet's outrage. The truth is that there is very little argument that can be given in support of doxxing - internet mobs are irrational, are poor discriminators of target, and are not accountable to anybody - even if you think he is completely deserving of what he is getting, can you say the same for his loved ones? 

Punishing him should not have to fall on the internet - it should be the task of NUS Disciplinary Board and Singapore's Judiciary to ensure that proper and proportionate punishment is meted out. That's why if there's any entity or practice that should be brought to light - it should be the mishandling of this case by the appropriate authorities. It is possible to name and shame these organisations and practices without having to do the same with the individual. "

61946,"Machiavellian Lessons from the peeping tom saga:

""Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.""
~Niccolo Machievelli

1. Mob justice is sweet, effective, and efficient
It's 2019, everyone's getting woke. If you feel like you can't get the justice you want through due process, simply tap on the court of public opinion via social media. Much faster than going to the authorities which often require jumping through bureaucracy and which are much less focused on retribution than the public would be, since they will have to consider many other different factors in sentencing.

2. Always have a call to action involving the greater community
Nobody's interested in personal vendettas (this guy owes me money, make him famous, anyone?). Instead, frame it in such a way that your problem becomes everyone's problem. By making others feel like they have a personal stake in the issue, you greatly increase the chances of making it go viral. Finally, clearly state what you want people to do. In Monica's case, the desired goal is harsher punishment for Nicholas from NUS; with added framing, it becomes to review sentencing frameworks for sexual harassment, such that Nicholas and all future offenders get harsher punishments, on the basis that this will deter future cases of sexual harassment, and create a safer environment for female students living in hall.

(Note: Notice that what happened is a criminal offence and completely out of NUS' domain as an academic institution (the perpetrator could have been any random member of public, for whom NUS' punishments have zero deterrence). This is irrelevant - you need only paint a connection, and people will follow. Most will not scrutinize the logic of it)

3. Always ""hedge"" against moral risk
You risk getting discredited once you lose the moral high ground you are standing on, so always be mindful to stay on top. Revenge and name-and-shames are morally dubious, so always add a disclaimer to say that these are not your intentions (even if they are - especially if they are). What Monica did is a textbook example of making the name-and-shame appear like an unintended side effect of a greater cause. Unfortunately, she made a rookie mistake by stating in one of her earlier stories that she's sick of Nicholas being able to live life normally (and apparently post on Instagram). Don't do that, it reveals the intention for revenge. However, this is not a critical mistake, as it is understandable for victims to desire revenge.

4. Always go for the easy targets first
Notice that Monica didn't go after the police, even though the case was theirs to handle, and maintaining a safe environment for all is their responsibility? Instead she pointed her guns at NUS, even making it seem like the lenient police punishment (or lack thereof) of a 12-month conditional warning was their doing. The answer is simple - NUS is a much easier target, because they love their reputation more than they love their students, and especially because they have already been in the public spotlight recently for sexualized orientation games, leaving them vulnerable to scandals of this sort. Throw in accusations of a cover-up to create a perfect storm of public outrage.

5. Always claim intoxication when retrospectively caught committing a crime
Of course, if you're caught red-handed, this probably wouldn't work. But if it's the day or week after, alcohol intoxication can be a good excuse or mitigating factor for any reprehensible action. Essentially, you're trading in a major sin for a minor one. Even if it doesn't work, it's worth a try since it dosen't cost you anything to claim intoxication.

6. Contain the sources (apologize and make it up to the victim)
Machiavelli would have advised you to silence the victim as fast as possible back in the Renaissance era. That doesn't work so well now in 2019. Still, you have to contain the incident at their sources, lest you end up like Mr. Nicholas now. Always make it up to the victim in every way you can - buy gifts, apologize in person as sincerely as possible, grovel if you must. Build as much goodwill and rapport as you can with the victim, for this greatly decreases the risk of them forming a personal vendetta. Do this even if you are let off easy (by the authorities). Consider it buying insurance (coming from advisors' clique, Nicholas should understand this better than most)

(Note: When apologizing, always make it seem like YOU didn't intend to do it, that some kind of sickness compelled you to do it, and that you hate yourself for that. This makes the victim feel sorry for you and paints the narrative that you are also a victim (of your sickness) in this incident, which puts the two of you on the same side. See Andy Hui apology for example)"
61945,"I personally feel that Monica Baey went from speaking up for herself and all sexual harassment victims to milking it for the fame and enjoying it. While she gains more than two thousand followers in this episode, Nicholas has since deleted his Instagram account. Can any friend of Nicholas speak up to offer an alternative story? "

61943,"Hi #61943, 

I've been in an LDR for ~3 years myself, and I can relate to the worries in your post. 

For me, the most important thing was to communicate. Try to be honest with each other, and be upfront about your individual expectations. For example, you said ""I feel that if a person really matters to me, I will still find time everyday to talk to her..."" Does she know you think this? It also sounds like you weren't officially in a relationship before she left. Would you be hurt if she decided to date someone while overseas, and vice versa? Try talking it out with her, and see if her expectations of the relationship match with yours. 

If you both decide to go ahead with the LDR, here are some tips: 
- Arrange visits if you can. It really helps to know when you'll see each other again; even better if you know the final deadline of the LDR when you'll be together. It's nice to take turns to visit, but if not then discuss it openly, don't let flights/money become a sore point. 
- About flights: Google Flights is great, in particular for tracking flight prices. It's best to buy from the airline directly; avoid fishy-looking third parties. If you plan to fly frequently, look for card rebates, discounts, points etc. 
- If money is a problem but you're determined, this is a chance to get resourceful. Part-time jobs can help (NUS has some). 
- Make sure to continue living your life while apart. You'll have more interesting things to share when you message or meet up. If you can, do something fun/creative with the messages and calls, or try snail mail :)  

If something doesn't work out, it's okay to agree to separate, and try again if in future you're both single and in the same place. Good luck!

61941,"My Boyfriend definitely wants to get married in the near future but I’m really hesitant. I’ve been there done that and got burnt. It taught me that marriage is nothing but a legalised union, a signed certificate. What if I don’t want to tie myself down legally but still want to be with him? What if I don’t mind living the married life, and even have kids next time, but just not get married for the sake of it?

61935,"As someone who used to see a psychiatrist for anxiety and panic attack and is still living with it 3 years later. I think more need to be done to raise more awareness of mental illness.

 I’m sure most ppl know what mental illness are. So instead of raising awareness for mental illness.

 Raise awareness on how companies, family members, society, institutions and friends than empathize with them and support them along the way. 

My friends and family doesn’t just need to know that my anxiety triggers panic attack but what are the potential causes that will trigger it and to be more patient with me when it gets in the way of work. 

I’m sure all nurses not even those mental health trained ones know have the theorical knowleadge of the common mental illness but how many of them are able to empathize and help in the recovery process?"
61934,"I'm together with my boyfriend for slightly over half a year now. I lost my virginity to him but he's had one other partner before me (his ex). However, he is not say very experienced. He always asks me to give oral sex him during sex and even when he doesn't, I still would. However, he never reciprocates (he tried once but stopped after a short while). Also, I have not orgasmed during sex with him before. He does not seem to think that it is an issue and is not interested in doing anything to make me feel otherwise. What can I do? Pls don't tell me to break up :("
61930,"Rather than talking and participating in the hate ‘campaign’, why not just study and do well for the finals. Whatever yall try to achieve to do will not end up with tangible results.

61925,Maybe the reason why sg has low crime rates is because for every first crime u are caught for u get a conditional warning?
61923,should more people be focused on finding a solution to the toilets and access such that similar incidents will not happen again? having a harsher punishment is important but i doubt it will really stop someone from doing such acts if he really wants to. #foodforthought 
61921,"If Monica Baey really was about raising awareness and pushing for change, then she should be a decent human being and stop the witch hunting and mob lynching now with all the news she’s getting. But given her actions, I can’t help but feel she’s wants nothing else but to see the perpetrator burn in hell and milking her fame in the process. I’m one of fair punishment and pushing for justice, but the way so many people are being outright evil and toxic towards the perpetrator/anyone with alternative views is so gross. You act like you’re on a moral high horse but you post the nastiest comments and become a bully in the process to anyone who doesn’t think like you. Reflect on yourself. Probably gonna get hate for this but think about it. "
61920,"Hi guys, I need some advice or just let me know what you all think. I come from a financially difficult family background and I have never flown overseas before. Although in the past there had been assistance from past school programs, e.g. exchange, or when I can already afford to for myself (ORD trips), I chose not to go because of my own personal obligations in 有福同享，有难同当 (sharing fortunes and misfortunes together). Since my parents haven't traveled overseas for holidays, I did not want to either. However, recently I feel like breaking this obligation and going after my very close friends jio me (turned down their invitations for previous trips), but at the same time I may feel guilty and bad if my first trip is not going with my parents. Then I feel like maybe I would get to know where to go for in that country and bring my parents next year, or maybe this is sad excuse. My parents probably wouldn't really mind because my siblings have gone overseas for holiday before. I also believe I have symptoms of mild depression/ocassionally major, can't really decide what to do, even deciding to post this took few months omg lol. What should I do? Thanks a lot!"
61919,"In regard to #61877 (the OP who said she just wants a simple life after studying for many years and completing uni);

Not sure if anyone is in the same position. I'm female and my family background is quite humble so I grew up with a lot of unfulfilled wants. As a result, I am very fearful about not having enough money and became quite career-oriented. I often go the extra mile at my job, but I'm under constant fear about under-performing over every little hiccup. 

I don't enjoy my life because everyday I'm thinking of what my bosses think of me today, what I can do to get the next increment or promotion. It's unhealthy and I don't want to just sprint through these 10 years to wake up at 35 with grey hair (I'm a woman, so that's not cool :'( )and realise that my best years are already behind me. 

Furthermore, my SO is a very kind man who likes kids but I am so fearful of the future (what if I can't give my kid ""enough""? will they have to choose between being kind but mediocre, vs being competitive but successful? will they have to work even harder than me to attain my current standard of living? can I support them while also saving for my retirement?) that I can't see myself as a mum while my other friends look ready to pop one within the next 2 years. My SO jokingly says that my brain is 'damaged' because I grew up poor and financially insecure.

Is there anyone who felt the same as me in middle/late 20s but eventually got through this period? How did it happen? "
61918,"I refused to say her name because she is definitely not the victim now. She is a perpetrator of hate crimes. Stop feeding her fame. Now, I implore you to put yourself in Nicholas's shoes.

61913,"OP of #61913 here.

I just want people to respect the police/legal system and not take matters into their own hands.

If u think there's a problem with the system, challenge with the system in the right way without harming others. 

Yes, she-who-will-not-be-named was traumatized by he-who-will-not-be-named. But that doesn't justify her destroying his life. When did we forget the saying, ""An eye for an eye make the whole world blind.""? How we are treat others is a reflection of ourself, how other people treat us should not affect that. 

To all those who accept her actions and told me to consider if she was my mother or girlfriend or sister or daughter. The answer I give u is the same I will not condone her actions of revealing the perpetrator and dealing her own form of punishment in the form of doxxing even if it's my relative or close friend who is the victim.

To those saying this is victim blaming, this is not victim blaming. Victim blaming is this: ""She should not have bathe in Hall, she is just asking for it, I mean it's well known that there are peeping Toms in NUS Halls."" 

How about you guys consider if he was your father or son or brother or boyfriend. Yes I will hate, despise him for his actions but I will be happy for him that he got lucky, that the system let him off easy, gave him a second chance.

P. S. Yes I know technically there could be one guy with one guy left. "
61909,"The recent saga in NUS sparked a change in policy making, and spearheaded many important and crucial changes in our school community. However, was what Monica did the right way to approach things? And what does she really want out of all this?

My discussion points are on voyeurism and doxxing, and what the appropriate amount of punishment is for the victim. Head over to the NUS website, and you can find their official statement and how they approached this. TLDR; NUS believes in rehabilitation, thus explaining their use of relatively light sentencing as compared to the ""real world"" where incarceration is mandatory. It's great that Monica did something to change the NUS policy and make the factor of deterrence even stronger, but could there be a better way to do so? 

Monica mentions the psychological trauma that she has went through, and by no means do i belittle that. However, reading her insta stories for the past few days, the line between beneficence and seeking revenge seems to be blurred. What she has essentially done is pit the whole nation against her perpetrator, and while I agree that he deserves a much more severe punishment, the way she has done seems to be out of spite. She is essentially out to destroy him, and his family, his friends, and whatever he stands for. He deserved the punishment and much more, but don't you think that we as a society are overlooking the trauma that this may have been causing him?

Sure, you may say that she has went through much worse, and well, an eye for an eye, he deserves the same, maybe even worse kind of treatment. I believe in punishment, but I do also believe in adequate punishment and rehabilitation. If you tell me that his life is over after this saga, I'm not surprised. Blasting his name out on instagram, the numerous reposts she has garnered, every news station reporting on this, we are essentially throwing someone out into the sea with his limbs tied, and hope that he will come back alive as a better person. 

Am i siding with the victim? Nope. In fact, I was guilty of reposting and doxxing the victim online, until i took a step back and realized that this isn't the way i wanted change to be enacted. Seeing her instagram posts ""mom, i made it on the news"", and overly mentioning the word ""justice""  just makes me doubt her cause. 

Like Monica, I do want to change to be enacted, and if this happened to me or my family members, I would wish hell upon the perpetrator. But, the difference is that I believe in rehabilitation and second chances, and as much as i hate him, I would refrain from getting his family and friends involved by posting all his details online. And if my story does get out to news companies, I would be relieved and thankful that my story was heard, and not feel overly excited that I made it to the news.

To everyone who has made it to the end, do think about what we want as a society. And to Monica, I do sincerely hope that you recover from this ordeal, because what happened to you was not ok by any means or standard. But now that you are in a position to enact change, hopefully you would do the best thing possible :)"
61908,"To the person who wrote this on the NUS Official Statement Facebook Post, if you even read NUSWhispers, you have my respect, I think you hit the nail on the head."
61905,"Just wondering abt the harassment case, so if the victim is a non-nus student and the perpetrator is also a non-nus student but the incident happened within NUS, what happens? Still rehabilitation? Or will there be police prosecution? Shouldn’t nus students receive the same human rights/privacy as a member of public? I’m speaking up as someone who got filmed by another guy a few years back in hall. I’ve graduated btw."
61904,"With regards to the harassing incident, I would like to come forth and mention that in my RC and house, a similar incident happened abt 1-2 years back. A guy was filming other guys showering and even in the suites toilets with a camera. I’m not sure if he filmed the mixed gender or the girls floor. He was caught and forced to leave the rc only. No other punishments were enforced. He didn’t even write an apology letter and the incident was not made known to the students. The punishments given for this kind of unacceptable behavior is too light. What happens if he repeat the offence again after he graduate? Or even commit more serious offenses?"
61900,"Reading all the submissions on here discussing the filming incident makes me want to laugh at how some people are bending over backwards to imply the victim is doing it for attention or revenge. How would you feel if this was your daughter? Your friend? Your significant other?

This incident was reported months ago, and NUS handled it badly, regardless of whether the punishment was adequate or not. Now that the matter has gained publicity they're urging future victims to come forward, but how should we trust the school to protect us or take our reports seriously? The letter of apology from the school reeks of insincerity. Empty words mean nothing."
