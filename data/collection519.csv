But the sad thing is I didn't get the opportunity to be part of that CCA. So sad, long time no see her.

51974,"#51964 to add on, there was a period when i was unemployed and searching for jobs. Her department had 2 full time open vacancies for entry degree holders and she never once told me about it. I know because another friend works in the same civil service place as her and told me about it. We werent close but i appreciated her gesture. When i finally got a job elsewhere by myself and she knew about it, she contacted me and i dont know if she was pretending or what. She offered me a ""2 or 3 months contract job that required only o levels"" in that same department of hers. I declined and told her i was working for a year already and told her that she knew. She said "" in case you need a job again and also this job is better than nothing"" implying that i would be jobless again soon or that i was expected to quit my current job for her offer. Last i saw, she has been promoted to a senior manager in that dept. Never knew she didnt want me on her team because she thought i would be an obstacle to her promotion. Another time i asked if her friend could help give my resume to his company, a private financial institution. Both of them readily accepted my resume but just kept quiet after that. I followed up but he said he already gave to hr. Last i heard he went for my job in my previous company. She knew about it but pretended not to know and continued hanging out with him. Maybe because he has a house and is more successful than me? I know you probably think i am so stupid to continue the friendship that time. But i have learnt my lesson well.  "

Don't ask me why I'm watching webcast coz sometimes u just really can't make it for maybe half of the lecture."
51969,"There has been a few posts regarding loners not making friends and stuff. I would like to add a disclaimer that there are 2 types of loners. 

First, there are those who are alone because they are socially awkward and can’t make friends. Then they come on NUSWhispers to rant about having no friends. Usually these people intensely desire a one-and-only BFF just for themselves. 

Second, there are those who are alone because they are perfectly happy being alone, eating alone, and attending classes alone. This way, they have more control over their own time. 

These loners that you see have a close circle of friends, it’s just low-maintenance friendship but equally high in quality because they’ve come a long way and they provide space for one another. 

Since these loners often go about their lives in school alone, they have the freedom to speak to anyone they like. As such, these loners have a handful of acquaintances as well. And honestly, these loners don’t care if they are ever going to meet their acquaintances again because they are independent to begin with. Nor do these loners seek to have a BFF because it’s annoying to have someone sticking by you everyday. 

If there are no tables available in the canteen and you see a loner eating alone, feel free to share the table with them. They will be happy to share it with you. They don’t bite, neither do you have to shame them on NUSWhispers for table hogging.

I hope you enjoyed this short Nat Geo narration of the loners species in school. "
51967,"To the people who feels like #51950: speaking as someone who was pretty much a loner throughout university; joining the occasional clubs and activities that I feel interested in, graduated some 7 years ago, happily married now, after graduation until my wedding day, I spent perhaps 6 months or so single in total; it's not hopeless if you make no friend in university.

In my experience, making friends in university is like making friends at an airport transit lounge, the probability of meeting them again and keeping contact is pretty low. My experience is potentially a bit biased since I'm an international student a bit of a loner who does not need that many friends (but a close significant other, possibly), and I recently moved somewhere else to pursue my PhD. However, there is a very important thing that will restrict your social and dating lives if you don't have it: money. I don't mean in the way that all girls are gold-diggers; it's the fact that with money, you can afford to be spontaneous, zoom about, doing things, and not having to worry too much. Of course your budget restricts what you can do: making a spontaneous trip to Paris is not exactly what I can do with a research assistant salary or a PhD student stipends; but dinners in casual restaurants, cabs, Uber, coffee, movies, all that jazz is easy-going. It is very important that you can keep an easy-going mindset. Dating a stressed out, resentful individual is no fun.

Get your studies, jobs, and career in order and get some disposable income. It does not have to be huge; it just need to be ""disposable"", and you know you can dip into it for some fun or chill. If you don't have a job or something that generate enough income to have a disposable income, you are seriously screwed anyway  and need to work on that. Earn more, spend less, save more, all that jazz. I'm not super financially-savvy; if I was, I would have never taken my PhD scholarship (it is practically a 50% pay cut, compared to what I was doing professionally). I took it because I enjoy the work that I do. These days the finance stuff are handled by my wife and I trust her. Some might say: don't trust your wife with money, she may blah blah blah with the savings. If I don't trust someone enough for this, I would have never married one. And if something went wrong, I simply made a bad choice. A fundamentally bad choice can never be remedied by procedures, bureaucracy, and paperworks. You just prolong the inevitable pain and put more stress on yourself. If it fails, it wouldn't have worked out anyway; and sometimes, it is better to fail fast than a long, slow, painful decline.

Really, advice on a social life: find something you can enjoy, and do it with others. Don't do it with the intention of meeting someone; do it because you enjoy it. Enjoy it for a while since after marriage, all that stuff melts away. Once married, if you have time for a group hobby, that time can better be directed to making money. Solo or couple hobby take much less time (that's why I started a herb and vegetable garden; Australia suburb rentals have a lot of space), and you sort of need to keep a grip on your sanity. I am told that children is pretty much the only chance to have make new friends once you are out of college (you know, prenatal classes, new dads meetup groups, Parents-Teacher Association, school working bees, all that jazz). Once you start working, and more or less go steady with someone, you got little energy left. Maybe that's just me, an introvert; I'm also told that extrovert recharge by being around people."
51965,"Hi, I’m still a JC student currently studying for Alevels right now. After seeing all these posts in Uni makes me feel really scared esp abt friendship. I had once envision Uni life is about fun and party nights. 
In my JC, lets call this guy Aug. We kinda fell out and this was because he posted our screenshot conversation on Instagram which is popular among people these days. (Idk? It’s a trend for people to have side account and post whatever shit they want)  I was freaking mad and upset that why the conversation between us had to Be known to other people. Afterwards we are no longer friends. He was once my closest Friend I had made in this batch and I told him I have cried so much because of this. He said I was making myself look like a victim. 
Idk why I was scarred and afraid of opening up to people anymore. Later on, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. This makes it so hard to focus on alevels when he is my freaking classmate. As far as I want to break free from him, most of my social circle involve him. There were days I cried so badly that I could run out of the lecture and just cry. Even my closest Friend could turn my back on me. What’s new right? My grades were all Us for MYE 
I’m so hopeless for Alevels, the chance of getting into NUS seem so small... 
but I just wanna ask, what are thoughts on private or second Instagram account? Is it appropriate to post such things online. 
At same time, I was thinking of leaving Sch after prelims. What are your thoughts on it......

51946,"Dear Sayang.

I know we're not together anymore, and I know you wanted space and time for us to get through this. But I apologise; I need to write this and send it away in deep virtual cyberspace, for myself to heal. 

We had the best time together, and I don't regret loving you and being with you. Although the time we had were short, we had a great run. I enjoyed every moment I was with you, and basking in your stories and rants made me adore your strength, kindness, and love. The love you gave me too was pure and blissful, and I could never yearn for more. The way you stared into my eyes, the way you hold me, how you kissed me; they were always addictive. The more I spent my time with you, the more I see how beautiful you are. And the more I feel that we were right for each other.

But I was blind. I was blind to the gravity of your trepidation about us, especially with our differing levels of affection and faith.  I will always regret that Tuesday night; the night when you realise you were certain that you don't have as much faith in us as me. If I could turn back time and change that, I would. I had wished that with a little hope and faith, we could persevere through together.

Nonetheless, I still hold on to faith; the faith in us, the faith that we will work this out together. I will always be here holding on and hoping for you to come back with that hope, faith, and optimism for us again. This might go against all rationality, but when have our relationship been built on that? ;) We're too different from others to be that pragmatic. That's what made me fall for you in the first place anyway. 

And don't you be afraid to hurt me again. Because you might not; and even if you did, we can say at the end that we tried our best, and we tried it twice. And that's worth trying again.

I will always be here for you, Sayang. I will always care and cherish you as a person, regardless of our state of relationship. Because I know you'd do the same for me. You always have a place in and a piece of my heart.

Loving and missing you always,
Your Tilam

Tl;dr, hit the gym/do some workout that'll enable you to give your 100% and max yourself mentally/physically.
Personally, I hit the road and sprint for like as long and as far as I can. No matter the time. Usually i do it around 10pmish though. For some reason the anger can keep you going when your body feels like it's gonna give up. At the end of it, I feel slightly better so it might work for you.

If there were 2 seaters I'd gladly use those instead, but there aren't :) Who the FUCK in the right mind would ask random strangers ""hey can i sit here??"" if there's an empty table right next to them or nearby LOL.

51927,"i'm a conventionally pretty girl in fass and recently started hanging out with this super cute (maybe just in my eyes) and tall guy about a month plus ago. we meet up occasionally for dates where he acts as if he's my bf and slept with each other a few times already but he never made me feel like a booty call or the like. 

more recently, we have just been sleeping together in the innocent way and i really like it and i'm catching feelings for him. we have never really discussed what exactly is our relationship which is bad, i know but he doesn't like labels. i don't know how to bring it up without making our current fwb (?) situation weird but i really do like him a lot and i guess it just sucks being in an unrequited love.

maybe some of you guys will think that i'm being promiscuous or that i shouldn't be complaining because at i'm at least still having sex with my crush but i'm genuinely unsure of what to do. i never thought that i'll be in the classical fwb but someone catches feeling situation but here i am now"
51924,"@#51914 This has got to be the most dumbest, selfish comment I've ever seen on this site. You think those people even choose to eat alone, huh? And canteens have very very few two or one-seat tables. What the hell is wrong with them choosing whichever empty tables are left (esp. during peak periods)? It's first-come-first-serve.

If you can't find seats for your cliche of self-centered friends, then just ask the loner if you can share the rest of the table. A person sitting alone won't deny others from sitting too. So what's the freaking problem?"

51909,"TIFU

It was raining today around 1.30pm. My friend and I were trying to get to a building somewhere around LT 27 but there was no shelter. The both of us had no umbrellas but my friend had a hoodie. So, I just stood there and a random girl offers to share her umbrella with me. I gladly took up on her offer and walked across with her until we reached the building. It was a short walk but I still felt grateful and touched. 

Now here's where i messed up: I asked where she was going and walked her there but forgot to ask for her name and thank her at the end for that kind deed. Also wanted to treat her to a meal but she had to rush off for a lesson, which was quite unfortunate. Not sexual stereotyping or anything but how often do you see a girl offering a random guy to share an umbrella? I personally see more when its the opposite. Totally wasted a perfect opportunity to get to know a wonderful and kind person. 



TLDR: got stuck in the rain, random girl shared umbrella with me, didn't ask for her name and thank her."
