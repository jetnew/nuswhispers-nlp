57998,"A relationship is supposed to make you feel happy. However, the constant rejection by your crush actually makes you feel sad. The reason you feel sad is that what you like about ""her"" is actually what you like about your imagination of her.

Here is an example: 
You had been chatting with ""your crush"" online happily until one day, you realised that all along, her brother was the one replying the messages. 

All along, you had been feeling happy while chatting with her brother as you thought that you had been chatting with her."
57995,"To the OP of #57945  (I'll assume that you posted this sincerely), if you happen to read the comments on your post, you might find that a lot of them are pretty negative and some are downright misogynistic. I would like to say that they are wrong, but maybe so are you. 

From what I gather from your post, it seems to me that you've locked yourself out from any opportunity for sincere self-reflection and self-improvement. You explain away your lack of relationship success by saying that most men are insecure manchilds who couldn't handle you anyway, and that the women who do get attached only do so because they're traditional types that lowered their standards. But by adopting a view that these problems are ultimately the fault of the world and the people around you (but never of yourself), I think you might have failed to consider that others may have legitimate grievances with your personality and character - things that you should probably work on.

Sure, if they can't handle you at your worst, maybe they don't deserve you at your best. But try getting an abusive father to tell that to his children - this quote obviously isn't an excuse for bad behavior or problematic personality traits, and you certainly shouldn't use it as a way to transfer personal responsibility on improving yourself, into responsibility for others to accept you- nobody has that obligation and nobody is insecure for declining it. Perhaps, instead of  trying to find somebody who can handle you at your worst, you might be better served by making your worst, less so, and your best, better - if not for a relationship, at least for yourself. "
57994,"Social media has given a disproportionately loud voice to the daft and uninformed portion of the population who propagate ill-considered and misguided suggestions as contributions to public discourse.

Policy-makers, administrators and commentators are forced to consider these as legitimate feedback, whereas populist ones take advantage of them to galvanise the population and advance their private interests.

There are two more hard truths for you then:
1) the men who didn't choose you aren't menchilds. They just have better options 
2) we don't eat the oranges we exchange freely with our relatives during CNY, do we? 

The fact that you have to remain anonymous shows that your past is somewhat shameful, even to yourself. But, from the looks of your post you might be too egoistic to understand these. Peace out :)

why egoistic? You and that previous conceited OP are trying to impose the idea that men who don't accept your illustrious past are lousy? We all choose our mates based on our own preference, stop trying to influence others with your decitful and erroneous arguments. "

57979,"In all honesty, I am happy and satisfied with where I am in life now. I've always been interested in Psychology since young. I've never been more passionate about anything else. While my peers are complaining about the heavy content of Psych, I'm just so happy to be able to study the subject. The heavy content doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I want to know more, I want more content.

However, this CNY, the moment I told my relatives that I'm majoring in Psych, I got severely reprimanded. Everyone said that I was being stupid and that I shouldn't have majored in Psych. They even suggested that I witch courses to that are more practical / in demand (i.e. business or CS).

The thing is, I am actually really good at Psych. I truly believe that I am one of those few people that will push through to become a Clinical Psychologist. I have so much faith in myself, yet nobody seems to have faith in me. Apparently, I am the subject of ridicule now among my relatives... And what's ironic is that their children didn't even make it to University... "
57978,"Everyone complaining about relatives asking when you going to get attached etc please tell them it’s better to be single than deal with horrifying parents of your bf/gf?

My mandarin isn’t that good and my pronunciation sucks so I wished her xin nian kuai le in English rather than in my broken Mandarin but she’s mad that I didn’t say more like nian nian you yu etc. Traditional Chinese families, please advise?

57977,"The harsh reality is that students from elite schools are going to have advantages over those in the middle of the curve because they are better at all things that are relevant to academia. 

On average they are more intelligent, resourceful, richer and conscientious- attributes that allowed them to make it through elite education. Sure you can try to point out CMI exceptions here and there but that does not change the big picture that as a group they are better.

Instead of being salty about stuff you can't control like this or believing in fantasies about how to smash elitism, it is more productive to develop yourself to your maximum potential. Be the best you can be.

57973,"To whoever wrote #57901

People like you who give such stupid advice in a bid to make single people feel better are just straight up naive at best or totally blase in privilege at worst. 

The question begged here is, do ""successful"" men (by whatever definition you want to use) finally get life partners because they truly want and love them, or only because of their added material and social value they finally possess? In other words, who they are isn't as important as what's in their wallet, who's on their contact list, or how successful they are in their careers? 

We have a description for such women/men who would go for people with riches and social status when they otherwise wouldn't if such sweeteners didn't exist. They're called gold diggers. 

Also, what the hell is with all the singlehood advice preaching that one should not make someone their mission or goal in life, and instead focus only on themselves and their own desires? There is nothing less valid about someone whose motivation is their partner/potential partner as compared to someone whose motivation is career success, fame or money. All it means is such people have different priorities in life. To such people like myself, family and love and people matter far more than chasing the corporate climb or becoming one of the Who's Who in society. As someone commented, you can be a millionaire and yet still feel like a loser if you're still single, or worse still at that point constantly paranoid that people want you potentially for all the wrong reasons when they wouldn't give you a second glance or a chance before. 

Family matters. Love matters. Having a life partner matters. Stop demonising single people and thinking that them changing their motivations in life is somehow going to make them feel better because you're just taking a crap all over what drives them and what they desire as though it is of less significance than your materialism and thirst for power/fame/social status. 

Just because single people might be used to being single, doesn't mean they necessarily should like it in order to feel better about themselves. I know I'm in no condition or state to be in a relationship now, but it doesn't stop me from wishing that I was. "

57953,"I've moved on in the past few years or so I thought.
From living an empty life - a life where I went about day by day just taking each crashing wave one at a time; Where aimlessness is the only constant; to one where I was able to do well at what I did.

It took me a good amount of time to walk through the wreckage of a failed relationship and, for the most part, you were there, even when I was obviously a burden on you.

There was always one thing that pushed me along and brought a smile to me, particularly when I have had a crazy day. It was always when the chat notification popped up, an Instagram post of your day, or when I catch a glimpse of your smile as you walk past. 

I had never confided in anyone more than I had you. Maybe that was a mistake on my part. I opened up so much to you that I formed too much of an emotional attachment to you. While it can be said that there is some transference of what I imagine the ideal relationship should be, there was no denying that we worked well together, we had similar interests, similar sense of humour, similar thought patterns. We are so similar that you have become the part of me that I love talking to about anything. Maybe it is my perception of you, but you were the one that pointed out our similarities. That’s one thing I know that this is not fully a matter of transference and will make it hard for me to ever get over you.

I felt almost the same pulls on my heart when you told me of your engagement as I did when I first started to feel my own life was going nowhere. I thought that I was going to lose you. You, my anchor in the storm.
I was still happy for you, though it cuts me ever so slightly each time you speak of him, or to see the ring on your finger. Not that I would ever put myself forth as an option. I was a wreck and still not capable of any support you need.

I tried to go about my life without you, and I did get better. Even still, just talking to you puts a silly grin on my face. I still do have little fantasies of us getting together but even there it never lasts, because I know that I cannot be what you need. 

The day would come when you told me of the solemnisation. I knew it was coming before you had even typed those words on your keyboard. I still couldn't be prepared for it, though something about the way you said it made me wonder if that was what you wanted. I didn't dare ask more then because I felt that I might be living a fools' wishful dream that this was not what you wanted and that you wanted out. Despite my other friends saying that I shouldn't ask you about it, I knew I could not bear it if this wasn't something that you wanted - something that would make you happy. I feel of two minds when I see you. I am happy to know that you are happy, but yet I die a little inside knowing that I can't be that one that brings you that happiness. 

I am caught in between a rock and a hard place. Do I bypass the feelings that I have confessed to you and maintain the friendship we have, while I try to heal from the self-inflicted wounds from what would never be; or do I put more distance between us by leaving everything behind and starting afresh elsewhere. 

How I wish I could have been the right person for you. I would still try to be the right person in whatever capacity you need me to be. I take you as my inspiration to move on and free myself from my own shackles. I know it would be a harder road ahead as I know I cannot be reliant on you. What might have been if I had just met you sooner.
I did mean what I said before in that I cannot see myself in any relationship in the future. You have unknowingly set a high bar for anyone that would come along.

I can only wish you happiness and joy, and that if you call me, I will be there for you no matter what. I would never turn you down. You will forever be my friend.
