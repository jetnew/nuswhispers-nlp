54598,there's this guy that i am kind of interested in but he brought up his past such as getting rejected by his crush after confessing... so now i am kind of confused because it seems like he is still living in the past and maybe he is hinting that i should give up on him?? if he is interested shouldn't he not mention other girls that he used to fancy... 
54595,How do guys normally confess to the girls they like? Do you rehearse it and pick an occasion to do so? I am an evergreen and I find it very awkward to confess to girls as I have never done so before.

54568,"In reply to post #54568, 
Honestly, the replies to this post really disgusted me. How can ppl be so unsympathetic towards others, and judge others so quickly? So yes a depressed gf is likely to be portrayed as the victim, but have they considered what it's like to be in the bf's shoes?
.
Recently I've become a close confidant for a friend (A) whose partner (B) suffers from bipolar disorder and depression, and B's disorders are pretty severe. B MUST be around A all the time (I am not exaggerating), and if A is not physically present (bc of class etc), A must continue to be available for B via text, or have a legit reason whereby A cannot use his/her phone (eg exam). After which, A must immediately account back to B to assure B that he/she is not leaving her/him. B also sends A to A's classes, so that they will spend maximum time tgt. To make matters worse, they live together (in hall), so A can't simply lie that he/she is in his/her room when he/she has been going out elsewhere. Why? Because to B, there are only 2 scenarios: A wants me, or A doesn't want me (and hence A chooses other things like listening to lessons or going out with friends, over spending time with me). 
.
I've advised A that it is a seriously toxic relationship. B has become so dependent on A, that whenever A ""disappears"", B does sth rash like cutting him/herself, or threatening to commit suicide.
.
Can you imagine being in the shoes of A? Yes, B needs help, and we offer him/her our sympathy, but who are we to judge A for being a ""bad partner"" bc he/she needs his/her alone time and to have somebody rely on you 24/7 is absolutely mentally taxing? How would you feel if every little action of that you do can potentially cause someone to take their life?
.
A has ever confided to me that he/she has contemplated just letting B take his/her life, because A really cannot deal with the amount of stress B is causing for A. A acknowledged that it is a selfish act, but there are limits to people.
.
So maybe I can't offer a solution to A's and B's problems. But PLEASE be more mindful of the words that you type and speak. You never know what others are going through. 

TLDR: You shouldn't judge the bf so quickly without even knowing his side of the story

(And for those who are curious, B is already seeking treatment for the disorders, but it is not helping.)"
54567,"Hi you,

Remember that time when you asked if we were soulmates because we understood each other so well? My life lit up after so long. 
Remember the last time we went out when you told me you couldn't believe that our mutual friends was still shipping us together? I was caught off guard and I didn't know what to say because I fell for you and ended up staying silent.
Its been a few years since you cut contact abruptly because you didn't like how I became too concerned about something you were coping with and felt that I saw you as a different person. Even though I have tried contacting you multiple times since then, each time you ignored my messages and yet I stayed hopeful that you might contact me someday. But I guess that will never happen anymore since I found out that you have been attached for a few months.

To whoever that wrote this, and many like-minded friends out there, I hope what I am sharing would deter you from this unhealthy path of eating disorders.
I am a recovering anorexic patient who had an eating disorder since I was 13 years old. 
Before everything started, I was an avid swimmer who took part in many youth competitions. I enjoyed sports and being out in the sun with my friends. In my primary 6 report book my teachers wrote: “lively” “sporty” “optimistic”. I had near perfect attendance. It was a really good time for me.
Long story short, I developed an eating disorder in secondary 1 and all the above went away. 
Being anorexic, you will not be truly happy. Yes, maybe temporary satisfaction when you see your weight drop and your bones start to appear visible under your skin. But, you will never ever be skinny enough for your standards. Each time I stood in front of the mirror all I could see was “where else I could loose weight” and not how skinny I was. Almost every moment of your day will be haunted by restricting calories, exercise, and the excruciating hunger that you try so hard to resist. This cycle, once you’re in it, trust me, its not easy getting out. 
If the detrimental mental effects don’t scare you enough, let me tell you the real physical consequence of an eating disorder. 
Gastritis – Really painful stomach aches as gastric acid digests your stomach instead of food.
Gastric reflux – due to long periods of purging after meals, painful as well
Cardiomyopathy – as your heart starts to break down; feeling tired, out of breath all the time
Sadly, these are just some of the few that I can share from my own experience. Just do a quick google search, many more will pop up. Unfortunately, many of these conditions will continue to plague you even after you start eating better. 
I am writing this post because I am starting to really regret having this eating disorder now that I am in uni. Seeing all my hallmates going for training and playing in IHG really made me wish I could join them, but I can’t without gasping for air after just a few minutes of physical activity. A common cold is all that it takes to make my body shut down and send me to the ER. 
So, if you are thinking that its cool being anorexic, it’s not. Being fed with a tube down your nose is not fun. There are healthier ways to get that toned and fit body via eating right and working out. 
For those that are still battling with eating disorders, I wish you all the best. Remember, there is help, you just need to reach out. UHC maybe a good place to start.

54558,How to announce to the class that lecture is cancelled #CS2030
54556,How's the dermatology clinic at NUH? I have a bad acne/pimple on my nose and I have no idea what to do...
54555,"@#54540: I can relate perfectly well to your concern. Truth to be told, I don't think there's such things as real friends anymore the more you move up in life. Especially in uni where everyone can hardly meet due to differing schedules, there's no chances to cultivate meaningful relationships. 

The only true time to cultivate real friends is during pri/sec school when everyone were naive kids who were more expressive with one another. As you move up life, people get more self-conscious. They can hide their feelings better. If they don't like you, they won't talk to you or even start gossiping about you (I mean this especially for girls...). Making real friends is nigh impossible, making 'connections' however, is possible.

In this point in life, there's only two meaningful relationships you can truly have.
One is finding a girlfriend/boyfriend, since in this kind of relationship, both parties have their fair stake in it to commit. 

The other option (which might be controversial), is to join a religious group like a Christian cell group in school. Not trying to promote or anything, but seriously, it's true. Being a religious person myself who goes to these meetings, honestly these are the only people I truly find being legit. They actually show care and concern for you instead of ostracizing whenever it's convenient.   

Sorry, but that's life. Especially in Singapore, most other people just put on fake smiles and fake laughs. This is why you gotta treasure your friendships when you get them. Because after a certain point in life, it's really...too late. "

J2 here, thinking about different uni courses to apply to next year. Would love if any past math majors can tell me some of their experience as well :D.
I'm interested in Math, comp sci/stats as well but mostly math. I know CS is popular and great but I'm wondering if doing a math degree can be equally worthwhile? It may sound like a dumb question, but can studying math (pure/applied) in uni get CS jobs? I want to study math but I don't want to become a teacher, its not really my thing. Also afraid I might end up studying a bunch of theoretical mathematics (which I may want to) just for the sake of it and not find a job that uses them. Essentially, how will the majors (CS/Pure Math/App. Math/Stats) compare?

EDIT: if Math is so versatile, why is the cutoff for CS wayy higher than math?"
54531,"Idk how I ended up like this.
Since I was in primary school, I've been having the problem of being ""outcasted"". Until now, in uni, I have once again felt outcasted by my peers. 
Initially, I thought that I'm just unlucky that people around me just suck. I still remember being outcasted by a group of people simply because one girl disliked me and somehow she convinced others to stay away from me.
I also remember back in JC, some people in my OG also formed their own clique and excluded me. I was quite disappointed then as I had been making efforts to stay close to them.
Now in uni, I realised that some ppl in my OG have been going out together and the OG WA group was dead for quite some time. So I thought probably they had created a WA group and I happen to be not inside. Idk what I have done wrong. I went to lectures with them and lunch afterwards and also stayed back to study with them. 
I do not have any clique of friends to go around with so I have been making efforts to keep close to them. 
I even reflected upon myself but I still couldn't figure out what's the problem. Everyone's impression of me is like ""outgoing"", ""bubbly"", ""sociable"" and some people probably think I'm ""popz"". So I really don't know why I just can't find a group of friends whom I can hang around with.

54530,"Currently I accepted SMU School of Accountancy's offer to enroll in class of 2020. Rejected NTU's Accountancy because thought once (true story) went for this talk conducted by NBS during their open house. They invited an distinguished Alumnus back to share her experience. Must say that she wasn't really much of a speaker and was unable to captivate the crowds. Was very displeased by my experience with NTU. 

I also am currently holding an office post in NS, and found myself dislike working like a horse/cow/computer/dog (yeah you get the idea) on the desk doing repetitive stuff (doing a lot of write-ups, email, data-entry). 

I have a keen interest in Math, not just solving problems, but also proving. Took H3 Math for A levels and must say, though can be discouraging at times, the joy you get from proving a given statement is FANTASTIC!!! 

Okay now, back to the present, I have a University course crisis. Of course I know Accountancy earns you good money, but I want to learn Math for the sake of learning Math (mostly satisfaction from mental vigor). I dont know whether if I will excel further in the pursuit of studying Math in Uni, but would like to get at least a Masters (for bragging). I understand that most Accountancy Grads work like a horse/cow/server/dog at their peak, and personally, after working at a desk job, really find it unsatisfying, though heard in the long term, money is fantastic (and no one really studies till Masters for Accountancy)

My Grades are AAAB/E (e for excellent) H3 Math, Distinction 

If TL;DR, my questions are:

1. What are the career choices (kindly state agencies too) one can have being a Math Major? And of course, estimated salary?

2. Differences between NTU and NUS Math programs?

3. What to expect in the years to come if I study Math (personally may want to focus on Pure Math than other branches of Math)?

4. Should I change my course from Accountancy to Math if I dislike doing repetitive stuff or working on a tight deadline?
