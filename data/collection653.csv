65399,"I'm a student from NUS studying some Engineering stuffs. Few days ago was my crush's birthday. Wanted to wish her Happy Birthday and confess my feelings to her. However, she is attached. I'm really lost, don't know is a good idea to confess or not. And recently she went overseas with her boyfriend for holiday. The thought of it really make me upset as going vacation with your partner confirm there is sex involved.

Should I give up or just confess to her?"
65398,My bf of 5 months has never stayed over at my place. My mum recently asked me to duplicate my keys for my bf - she said it in front of the entire family - and they looked agreeable. Am I losing my 地位 at home? :') FYI my mum have always wanted a son but only had two girls
65396,"What are some high-paying jobs for the best FASS students? I have excellent grades/many awards, but I really have no interest in the anything at all, so I thought I would just go for the highest paying ones. I'm not trying to brag or anything; I genuinely would like advice, thanks!"
65394,"Year 3 FASS girl here... Sometimes if I'm wearing a skirt or a dress I go commando. Would I get into trouble with the school if I'm ever ""caught""? And have you noticed others doing it too?"
65393,I recently got together with a girl. She is a few years older than me but it’s alright. Actually I am the third party and was also part of the reason she broke up with her former bf. I feel very insecure and even demanded her to have a clean cut with her bf and even said i wanted to break up with her if she does not do so. She cried and pleaded me to not break up with her. I am also enlisting  soon and afraid that she will find other guys when I am inside. She said that she will wait for me. What do you guys think of this relationship?
65391,"I am feeling depressed after a certain incident recently. I have been hearing stories of hypocritical people who pretends to be nice in the workplace but I thought they were just the minority. Since it was the holidays, a few of my friends from NS decided to meet up. We also decided to invite one of our officers to join us. This is because we felt that he was the only one that cared about our well-being.However, when we send a him a text via what's app, he just ignored our message without even giving a reply. Initially we thought that it could be because he was busy but after sending a few more messages we still didn't get any reply. It sucks because I'm starting to feel that we were disposable tools that were dumped after 2 years. Even a simple message to decline would be nice. Could all the ""care"" and ""concern"" that he showed us be fake? Was everything was a lie? Of course when I ORDed I wasn't certainly expecting to be in close contact with him but it just sucks to experience the feeling of being tossed aside after being used."
65387,"To that guy who posted about his partner rushing him into marriage coming off a long string of unsuccessful relationships with other people, all your alarm bells should be going off.

Marriage isn't something one rushes into on such short notice, I've seen many break down because of that and it isn't a pretty picture when that happens. 

I won't care to speculate on your partner's motives for trying to rush you, but needless to say most of the possible reasons are not very charitable. The only thing that really remains is for you to take an objective look at the situation and make the best choice for your own interests, not hers. The fact that you instinctively feel something is wrong should cue you that everything is not right.

A happy story for you to chew on however- I have a friend who had an ex of just two months that was already rushing him into BTO and marriage. Same story she had a lot of previous exes and it looked like she just wanted to check out with him because he seemed like the reliable choice. He called it off and good thing because she ""moved on"" and ended up being a train wreck. He dodged a bullet there."
65384,"Have decided to just not go for my Convocation, cause all my friends will not be attending even though i took the time to go for their convocations. Honestly, am like WT* but not gonna be sad about it cause honestly its just a formality and if people don't value me enough to come, its not worth crying over. Dont wanna go for another event where everyone is happy and celebrating except for me."
65383,"Dear SoC profs & module coordinators, is it confirm that CS1010E which is Programming Methodology using Python will be roll out in AY 2019/20 Sem 1? And kindly please increase the module’s capacity as there are some chem eng ppl like me who were unsuccessful in bidding the CS1010E/S modules in the past semesters since we are not required to take it and were not pre-allocated.

65375,"Hi #65256, I feel you. I changed gender from male to female after I was sexually assulted. I could not carry on live my life. Changing sex through operation was like a rebirth for me. I can imagine the mental damage you suffer. My heart is with you."

65371,"I've been in this group of friends for four years now (graduating just now). In my group there is this guy who is really charismatic. For four years I've tried to emulate him (I'm a guy too), but now I think I'm falling for him.

Prior to this, I didn't even know that I was attracted to males, and I don't think I'm bi. I wonder if it's a feeling of romance or whether his personality is just too magnetic. What should I do?!

PS: For the record, he is straight."
65370,"How sustainable is a one-sided RS? I met this guy who has indicated very strong interest in me and try to get me on dates very often, but I am only at most 10% interested in him. Should I just get together with him for the sake of finding a relationship before I graduate, or should I just stay single and wait it out until I find someone I really have interest in?"
65369,"Hi guys i need some tips. Ive been single all my life because when it comes to girls im a coward hahaha! But recently theres this girl i really like and i want to flirt a little with her (because im done being a coward) but im afraid of coming of as 'just being nice' or on the other end, 'a fckin creep'. So i wanted to ask what differentiates being nice, flirty and down right creepy. Really afraid of being creepy as many of my girl friends tell me about guys who creep them out when they try too hard to get them. Thanks!"

65367,My husband has been hinting for weeks that he is interested in a three way with my close friend. I’m very open minded person. But do u guys think it’s appropriate? Or is he trying to get a excuse to have sex with my friend? But then again the thought of it makes me really want to try it out to feel how it’s like. Think YOLO.
65366,"My gf is a nurse. Recently she experienced a needle stick injury, she accidentally pricked herself with a needle used to inject her patient. Obviously there is a very small risk of some infections being transmitted by that needles in such a way. I did my own research online, some websites advices not to engage in sexual activity for 6 months, while others encourage protection to be used during sex in response to this.

Now I’m not sure of which one to follow: abstain or use protection? If I choose the former I don’t think I can tahan so long. But the latter option is more high risk. How?"
65365,Just wondering out of curiosity. Do any of you guys out there shave your facial hair with a pair of scissors instead of a shaver? Cant seem to get used to the raw feeling of a shaver all the time and its pretty embarrassing when others give the judgemental look when they see me using scissors in the toilet in the morning.

65362,"I just realised that my boyfriend earns about 6 times of what I am earning now (ave fresh grad salary). My family is also not very well-to-do. I've been dropping hints of what my parents work as (blue collar job) and he roughly knows how much I earn too. He doesn't seem to mind, but I feel kind of burdened and am afraid that we might not be compatible in terms of our family background and our spending style, and I don't want him to think i am a gold digger, I really love him.

65360,"I think FOMO is pretty much a self-explanatory issue at this point. But just wanna ask as a general question, when you dont drink alcohol because it’s not allowed in your religion, and your friends are all out being crazy, how much are you missing out? 
I’ve never consumed alcohol in my life and sometimes I wonder how different things would pan out for me if I chose to go down that path, considering all the mad experiences people can go through when they indulge, not to mention all the people you get to meet. Obviously I’ve been to bars la but I think everyone can say it’s not the same when you know you’re gonna stay sober the entire night while everyone else loses their grip on reality.
So back to the question: what exactly am I missing out on? I dont ask this cos I’m considering it but because I want to get a quantifier, like what do I sacrifice when I choose not to open the door to that kind of lifestyle.

65356,"Hey everyone, a recent NUS graduate here who's only a few months in my first job and I have something to get off my chest:/

My workplace is a pretty quiet place; I look at four walls around me and talking to people does require a lot of self-initiative on my own part. For the first few months, I thought I was the only new employee before this fellow recent graduate (let's call her X) joined my department. 

My first few meals with X were pretty okay, though I noticed that she's the quiet kind and she isn't a really good texter. Some of the topics that we talked about really struck me deeply on a personal note, but she hasn't been the easiest person to have a conversation with; these conversations not being the smoothest in all honesty. However, I've been struck deeply by her kindness towards strangers (she very often gives money to the old uncles and aunties on wheelchairs without taking their tissue packets without any hesitation) and her own uniqueness and quirkiness; she's a really interesting character and she drew my attention.

The birthday card she gave me a month after, threw me into this deep state of confusion. I'd not received such a card for years; heck, none of my good friends would even consider writing a card for me at all. Despite it being a very simple card with some cute drawings, I was really touched and became extremely keen to know her better on a deeper note. However, she's been very blunt in her refusals when I asked her out at the end of the week on several occasions. It doesn't help that she almost never, never replies me on any sort of chat platform and that we occupy different rooms (her workspace concept is different). And on the few (and fewer) occasions when we actually have lunch, we speak and talk even less. It's incredibly frustrating as a colleague and as a person who wants to know X better; she seems to be now living in her own world and I feel quite torn apart as to what I should do next. She might not be intending this, but I feel that we're becoming strangers, again.

I have to add that I perennially feel bad too; was I too pushy, did I screw up my communications with her, did I talk way too much again and again, and did I make her feel uncomfortable at times? I'm a sucker at communicating anyway:( Having thought that she's at the same lifestage as I am, I thought that we could've built a deeper relationship with each other beyond just mere colleagues. But it's so frustrating when she's not the best in social situations (and awareness even) and that I just don't get her. I can't understand her, yet I still want to and yearn to know her better at a deeper level.

I'm so confused with X, terribly, terribly confused. What's wrong with me, and I wonder, why do I even bother? Am I still screwing up these sort of situations? I don't know anymore, perhaps I'm just wasting my time after all. To X, if you ever figure out who this is and what I'm saying, I just wanted to say that your fellow new colleague here isn't the best in talking either and that he just wants to be on the same wavelength as you.

But I guess, I'll just press F to pay respects to myself.

Oh well :( just wanted to get it off my chest. *shrugs*"
65355,"I am currently in summer exchange with one of my girl best friends. (i am a girl)
Before going on exchange, we get along so well and have been the best of friends. Now her attitude towards has completely changed. We get into many disputes mainly regarding our clashing views on various issues that is caused by our different upbringing. Any advice on how to deal with this? Like how to talk to her and deal with all these issues.

I have other friends but the problem is my flight back is with her and i still see her in class. I hope the friendship will not be ruined because of this summer exchange."

65349,"How do i get my dad to be more responsible with money? Sometimes his actions (or rather, the lack of it) drives my family nuts, to the point that I believe my family will be better off without his existence. 
I don’t come from a well-to-do family. My dad works as a full-time grab driver while my mom works as an admin staff. I have an elder brother (reaching his 30s) who works part time and has no aspirations to seek a stable, full-time career (a story for another day). I take home about 3k a month and gives my parents allowances each. My mom has always been the one managing the bills in the household, making payments and ensuring that the bills don’t accumulate. My dad, however, stays silent when it comes to making payments. My mom does not ask dad directly for money, as she is afraid he will get angry for no reason nor logic (which he does, many times). Once, the electricity bills accumulated beyond 1k, and it was only when the electricity got cut off that I realise the bill had not been paid for several months. When my mom hinted to my dad, he just continued to ignore and played his phone games. On other days, my dad always says he does not have money to buy anything (sometimes even for our dinner, or when the family suggested eating something fancier - e.g. KFC/chili crabs). However, he is ever-ready to fork out money towards things or events that can massage his ego (e.g. relatives’ wedding dinners, friends’ business ventures, friends borrowing money). He doesn’t seem to be able to prioritise paying for what is required first, such as the bills. 
I admit, as an adult who still lives with my parents, I haven’t done my part to actively check if the bills are being paid on time. I hand allowances to parents thinking that a part of it will be used to pay for the bills. 
Time to time, my mom tells me not to get a husband who carries similar characteristics as my dad. This broke me as I’ve always wanted to believe I have a family who can be happy and share about anything under the sun, despite not being well to do. As a family, we don’t share about our feelings, troubles or anything deeper than surface level questions, such as whether we’ve eaten our meals or what we felt like eating. I can’t wait to move out and live just with my mom. I believe our lives will be much better that way."
65347,"How do girls eat desert right after saying they are full??? Like my gf can be asking for ice cream/bingsoo or some other desert immediately after patting her belly and exclaiming, ""I'm soooo full!!"" 101 times in delight. And when the desert is placed infront of her, her eyes would sparkle and then start finishing them within a couple of minutes. Plus she can eat a whole choco cake in a day whenever she craves them like what??? And they don't really gain much weight even so like wow I'm amazed. I simply don't get it. Are all girls like that???"

65341,"Just started on my first job and had a talk with 2 superiors today regarding my work allocation. I was really stressed and nervous even though it was just a casual talk, to the point where I was shaking and my lips was quivering. I couldn’t even form a proper sentence or answer them directly, and my throat area and head felt really tight and “blocked” (not sure how else to describe it better). They are really nice people, and I was also ok talking with them one-on-one during lunch or when we are not talking about work. 

Is this a sign that I have social anxiety? This has actually been going on for a while now, with certain people. How much more severe could it get? :(

I am really worried about tomorrow because I will be working closely with one of my superiors as he will be guiding me. I am scared that I will start shaking again and not be able to respond appropriately... I know that it will take time to overcome this problem (if it can even be overcome), but is there any fast method for me to cope with tomorrow? And how do I deal with this in the long term that would not require a lot of money?

I don't have an infinite budget, would prefer to NOT spend a lot on fashion but I just want to look decently good in public. What do people usually wear

1) to class
2) going out for meals in the canteen 
3) in the hostel 
4) in the hostel maybe meeting friends in their room

I felt your story was quite similar to mine, and I totally agree with your message never be too trusting with others.

I did look for guys for some action during my NS days, probably in what I felt was a way to cope with a sense of despondency and hopelessness, as I didn't have friends or others to count on during that period. I never knew that some were taking pictures only after encounters, but thankfully there was never any of those with my face. This was even when I explicitly requested for no pictures.

Thankfully, at that stage I found new purpose in a new hobby and my social life improved so I never found the need to engage in such activities after that, but to this day I can't believe I was that naive back then and I really regret my decisions. I wish I had the courage to seek help, but I never wanted to show that side of me to anyone, afraid that the few friends and acquaintances I had would leave me and that a record of depression would leave a black mark which could haunt me for life. 

I'm happy to say that this is mostly behind me, I never came out and I've been able to live a normal undergrad life for now. But on some nights I get up in tears, questioning why I made those decisions.

Always err on the side of caution, and don't let others guilt trip you into anything. People respect you more when you stand your ground than if you're a pushover."
65338,Is there an acceptable minimum period of time for one to move on and start looking for other opportunities after a breakup?
65336,"To #65268
I can relate to how you are feeling. I, too, became a person that I'd despise during my pursuit of an impossible (in retrospect) relationship.

The greatest regret I made was thinking that I could change myself to become better and worthy of her. I did everything to make amends, to make things better, to change whatever that was a problem to her. As I've realised by this point, my naive motivation was wrong. I should become a better me for myself, and respect this lady's choice at the end whether this ""new me"" is someone she'd be interested in.

Not gonna go into detail but basically it was a horrible experience. This experienced had caused so much pain and trauma to a point that I had to seek professional psychiatry help to curb my suicidal thoughts. I'm at a way better position psychologically and mentally now but remnants of this past still haunts me. I get into this momentary state of anxiety and panic attacks when I encounter someone with a similar back view, until I take a closer look to make sure that it's not the same person. I happened to be in the same place with this person by chance at an event and I had to immediately dismiss myself after a while because I had difficulty breathing and started to become dizzy upon the sight of her.

The pain is real, the self loathe is very damaging to your body and mental health. Please do seek professional help if you need it. It's going to take some time to find yourself, but just trust that this experience helps you find who you truly are; your values, your mindfulness and what you stand for. It helps make you grow into a better person. It takes some time to heal from it but know what, don’t rush it. I don’t ever want to see that person ever again, not because I hate her but because I don’t think I’m ready to face that person yet at my current mental state. All that said, I’m grateful for this person for breaking me down, to give me a chance to build myself back up bit by bit, and understanding myself better. 

All the best to you OP of #65268, grow to become a better, kinder and more person. And I’m sure someone right would step into your life at some point, but make sure you’re ready for her. :)"
65332,"Hi everyone! I am completing my internship in 2 weeks time. Just wondering, can i ask my supervisor to write me a testimonial about my performance for the internship? Do people do that?"
65330,"I have seen many number of people who join multiple activities in nus. I.e. to say they simultaneously be the exco committee of 7, 8, 9 or even 10 committees. If they want polish their cv, it’s their own taichi. But many of them choose to be snakes, how? They push the workload they are supposed to do to vice directors, fellow committee members or subcommittee members, i.e. to say their “subordinates” or “colleagues”. Some even better, disappear from the event they are in charge of on the day of the event, then take the credit for being the overall IC of the event! Why? Maybe because they cannot cope or they are just free riders. Then they apply for their job with their cv glitters like gold, they take home all the credit. 

I also got a question for any potential employers here, I like to hear your views on this. Do you watch out for these type people? Imagine you encounter interviewee with very thick cv, claims to have participated in many many activities. How you differentiate someone who really contributes properly to all the activities he/she mentioned in the cv, vs those who participate in name only in those activities slacking their way thru, just to get the credit? Or is it common that these ppl can cheat their way thru and we just have to suck thumb on it? Like the saying goes “welcome to the real world”?"
65326,"Update from #65326: I decided to keep the baby since the baby shouldn’t pay the price for the adults’ folly. Meanwhile, I allowed my fiance to stop using condoms now and increased our coitus frequency. I will tell him that I am pregnant after the wedding, but will never tell him who the true father is. Yes the true father is married, so at least another family would be hurt by the truth.

It is selfish of me to do so, but my child needs a loving environment to grow up. I will also bear my fiance at least 2 more children of his if it is any way to make up to him. My punishment is to let the guilt over my first child burn me inside out until the day I take it to my grave.

We should do the same in nus. Makes the cleaner job easier because they have to deal with less urine splashed on the floor. Start by removing the urinals. Next make the cubicle so small that it’s impossible to stand up (and therefore unable to urinate in a standing position), leaving sitting down to urine the only option.

So while I was in America for a brief visit, I had dinner with some locals there. Everything was going great, and that’s when a friend of a friend said this to me -

“So, you are from Singapore right? I heard that everyone in your village knows each other... I mean... as it is just very small?”

- and I didn’t know if it was just the term ‘village’ or just the way he said it, but I felt defensive and surprised, although I tried to play it off while explaining to him what our city-state is really like... He is actually someone who had the reputation of being a really intelligent guy, so I was doubly surprised by this question/assumption he made.

I wish more foreigners would know about Singapore, and all we have achieved. We are a proud, futuristic nation and I daresay a lot better managed through the years with great prospects ahead due to our smart decisions and achievements. That’s all."

As she was about to return my laptop after I came out of the loo, she dropped it. I immediately got triggered and lashed out when i realized that it wasn't working and left her behind despite her continuous apologies. As i got home, it started working again so gave her a call and apologized profusely, telling her that I love her but her clumsiness simply irritates me.
