59498,I am married and have a kid. For past 15 years I worked and paid off the housing loan of my flat while I got my wife to stay at home to take care of our kid. The agreement was once the housing loan was fully paid she would go back to work while I become stay at home dad and do a MSc degree with NUS. Now however my wife is no longer interested in getting back into the workforce. I dont really know what to do now. The initial agreement was struck because my income was in the 5 digit range while hers was in the mid 4 digit range. 
59497,When reading comments in #59447 I realised than men tend to think women are not like that and are pure. There were two women who gave the guy sensible advice. Now this is the exact reason why men are often found guilty of crimes they did not commit against women. As long as it is a man he is automatically assumed to be a predator. 
59495,Would just like some opinions. My bf and I have sex regularly and I would initiate about 50% of the time. I'm worried it'll scare him off as my sexual appetite is quite.......big. Thanks!
59492,"Is it wrong or socially unacceptable to put off sex until after marriage? I have a traditionalist mindset and want to wait for the one that I am determined to spend the rest of my life with, before giving him my virginity.. But it seems like the guys that I have dated so far just wants to get into my pants and even wanted it on the first date. It makes me reconsider that in this modern age, is my mentality really unacceptable?"
59491,"#59491 I'm glad that at least the faculty knows about the state of CS2106. I have more complaints but I'll reserve them for now. What I hope to see improve though would be the quality of the tutorials, especially when the tutorial submissions account for 20% of the grade. The tutorial is vague and ambiguous, making it extremely difficult to answer. Comparing it to the past tutorials, it is world's apart. I struggle to understand what the question is asking of me and it is difficult to draw links to the topics we learn. The ""there are many solutions"" approach because of ""the many implementations"" is a terrible one because it is too generic. I won't even get started on how the tutorial comes as a HTML file with all the HTML tags. While I do appreciate the effort that the prof is taking, with his constant spam emails, I hope that CS2106 can become more substantial with tutorials like that of Uncle Soo? Similar for the past year papers. The only past year paper we have is the one from 2005 and it's also extremely vague and iffy."

59489,"I started working at this company a few weeks ago and I feel as though I were on a completely different frequency from my colleagues. It is hard for me to join in their lunch conversations, either because the topic is not something I am familiar with, or my colleagues just ""talk across me"". Most of the time, lunch passes by without me contributing anything to the conversation. I usually just listen very passively, laughing along with them and nodding along with what they say, in order to not appear disinterested. 

I know I am paid to work and not to chit-chat with colleagues but I do feel a little left out at times and this sometimes affects my mood a little for the day. I never had this problem back in NUS and I am starting to wonder if I will ever be able to click with my colleagues. Has anyone had a similar experience before? "
59488,"Looking for advice.
How do I break up with my girlfriend who hates me so much? Almost every single day, we are quarreling about the past stuff. When we are at a ""peaceful time"", she will want to buy something. I have poured out all my savings for her. When I told her that my bank has reached the minimum balance and have to wait for allowance before I can get her what she wants, she will start a new argument out of nothing. ""don't love her anymore etc"". Am I in the wrong for not satisfying her? Or am I just being used?"

59480,"I am in my third year and I still do not have any close friends. Whenever I see my batch mates hanging out in cliques or even with a friend that they have been with since the first year, I get that indescribable feeling of sadness.  Every friendship lasts only a semester despite the effort I have put into building it. I just want to have someone in the course that I am close with. I have gotten advice on joining a CCA but it did not work out that well in terms of schedule and commitment. I hear in the working world, the chances of forming deep friendships will be impossible and university will be one's last chance.  Has anyone been in my plight and managed to have someone they are close with in their course?"
59479,"to #59479 he sounds like a gold-digging, trophy boyfriend at best. congratulations on dodging a bullet. what are you waiting for? grab this chance to cut him off and make sure it is a clean break.

not to be preachy but if you try to hold him back after he had expressed his desire to leave, the only thing you will get back from him is going to be contempt and pity. if he is not nice to you the best thing to do is break up to liberate both of you - give him the freedom he was asking for and yourself a chance to find someone who is actually right for you. all the best!"
59478,"Good day looking for advice! 

I’m a yr 3 accounting student who prolly won’t ever intern at the big 4 due to circumstances. If I have the chance, I hope to go directly into internal audit in a corporate firm after graduation, without going into big 4 at all, because I just cant take the rigour and prolonged long hours. But I heard that it’s very difficult to change jobs in the future if you don’t have big 4 experience. Is it true? I won’t even have an internship. Seniors who went directly into corporate, do you have any regrets whatsoever? 

Or should I just suck it up and struggle for a year or 2 then leave (it’s virtually impossible for someone like me to last more than 2 years in that environment) 

Anyone knows whom I can approach for advise (like mentors)

Also because whenever you see a beautiful girl out there you will think, he deserves someone like her.

59474,"To those who frequently comment on posts of NUSWhispers (you know who you are):

Please brush up on your English before dropping comments; it is disgusting to see your constant grammatical errors, illogical sentence structures, poor (or even wrong) use of punctuations and contractions. Rather than subjecting the eyes of the general public to your shabby English, your time can be better spent on reading books to improve your command of English.

If you are from NUS (which I highly doubt so), I recommend that you take courses from CELC. Alternatively, there are multiple online applications that can do grammatical checks for you; use them before posting. "

Currently, I have 0 clue what's going on with the module. Everytime i think i get it, when I proceed with my tutorials or past exam questions, i dont know anything. So basically im clueless. Heres a background : This 2000 module has no exam. 4 out 5 tutorials will be graded. I've submitted the first tutorial and i'll probably receive a pass like 50%. I'm on the second tutorial and i think its a gone case. So the other 3 tutorials are key to my results. Question is : Should i drop this module? Retake it in the future.

59463,"I have posted here regarding myself being single for long and not knowing how to fall in love again, after i fell out of love 4 years ago. 

But recently, I finally fell in love again. It's with someone who is totallt different from my ""ideal boyfriend"" description that i shared with everyone whenever they asked me qhat do I look for in my future boyfriend. 

I realised I think too much about wanting to fall in love again that I felt so pathetic when I cant find love. But the truth is, the right person just has not appear yet. It takes time, opportunity and fate to meet the one who will make you fall in love all over again. 

So for those who are still single, stop trying too hard to look for it. Stop over thinking ""does he likes me?"" ""Do i love him?"". Instead, go for it if you feel that thats the one for you. If you never try, you will never know. 

I tried so hard to ""create"" fate by swiping on apps and chat with new people, but eventually, the one i fell in love, is not the one i swipe, its someone who walked passed me on a random afternoon. 

Im finally in love, like been so so so long i felt this way with any guy.

Your university only marginally determines your job placements, the most important component being connections.

After that, everything is determined by connections.

I can't help but feel this sour feeling when I think about it; I just feel like he cheated on me.

He's attached to someone new, has been for a while now. Should I tell her to be careful, given that he tries to appear like a nice guy but honestly is pretty much the worst kind of player you can ask for? Not trying to ruin their relationship, but I don't want to see anyone else hurt by him."

59444,"To #59298: I experienced the problem you do about society hating on ""smart"" girls. My ex used to be one of those men who believed that women should be helping men ""in the background""- we eventually broke up because he would get angry when I did better in school than him or like get on the dean's list and he did not. Even other women think like that, e.g. my grandma would tell me that if I study too hard guys won't like me. To make my ex happy I used pretend to be dumb and not answer stuff when I knew the answer, let him (and other people) explain things to me when I already get it, and hide away any prizes or good grades I got. 

But I've now found a guy who is supportive of me and I feel so much happier and comfortable in my own skin. Seeing the contrast, I now think it's better to be single and wait for someone who is supportive of you, than be attached but have to be someone you are not. Nobody should be rude and stuck up, but there is nothing wrong about being true to yourself and proud of your accomplishments. As long as you know you're not being rude to anybody or of bad character, then there's no reason to hide away your intelligence. If you want to find a guy who is supportive of your intelligence, all the more you shouldn't act dumb to attract the type of guys you are looking for!

If you don't mind acting meek or being deferential that's your choice, but just know that it doesn't have to be the only choice. People of our generation tend to be more modern, and I don't know whether this is true but I noticed that it was better with guys who studied overseas, or guys that appear 'nerdier'? Just try to expand your social circle and be patient. All the best!"

59441,"Dear Prof Ben Leong,

I am facing an existential crisis and sincerely need your advice. It has been affecting me so badly to the point where i am frequently anxious and can no longer focus on my studies.

Fundamentally, I am looking for only 2 things in my career:
1. Work-life balance; Family comes, always.
2. Contributing to society.

59436,"Hi,
English is not my native language, but I will try posting this because I cannot take it.  I stay in PGP, and I am posting this here because the management still has not addressed our concerns despite our emails and writeins. As of this week, they have started locking up the seminar and study rooms after 11pm. We were not told or warned of this change, and it is very insensitive considering that now is the exam period. Me and my friends are left frustrated. Considering we pay hostel fees, and it seems inappropriate to revoke our rights to the facilities midway through the semester without any equal refund. This is not even the policy of any other residence, who locks up their study facilities right around exam period? (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). And by posting here, I hope that the management will realize that it is a big issue for us students and reverse their decision. Thank you very much."
59433,"Just to add on to the smart girl saga. Frankly, it's obvious that Singapore society values intelligence over hard work. An example of this is closet muggers, who study for hours yet pretend not to have studied, all to give the impression that they breezed through exams on intelligence alone. And lots of people hate these closet muggers, but there's still a lot of them regardless.

Given this culture, I don't think that it's silly for the OP to feel angry at having her results attributed to hard work instead of intelligence. Yes, from a purely logical perspective there's nothing to take offence at, but from an emotional and societal perspective it feels like someone telling you ""oh, you're not pretty, but you're good at putting on make-up"". In the context of intelligence being more valued, it's denigrating her by straight out saying she's less intelligent and also saying that she's faking it in a sense. (Which I think also leads to higher incidences of impostor syndrome among girls).

On to the advice given. Here, the attractiveness analogy is again useful; telling her to value hard work instead or up her EQ, is like telling an ugly girl that ""looks aren't everything"" and ""oh, you need to try harder to find friends who treasure you for what's on the inside"". On one hand, this is correct, but on the other hand ... is it useful, or going to make her feel better? Yes society is toxic for over-valuing these things, and yes the way to cope is by altering one's mentality and values, but it's an uphill task, and such comments while well-intentioned do very little to help. Not to mention, implying that she's an arrogant bitch and that's the reason she can't find friends.

Fundamentally, the whole post is about sexism as it applies to intelligence vs hard work. Which is why I think the commenters telling her to stop identifying as a smart girl as just reflecting this phenomena. I've known literally dozens of guys whose main self-identified trait was smartness (and only some of whom were neckbeard-types), yet no one has ever told these guys that it isn't good to identify as smart. I guess the OP does sound arrogant by talking about ""guys who won't get all weird about me"" and her academic achievements, but if the post was truly about bragging, would she mention crying for a whole day?

Anyway, that's all I have to say. I've encountered a lot of what the OP talked about in my schooling and career, so it really struck a chord. I like to think that I've made my peace with it, but I wanted to add my two cents for other girls who are still going through it. I didn't have any of the problems she talked about in dating, but that's one area in which being gay helps :)"
59432,"As someone who was single for a long time before getting into a relationship recently, I just want to say people should not spreading the idea that ‘people need love, that it’s a natural instinct for humans to find/ want to be with someone’.

It was so horribly pressurising to hear as a single person because you’re made to feel like you have to find the one (whether you want to or not). I hear it so often now and it still grated on my nerves. I was happy being single, it was just everyone else who didn’t seem to think I could be. 

I don’t think dating someone fulfilled any natural desire for love within me. It just relieved a lot of societal pressure (not saying I don’t like/ love my partner, I do)."

59427,"I'm an introvert. After a long day of work, all I want to do is go home and have some peace from the world outside. But when I am home, my family members will try to have small talks with me. But I will be too tired and sound very annoyed when they talk to me, which is bad :( I know I should count my blessings that I have a family that communicates with one another but I am really tired of interactions after a long day (even though my job scope does not involve a lot of talking). I do not have my own room to retreat into, and my computer desk is in the living room (where I spend most of my time after work). I will listen to music but it does not help sometimes where they try to talk to me even when I am on my earpiece.

I used to be a hall phantom and was totally okay being alone most of the times in hall. I'm also okay eating alone, going lectures alone. I can also go on a day without talking. But there's only one exception, I am quite chatty when I'm with my close friends or my boyfriend.

Our relationship has been platonic since the very beginning. Conversations with her were easy and we could talk about anything and everything under the sun.

Never have I shared my joys and sorrows with someone who seems to connect so well with me. Never have I felt this warm and fuzzy feeling everytime I see her face...

In the past couple of years, I started taking meds prescribed by my doctor for depression. However, one side effect of this medication is that it makes one gain weight. I know of friends who are on the same kind of medication and it was true for them. In the past 2 years, my weight jumped from 60kg to 89kg in December last year. I no longer dare to weigh myself but I know that I’m still gaining because I can no longer fit into a lot of my clothes. Even when I want to buy new ones, they’re not available. I’ve been trying to exercise but to no avail. When my friends jokingly say that I have to do something about my weight, I will laugh along with them to alleviate the awkward atmosphere/tension.

And I feel like it’s such a stupid reason to tell people - “oh I can’t go for CCA because I think I can’t fit into that shirt”"

I have a really good bf and he's studying medicine. He's a great guy, really considerate and respectful. However, every time we are about to ""do the deed"", he seems to be more interested in lying me down and using me for his anatomy comparison (no joke he has his textbook nearby). Then he goes on to say unknown words like ""labia majora"" and ""labia minora"" while just looking back and forth from me to his textbook. Is there a problem here, or am I just overthinking this:/
