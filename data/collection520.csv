Just saw this weird guy looking at me in lab. I am sure I did not dress skimpily or act in a slutty manner. According to my friend, he has been staring at me since lab session 1! I don’t know much about him but I am pretty uncomfortable. The only thing I know is that he wears a IHG shirt. "

I see friends finishing up their readings and I can barely pay attention to readings for more than 5 minutes when a year ago I was able to mug for 3 hours straight. I tried turning off my phone/wifi etc and remove all distractions but then I end up distracting myself looking out the window or sleeping just to procrastinate my work. It doesn't help that I have no idea what I want to major in (I wanted English lit, but I'm taking the exposure mod and now I'm unsure :/) and every time I look at my work, a part of me is ""what the hell is the point?!"" I don't want to mug anymore. I'm tired of this vicious cycle of chasing some mythical idea of success, falling short, and feeling disappointed and angry at myself. I'm worried that if I already feel so unmotivated 3 weeks in what will I be like 3 years in? 

And I hate that so many people from my secondary school/JC ended up here. Don't get me wrong, there are friends that I love and care for from these schools, but it's frustrating that I'm always up against the same people and constantly feeling inadequate to these scholars and geniuses. I know it's a bit odd, but I miss my job, I miss the colleagues I spent the past 6 months with. It was the happiest I ever was in a long time and my job environment really helped me recover mentally, I wonder if it was because most of my colleagues were poly grads and it really was a different culture. It feels like I might never feel like I belong here. It's as if I'm voluntarily jumping off the edge of a cliff just for the sake of a degree and I'm just asking for a relapse.

The university system(s) is(are) both elitist and meritocratic. It's definitely not ""democratic"". Besides, why would you actually want it to be democratic. After all, billions of fundings from tax payers' money and future generation's public debt are poured into us doing (somewhat) pointless researches that one day (may)be applicable to solve real world problems. Even if it's absolutely pointless, because it is public funding, universities are absolutely required to get the best people they could.

Basic research grants are like: ""yeah studying this ancient bacteria genome can give us an understanding to treat cancer maybe?"" Is it a racket? maybe, maybe not. If you think that it is, why are you in NUS studying for a degree? My tuition loan debt is 40k, if I just put that in an indexed fund at 5% a year, I would've had 56k right now. Instead I had to work to pay off that 40k plus interest. Fun, right? Why don't you drop out right now?"

And as we confessed to each other I thought to myself, this must be what happiness is.

As well as to celebrate her achievements.
I have never cared for someone as much as I cared for her.
I put her needs above my own.

52027,"I am from a poor family. My parents are both cleaners, and combined have an income of less than $4500 per month. This was much worse when I was younger. I can’t recall the exact amount, but I think my Mother earned a meagre salary of some $800 per month when I was in primary school.

Background story: My parents worked the whole week when I was in primary school so they asked my aunt to take care of my meals and stuff. Everyday after school, I’d go to her house where my cousin and I would do our homework together etc. My cousin is 8 years older than me, lesbian, and (I highly suspect) is a paedophile. She used to tell me how this kid was pretty and that kid was hot. And by kid, I mean real, primary school kids.

I was at the age of puberty (about 10 years old) and it was then that I starting developing breasts. She was 18. I recall she’d always make me shower with her and touch me inappropriately at my thighs and near to my privates. She molested me. I can saw this without choking up now, but she molested me. She saw that I was vulnerable to exploitation and she took her chance. She touched me as though my body was hers. This went on for months until I finally couldn’t take it anymore. And before you guys question me as to why I chose to keep quiet, my mom was very close to her sister, and this aunt was the only person that didn’t cut my mom out because she was poor. I kept quiet out of consideration. 

This whole molest thing eventually blew up and everyone at the maternal side of the family heard of it. The funny things is, when I finally told my mom, I thought she’d fight for me. But no, she didn’t. She was asked to clarify this infront of the family and she blatantly lied - she denied everything that ever happened to me. She even went as far as to say I lied for attention. It was later then that I found out that she took money from my aunt. We were in debt then, and so she didn’t even hesitate before selling me and my innocence to my aunt.

Because of this, I become very sensitive to touch. You know how some close friends would hook hands and stuff in jc? I couldn’t even do that. Natural things like hooking hands with your close friend made me break out in cold sweat. What my cousin did to me, and what my mom chose to hide, really screwed me up from inside out. I never got an apology from my cousin or anyone else who took her side, but instead got named as a liar and shunned by everybody. Even till now, I am an outcast at the maternal side of my family when I was the one who was wronged and done a great injustice.

Fast forward 9 years, I had (almost) forgotten about the incident. Everything’s a clean slate in uni and I finally started to forgive my mom. I never went as far as to openly rebel against her but for as long as I could remember, I always held a certain disdain towards my mom. To some extent, I think I resented her. I thought I could leave this all behind until I ran into my cousin last week. All my repressed emotions and memories just came rushing back to me.

She was still like before, unapologetic and smug. All this is old news, and I wasn’t really affected by it. I think at some point, I stopped waiting for an apology. What really upset me this time is that she has become a teacher now. I cannot help but to think that she’s in an environment now where there are countless children waiting to fall victim to her ruse. The school system provides her with the opportunity to prey on as many kids as she wants. She is a predator. I say this because she was 18 when she did what she did to me. At 18, I’m sure she knew right from wrong. I’m sure she knew, no matter what, she shouldn’t have preyed on the 10-year-old me. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never reported this to the police, but I’m concerned that she might try to violate her students. Actually, I’m not concerned- rather, I’m sure that one day, she’d violate one of the students. I say this with absolute certainty. I’m so afraid to speak ip because the last time I did, the tables turned on me. What should I do?"

If it was that easy to cope with depression, manifestations of this mental illness in terms of suicide and self-harm will not be rampant. 

Depression isn't about seeking attention from others. It doesn't come from a place of selfishness. On the contrary, it makes you want to shield everyone out. Nobody loves you. Nobody cares about you. Nobody wants you. The voice repeats itself like a broken recorder.

52009,"To #52002:
If there is one thing you should NEVER forgive your SO for, it’s cheating, be it emotional or physical. 
Let me share my story, the same thing actually happened to me with my then bf of 3+ years. He cheated on me once and I forgave him, but I never felt the same from then on - always insecure, always afraid that history would repeat itself. About a year after we patched up, he started getting cold and distant, and I noticed him spending more time on the phone when we’re together. When I questioned him, he held me tight, looked into my eyes and told me he would never cheat on me ever again and he’s working hard to save up for our future. He said he’s sure I was the one for him, we even discussed about marriage and BTO. Just few weeks later, my friend caught him active on Tinder, responding to requests for drinks and one night stands (purposely asked my friend to chat him up to see how far he would go). Long story short, after much drama and tears on my end, he admitted to sleeping around while we’re together. Those times he said he was “busy”, he was apparently “busy” entertaining those girls he barely knew. We later found out that he even contracted an STD from one of those encounters and unknowingly passed it to me, which explains the very painful menstrual cramps I had been having while we’re together. Although the illness was curable, the experience has scarred me emotionally. 
My ex still had the guts to ask me how I felt about all these. I told him it’s excruciatingly painful, as if someone was stabbing me with a knife repeatedly and it hurt so bad I wanted to die, but I couldn’t die...I was seriously appalled at how this guy could look me in the eye and tell me outright lies and empty promises. 
Fast forward half a year later, I still feel jaded when I’m reminded of him, but I guess I’m better off now, as I don’t have to worry about him hurting me ever again. I’m free of anger and emotional pain, and no more lonely nights crying myself to sleep wondering if he still loved me. I’m now trying to focus my energy on building my career, pursuing my hobbies, learning new things and catching up with friends who truly care about me. Basically, my goal now is to become a better version of myself when the right one comes along. 
It’s not gonna be easy, but I hope one day you’ll muster enough courage to leave this person. Believe me, you’ll be surprised of how happy and relieved you’ll feel after that. "

Not saying that I want to reconnect with him again "
52003,"I was good friends with my long lost primary school friend. We lost touch after pri sch and reconnected again after uni, we both went to NUS and we are both females. We talked about everything and shared our joys and sorrows. Our career, our lack of love life and problems of our day to day activities. 

But what bothered me was her making use of me all the time. During outings we often split the bill and she will pay less. She always wants to go to restaurants and orders the more expensive dishes. I just kept quiet about it. She also eats more than her share during these outings. But i kept quiet because why make it awkward? I was unemployed for a period of time and she was working for an MNC. You would have thought she would split the bill equally. Nope. She paid less and ate more. Even to the last dumpling. She would also cancel on our outings at the last min or postpone to her own timing. She would give excuses like her dog has to go vet appointment (already planned) or that her granny had to see a specialist (also already booked beforehand). These are not emergencies that suddenly happened. These were appt dates she already knew before our outing. But I believed her and just let her cancel on me at the last min. 

Once she had to fly to Japan for a work trip. She kept telling me the day and time so i figured it would mean she wanted me to send her off. I was being nice and even reminded her to pack some warm clothes or gloves. She said she did not have gloves and also ""forgot"" to buy toothpaste and toothbrush. So being nice and worried for her that she has no time, I bought them for her and even lent her my favourite pair of gloves. At the airport, late at night, i sent her off and passed her the items. Her parents were there too but even though they each had their own cars (benz), none of them bothered to drive her to get those items. She also has a maid whom she tells everyone is her butler, creating the impression that she is ""rich"". But her maid has also never bothered to help her buy the items she needed for the trip. I took the mrt all the way from the other end of the mrt line to changi airport for her and later had to take a taxi home because it was too late at night, mrt ended. Her parents also never bothered to give me a lift or somewhere near. We all live around the same area.

When she came back from her Japan work trip about 2 weeks later, she would complain to me about how her team mates treated her. They were quite bitchy and rude to her and were fed up with her. I listened and consoled her. Then she tells me she bought a lot of biscuits and tibits from Japan for her other colleagues in Singapore. In fact she bought for the whole department. I asked why she had to buy for the whole department (her dep quite a lot of people like 20 over). She said that this is a culture in japan that we must return their niceness and help rendered as working colleagues. Ok so she does understand what it means to be grateful. But did she buy me anything for what i have helped her? No she did not. Nothing. 

Come on. It is not like i wanted anything expensive. Even if she threw me a slice of biscuit or a sweet from her colleagues' presents i would be happy because that meant she thought of me. But nope. She NEVER thought of me at all as her friend who have been helping her. She also never returned my favourite pair of gloves or even talked about it. Like it NEVER existed. 

There were many selfish instances that happened during those years of friendship and we drifted apart because i knew she was so selfish. She was also very 2 faced because she hates this girl colleague to the core, but continues to hang out like best friends with her. I asked her why do that and she said it was just for show. I found it hard to believe you would date your enemy out for lunch AND dinner AND even on weekend outings, and yet hate her so much. Like what? Another case in point. Her family is in a mess. Her dad and mum are not on good terms. But she is always portraying a happy family and how blissful her parents are in photos and how she admires them and whatever. She also found a boyfriend and in the end ignored our friendship. 

One day out of the blue she started asking about our primary school friends- people whom i have kept in touch with but she had not. I found it strange and then slowly she revealed that she was getting married and she wanted to know if i was still in touch with them. My guess was that she wanted to invite them to her wedding (thick skin much?). Then she asked me if i wanted to come for her wedding dinner. This was after not talking or messaging me for about 2.5 years. And i was always the one having to initiate a conversation just to maintain the friendship. 

So she wanted to make use of me another time to help pay for ang bao? I ignored her and have cut off any conversation with her since then. My point is, when she reads this, i hope she understands why i ignored her. I was sincere in our friendship but she treated me like rubbish.

If there is one thing you should NEVER forgive your SO for, it’s cheating, be it emotional or physical. 
Let me share my story, the same thing actually happened to me with my then bf of 3+ years. He cheated on me once and I forgave him, but I never felt the same from then on - always insecure, always afraid that history would repeat itself. About a year after we patched up, he started getting cold and distant, and I noticed him spending more time on the phone when we’re together. When I questioned him, he held me tight, looked into my eyes and told me he would never cheat on me ever again and he’s working hard to save up for our future. He said he’s sure I was the one for him, we even discussed about marriage and BTO. Just few weeks later, my friend caught him active on Tinder, responding to requests for drinks and one night stands (purposely asked my friend to chat him up to see how far he would go). Long story short, after much drama and tears on my end, he admitted to sleeping around while we’re together. Those times he said he was “busy”, he was apparently “busy” entertaining those girls he barely knew. We later found out that he even contracted an STD from one of those encounters and unknowingly passed it to me, which explains the very painful menstrual cramps I had been having while we’re together. Although the illness was curable, the experience has scarred me emotionally. 
My ex still had the guts to ask me how I felt about all these. I told him it’s excruciatingly painful, as if someone was stabbing me with a knife repeatedly and it hurt so bad I wanted to die, but I couldn’t die...I was seriously appalled at how this guy could look me in the eye and tell me outright lies and empty promises. 
Fast forward half a year later, I still feel jaded when I’m reminded of him, but I guess I’m better off now, as I don’t have to worry about him hurting me ever again. I’m free of anger and emotional pain, and no more lonely nights crying myself to sleep wondering if he still loved me. I’m now trying to focus my energy on building my career, pursuing my hobbies, learning new things and catching up with friends who truly care about me. Basically, my goal now is to become a better version of myself when the right one comes along. 
It’s not gonna be easy, but I hope one day you’ll muster enough courage to leave this person. Believe me, you’ll be surprised of how happy and relieved you’ll feel after that. "
52001,"It's been a long while. Still, whenever I coincidentally saw his name on others' social media, I can't help but to feel damn annoyed. 

I ended a suffocating relationship prior, and gladly embarked on my exchange with my new found freedom. There, I met this fellow singaporean exchanger. Initially, I thought lucky me to have found a good platonic friend on exchange, but turns out that is the start of my nightmare. He made used of my empathy through his pitiful dumped-by-ex story to get physically closer to me. He did many romantic gestures and gradually crumbled my fort. We held hands, kissed and he even promised to bring me out on a proper date when we return. 

But guess what, he blocked me off all social media avenues right after returning back to Sg (no, I wasn't being clingy by any means). I was used like a puppet to fill his lonely void and to satisfy his needs for a companion overseas. Being in a foreign place and having just broke up, my mind wasn't functioning logically (or at least that's the excuse I'd give myself for being so naive). I felt so angry at myself for falling into such a trap and for investing emotionally into this. What's wose, I heard from my acquaintance afterwards that he is the sort who ""can't keep his hand to himself"".

I know he's kind of popular in his social/dance circle (ohh i am so tempted to name the dance style because it is rather distinct), but honestly, he does not deserve all this happiness and popularity. I hope that people will eventually see through his fake mask and that no other girls will end up getting cheated. If I ever meet him along the corridor, I am so gonna roll my eyes at him. 

It is time to let go of my grudge but before that, i'd like to say

TL, karma's a bitch. You better watch out."
