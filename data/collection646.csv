64697,How easy or difficult is it to become air cabin crew in Singapore? I always heard that they earn over 10k a month. It surprise me when I google it and it says average 3500 per mth? Anyone has a clear idea of it? Might consider air cabin crew after I graduate.
64696,"Hi guys I'm asking for advice would Prof Ben or someone help me with it ? This is a legitimate and sincere question so I hope admin post it please.
So I am a PES F guy ( I have Asperger's Syndrome, ADHD and GaD ) and I applied for NUS CS and got offered that this year. I had went to NUS UHC for a medical checkup and the medical doctor who was very unfriendly asked me to schedule another appointment with the NUS psychiatrist to "" clear up any residual problems "" I feel quite shocked and worried about why I needed to do that. Honestly, I'm feeling very anxious as I really want to be assessed as "" fit to study "" by NUS. I note that NUS medical exam is to assess whether a student is fit to study in the university and I'm feeling very scared that I may be unqualified. Would Prof Ben pls give some advice ? Thanks in advance!! :)"
64694,"Year 4 student next AY here, currently panicking about honours thesis. Had approached a prof last sem who said she can only decide in June. I knew it was risky af cause June is damn late but I decided to take the risk cause I like her research area. Thought worst come to worst even if she cannot take me, I can just write in to get assigned to whatever other prof available (as indicated/implied on the ""Information on Honours Thesis"" on the department website). 

Now it's June and it's been almost 2 weeks since I sent prof my details she asked for and haven't gotten a reply. Today just got an email from the honours thesis coordinator who I emailed just in case saying that the HT is not an assignment that is given to you and that I should probably make other plans if my prof doesn't take me. Maybe it is premature to panic since there is still a chance my prof will take me but it has been almost 2 weeks... 

But anyway I NEED to do an honours thesis because I intend to pursue further studies. Currently thinking about taking LOA and secure a honours thesis supervisor for the next sem/year. This is pretty much just a rant at this point but any advice is welcome."
64688,"Need some advice here. I have a NUS degree and have been working for 2 years and I intend to do a Masters in Engineering. I've been offered a place both in NUS and a US university for a similar course. The US university gives a partial scholarship and the fees in the end are about 20% higher than in NUS. The university is ranked lower than NUS. Some people have recommended me to go overseas for the experience and exposure but I don't know how well employers view overseas Masters degrees in this subject. If I go NUS, I can take the degree part time and continue work and receive salary but I am not sure it is possible in the US."
64687,"Given that nus is at the forefront of adoption of many new ideas, from cashless payment to banning plastic straws to trialing grab scooters, I think there’s another idea they should implement too.

They should ensure and enforce that every student downloads the sg secure app on their phones. It will send a strong message that total defence is the responsibility of every individual, and keep us prepared if something undesirable were to happen (touch wood).

Given that the previous initiatives have been successful, I’m confident that if the same thing were to be applied to the sg secure app downloads, it will be well received by the student populations and make the intent of sg campaign a huge success."
64685,"I am a female student who is wondering what to do after my graduation in a years plus time. There isn’t many jobs I am interested in to be honest. But I am rather interested in becoming a detective. The thing is how well is the prospect of being a private detective in Singapore in todays day and age? Another thing I am really curious about is - How do they market themselves since they are supposed to be PRIVATE detectives (in the sense that if the marketing strategy is too successfully, it might attract attention from the targets of investigations). On another hand, I consider joining SPF and getting into the CID team, which gives one more stable income and workplace development. Anyone knows any female in the SPF who can give some advice? Do females go through the same training as guys during their ns days? Meaning bmt training at tekong? From what I understand, to be eligible, one has to pass the ippt test. Is it still possible to join if one could not clear all 3 stations for the ippt test? Also, how does the arrangement for units work? Can one choose, for instance, to specialise in the CID investigation team? Or do everyone have to be rotated around the units? Anyone can give advice about signing on as a female police or as a police in general? All inputs would be greatly appreciated!"
64684,"My older brother is a regular officer in the army. From observing the way he does things, there are three main rules that I adopted, and believe everyone should adopt in their daily life. These points are very applicable to uni life, I find:

1) Ensure everyone can hear you when giving a presentation. That’s why I always ask “last men (or women) can hear me?” before starting a presentation. This includes presentation for projects in uni. Remember, communication is key.

2) 
a) Your superior (or boss) is always right. Obviously don’t take this phrase at face value. What I mean is that your superior’s aim should always be to achieve certain goals for the team, for them to succeed. You may disagree about the methods, but the ultimate aim is always correct and undebatable.
b) If you think your superior (or boss) is wrong, refer to (a).
This applies to working under your various directors of various committees in uni.

3) Discipline is key. Without discipline, you cannot keep yourself and your team on track to reach your goal. Sometimes occasionally in civilian setting it may therefore be useful to carry a knock it down to drill the message into our heads.
This is important in studying well and achieving good grades.

Obviously the army does have it’s dark side, but we should complain less and always be positive about everything (including the army) to succeed."
64683,"After seeing so many guys post about not having a girlfriend and some being salty over, here's my two cents on this topic.

Sg girls are materialistic? Hell, with Singapore's living standards, who wouldn't want a richer bf/husband? 

Princess syndrome? If we made it to uni, I'm sure we should have enough ability to support ourselves in the future, even if single. So why the need to find a boyfriend or husband and needing to burden ourselves with caring for a family while working (which, as mentioned, Singapore cost of living so high, unless husband rich enough to support family, wives need to work also) With these considerations, the female will want to find a guy to ""pamper"" her.

Of course, there is a certain extent to how much princess syndrome should be tolerated, and my views are not representative of every female. 

My point is: 1.higher requirements for bf/husband considering the extra burden in the future 2. Pls, guys, take a look at urselves too, so many manchilds and immature guys whose egos are inflated... what do you think u can offer in a relationship?

-a pragmatic female who is not interested in a relationship"
64676,"All this talk about how Sg girls are ugly, have princess syndrome, have high demands etc... Turn the tables then. Guys here aren't handsome, also have high demands (e.g. want girls to be baby incubators for them, want dick sucking even though they don't wash under their smelly foreskin, expect you to always be their slave...), some are stupid af / have no high qualifications and expect you to be the one to do everything.  So reflect first before you start saying that sg girls suck."
64675,are feelings for a person caused by one's pure interest in them? or are they actually spurred on by what the other person does/reacts/responds favorably? sorry for the complicated qn but i think its how some people begin to get led on
64670,"Prof Ben, do you have any opinions on industrial CS PhD programmes  partnered with Chinese companies like Alibaba and SenseTime? Are they better than the standard CS PhD programmes?"
64668,"what's the diff btwn love and obsession? or are they not mutually exclusive. what i am feeling now is a strong desire to be with that person every moment, and in the long-term, but i am not sure if it's just an unhealthy obsession that has entered my life."
64666,"Hi Prof Ben, regarding your advice to pursue a career in Chinese tech companies, noticed you mentioned that companies like Alibaba and bytedance are recommended but not for Baidu. Is there something wrong with the work culture or management that makes working at Baidu not recommended? Thanks!"
64665,"Chemistry graduate from Singapore. What can you do as a job if you really love makeup? I love following makeup trends, love putting on makeup and hoarding makeup. I tried to look for cosmetics chemist role but i dont meet the criteria or there arent a lot in Singapore? What do I do? I feel tired and upset working in an office job now."
64659,Is it advisable to go for Uni course camps? Please kindly give your feedback! Thanks!
64658,"Hi everyone. I am a NUS FCH graduate and has been through 4 years of education here. In hindsight, I feel that I was too fixated on my CAP so much so that I neglected proper learning. At the end of my 4 years FCH pursuit , I asked myself: ""What have I learnt that could value-add the society and companies?"" and I could barely come up with any answers. 

This goes out to all undergraduate: CAP IS JUST A NUMBER; **what truly matters is how much knowledge you have GAINED throughout. After all, the PURPOSE of a university education is to LEARN**

(So please do enroll in ""difficult"" but enlightening modules like programming and what not, NOT ""easy"" but fluffy modules to pull your CAP up. In other words, don't end up like me..)"
64656,"What makes it so hard to get over someone even after a long time? I’ve already tried a new sport, going out on new dates, changing jobs etc, but it doesn’t really help."
64654,"I don’t know if I should break up with my girlfriend. We had lots of wonderful memories together. The fear of losing her, losing these memories and the fear of being single have led me into compromising many things in our relationship"
64652,"What’s up with those people who post every single day about nothing but their gf on Instagram? I swear if I open up his profile, every single post has his gf in it, nothing else. Every single insta story has is gf in it, 5 to 10 stories a day. Honestly do you think other people will really be so interested in your r/s to such a extent?

Also it’s very triggering to those of us who are single. I know it your right to decide what to post and freedom of speech is your right, but can you at least show some sensitivity?"
64650,What is the general perception towards girls (guys) who ships guys (girls) together?
64647,"Just my 2 cents worth of thoughts. 

Getting into NUS is already top 20% where academic results are concerned

Staying in a private property is also top 20% in terms of housing assets

Having a 5k income may or may not be top 20% for a fresh grad

But all these details about me will never be shown on my dating profile. I’m not trying to find a sugar baby. How then do I find someone who is 门当户对 , compatible in status, lifestyle etc?"
64646,Is it love when you always feel not enough for the person and always scared of losing him?
64645,"Gentlemen, if you want to play tinder, make sure you follow 2 rules: 

1. Be good-looking
2. Don't be ugly

If you can't follow both rules, don't complain and be salty that you can't get matches."
64641,Is it worth still trying to win over someone that hasn’t outrightly  ‘rejected’ me before but has stayed silent and avoid this all the time since my feelings were out? I have tried many indirect methods to reach out to this person but not sure if they really work.
64640,"Hi Professor Ben, do you advise your students to join local banks like DBS, UOB or OCBC? Heard the tech culture in local banks is terrible compare to FAANG."

Well, maybe because your dad alone earns more than my parents do combined together. Your house alone has more money than my ancestors combined. Or maybe because your trust fund is worth more than what I earn in five years. Maybe because I have to work just to get to your starting point, so you don't have to care. But I do."
64637,"Hi CS/CEG seniors,

      I would say that my communication and presentation skills are below average. How easy/hard would it be to get atleast a 'C' in CS2101.

Thanks in advance."
64635,"Hello Prof Ben, I would like to seek some advice from you. I met a senior from computing who is a lot older than me and we have always been quite close where we will chat every single day and we will occasionally meet up for meals and movies (just 2 of us despite having common friends). He always praise me, saying that I’m very pretty and chio etc, sometimes flirting with me. But we have been in this situation for about 3 years and he doesn’t have any further action. I’m not sure if he is does that to other girls as well. From the point of view of a guy, does it mean that he is not interested in me and it’s just one sided? Am I very stupid hoping that one day he will confess to me? Should I actually stop this entire joke and move on with my life?"
64633,"My fiancé is 35 years old this year. We’re thinking of getting our wedding done soon, but have financial issues. Also objections from my family. I’ll only graduate next year. What can I do? I really love him and can’t afford to let him go. And how to convince my family?"
64632,"Prof Ben or anyone, can I ask for a piece of advice.

Would you recommend someone to include in his CV about all his research internship experiences. The thing is, I had an experience where the supervisor and I just have very different style of working and I would say we ended on slightly bad terms. However, I feel that I did experienced and learnt some things (although by myself, but his lab provided the resources) that I feel is quite valuable. I'm just worried that in the future, the employer might contact him and I doubt he would put in good words for me.

TLDR: Do employer really contact the people that we put on CV."
64631,"Re #64562 , the OP was the group leader for our project. First, let me describe the outcome. Out of 4 members in the group, we scored 3A- and 1A. Project contributed to 40% of the grade. So overall the project was well done, as seen from the results.

Next, many of you may ask, how effective are your methods in group work? To put this into perspective, 3 of us are either taking double major or double degree, including the OP of the other article. In other words, time is very tight. OP of that article may exaggerate a bit in her words, but we are all very punctual, and it was only once someone was late due to her carelessness, so everyone downed 20 as half a joke and also a reminder to be responsible to the group.

It was natural that OP was the group leader of our group as she has a very clear sense of direction, and there are no objections to that. There’s only one problem - OP brags too much about her bf during out discussions. She sometimes exaggerate too much, just like the character of our group overall."
64629,"For guys having a hard time getting a girlfriend or date through dating apps, you can use other apps to find foreign girls too. I got together with a Japanese Girlfriend on a language app. Girls overseas are prettier, more willing to reply and meet, have lesser princess syndrome and less materialistic. 

You see other countries the guys can look average but have pretty girlfriends while here the average looking girls here have handsome boyfriends. So guys, have more confidence because you are worth so much more. 

Singaporean girls might not want you (because their expectations are unrealistic and limitless) but foreign girls would want you (because to them we make good husbands and boyfriends)"
64628,I have been going on dates with a guy and he has confessed that he wants to bring our relationship to the next level. But I'm not sure to trust him or not when he says he likes me. He is following a lot of pretty girls (those with many followers or are mini influencers) on instagram. He compliments them about their good looks in the comments section and sometimes through dm for insta stories. Does he really like me or is he just flirting around?
64626,I found out recently that my current girlfriend's ex was an NSF when we first met during orientation (she was still attached then). I myself was dumped by my ex during NS and I swore to never date a girl who did such a thing or to perpetuate this cycle. I feel extremely disturbed by this revelation. I have half a mind to end the relationship now with my current girlfriend...I can't believe I did this to some poor dude in NS now...feels really bad man...
64624,Sometimes when my boyfriend sees a pretty girl or a photo of a hot girl he makes a slurping noise. Am I crazy to get angry
64618,"Hi, am an incoming freshie this year. Got accepted into civil engineering but was wondering if it is possible to take common engineering for my 1st year instead? I would like to explore the different engineering courses before deciding on which one to major in"
64617,Are guests for commencement assigned seats or is it free seating? My parents are divorced and it will be awkward if they have to sit together...
64614,"For those males who are mocking people for failing on dating apps, you really need to try how freaking hard the online dating game is for males yourself. It is just so hard to get matches since the gender ratio and activeness is so skewed that I realized getting 1 match per week is already considered a lot. I chatted with my friends that also using dating apps and realize not getting any match in months is totally normal. And those guys are not even unattractive type with some of them eventually able to get girl friend in real life. 

Even after getting matches, many of them are not even responsive to your messages and you really have to be really good or lucky to get them out in real life. So far I was only able to get 2 of them out out of the 20-30 matches (excluding clearly catfish profiles). I think most girls on those app are deeply suspicious of those apps too. One of the girl that I asked out tell me she thought I am some kind of player of be on those app.

Really unless you are so desperate that you are willing to accept girls a few league below you, dating apps probably will not work for you at least if you are like me who is not willing to spend any money to unlock helping features. But then again even if you are desperate enough unless you are considerably attractive already, you will not even be get any girls out in real life to begin with."
64613,"Actually have two things to write here, 2) is for experts and Prof Ben.

1) I once talked to the FASS canteen noodle stall owner, why they wanna price at like $2.30, instead of $2.50 which will make changing money a lot more convenient for them (iirc to change for loose change at the bank will incur a processing fee), also we don't have to carry 20cents.

They told me the school sets the prices and they are not allowed to change without approval

If we can pay another 20 cents to make it a round number, I wouldn't mind because not only 20 cents don't really make us richer or poorer but it really helps the auntie and uncle because  it's more convenient and gives them more margin. Considering most of the food in the canteen is already $3,4+ I think this slight price increase is fair.

2) Intended for CS Profs and the great Prof Ben. Would you recommend top CS students to join Chinese tech companies like the BAT and Huawei instead of FAANG? What are your views of Chinese tech firms compared to American ones? For non-CS students wise, is it also advisable to work for a Chinese company, if any subject matter related expert knows?"
64611,"What's the point of getting a degree if the offers I get are diploma-ish pay. Not trying to bring down diploma holders but there's a reason (probably the sole reason for the bulk of us) degree holders go through four years of uni. Maybe I should blame myself for not getting FCH...

Sorry for the annoying rant, just want to vent my frustration on social media."
64610,"i have been at the edge of my seat for so long wanting to say this, but some people really just lack sincerity in the way they do things. Saying things merely due to convenience and pretending they really care about you."
64609,"Hi all,

Do y'all think it's okay for a student to date a professor, vice versa?"
64603,"It is difficult for the majority of guys using dating apps to find a girlfriend. In the past 1 year, I have gone on average 2-3 dates a month in hope to find a suitable partner and probably after seeing some 30 girls or so (you lose count after a while) and much effort, I finally met the girl I want to be with. 

Through the dating apps (Tinder and CMB), I end up going out with 1 in 10-15 of my matches. There is always a higher likelihood for replies on CMB as compared to Tinder. I probably matched with some 300-500 girls in the entire year and I initiate conversations about 30-40% of the time. What I found helps with my matches is, deleting your account once in a while and restarting all over, it gives you the mini boost at the start. Nice photos are important and I did pay for their premium services once or twice, it does help but often I find it not worth it. As a guy you’re either the cute or hot kind, find your niche, ask your female friends. Nice is a bad sign.

The dates. Most girls won’t go to the next date for whatever reason they might have. Persistence dosen’t work much because at any point they are talking to 2-3 guys at a time.  I was getting a lot of rejections at the start and the middle and I struggled to figure out why. It was only after I started gymming and bulking up did the matches want to continue going out with me. Looks matter a lot. I also realized that driving makes a huge difference. Girls who I drove home, actually all of them, would agree to go on the next date. All would start to reciprocate my interest after they see the car. Sad but true.
Above all, be genuine. The right one will appreciate it. Success is the right time and opportunity.

Avoid girls who just broke up and wanting to know more people. Waste time only.

I did reject some towards the end after finding what works for me. Use whatever advantage and experience you have, you’ll need it.

Ultimately, don’t give up. It is very very very difficult out there for the non top 5% of guys. You will feel like shit, hate yourself, but at the end, worth it. 

For those not getting matches, try elsewhere. My gf was 1 in the 300-500 of my matches. 1 in the 30+ dates. And i admit, I am picky so it took longer.

Good luck!"

What motivates you to live another day?"
64601,"Replying to #64584: Chinese girl with an Indian boyfriend here. Don't be discouraged by these girls you've spoken to. There are plenty of people who are open to dating outside of their race, even for reasons beyond your control (eg. I find their facial features very attractive). Just be sincere, friendly, and make interesting conversation. 

Conversational topics that turns one off: poor grammar and spelling, complaining about your job incessantly, making racist jokes, and starting with superficial comments like :'hey pretty girl', love bombing (We've just matched but let's get married), or straight-up giving an MCQ (A: Drinks, B: Dinner and movie, C: Netflix and chill). 

Many of the guys I've spoken to said all the weird things above (90% were Chinese for some reason). The first person I went on a date with was my bf and I never looked back. Best decision I have ever made. Point is, there is someone out there for you.

Maybe using dating apps like CMB, which clearly indicates your race, so you'll get matches from girls who are still interested?"
