64299,"Do you guys think it's about the time for the school to get rid of the Grab scooters? I rarely see people using them nowadays because of the many rules put in place to ensure safety. Don't get me wrong, I do support these safety measures. But as result it's not worth the effort to use these scooters anymore.

Additionally, there are a few times during rainy/windy days when I see multiple grab scooters near the bus stops topple over, making it a tripping (and safety) hazard, not to mention blocking the footpath in the process. Really an accident waiting to happen."
64292,"I have a gf who is interning at a company where her dad is a shareholder. She has been interning for abit over a month and the stress she experienced there has affected our rs. Ive advise her to take things ez and asked her out on dates to relieve her stress. Although she tries to free out her time, she always lacks in enthusiasm and claimed that some of the other interns have started gossiping about her. Hence she is determined to prove her ability to others despite not coming from a local uni and relying on connections. Supposed to relax during our short overseas trip last weekend but bcos an intern in her group hasnt completed his part, we stayed in the hotel for almost the whole trip so that they could submit the proposal b4 the deadline. Heh thanks to that person, there goes our weekend. She has gotten sick yesterday so i cancelled the yesterday's datenight and forced her to rest instead. She also became rather quick tempered and small quarrels will occur frequently when our opinions differ. Is she gonna be a workaholic soon?? Im really afraid that she will turn into one. What should i do if she does? Helps!!"
64290,"Been looking for a job since late Feb. By now probably 70-80% of them have secured a job. Frankly, I have received offers but have rejected them because the pay is either too low (low 2Ks) or not useful for career progression. My older friends (people in their 40s and 50s) keep telling me to just get into a SME and just work whatever job there is regardless of the pay or experience because you will learn alot. 

However, I feel that it is a very old-fashioned mindset that may not work well in today's era because competition is so fierce now and being in a SME won't get you far in the global stage, especially against foreign talent. Or is this just my millennial mindset?"

64268,"Hey #64268, let me share how I returned a similar favour in a mix of entertainment value and monetary value. 

A friend once transferred a month of fitness class subscription to me which I have wanted to try but unable to afford then. I have intention to return this big favour to him too. I know he would not accept actual price payment* or some friendship price so I decided to do it in a jokingly way. I took photos of me in stupid funny pose during each workout such as flexing my mini muscle, showing my butt, showing my fat tummy. At the end of the month, I thanked him for letting me try out those fitness routines and offered to buy him a lunch for that while sending those photos inbetween the conversation haha. Seeing those photos made him cursed me out, but in a friendly manner and we both had a good laugh over it. The lunch treat happened and concluded with the food choice to his liking, pricing to my comfort and us TCSS over the lunch. We both considered the favour has been returned in our heart.

You pointed out receiving 70/100 dollars meal plan as a big favour, maybe you are having financial difficulties just like me then and there is a possibility that your friend might see the 70/100 dollars lunch treat as a burden to your financial situation instead, thus refused it. Don't worry about that and don't think so much since you have now decided to go ahead with the drink treats to return the favour. Spend your brain cells on the drink sessions and do your best making her feel happy during each session. To me, a 70/100 cents cup of kopi with friends and smiles along the way tastes much better than an expensive cup of kopi without a moment of joy. Perhaps you can also rate the top 3 of the 14 meals you received and bring her to eat there. I believe the individual meal pricing should be within the comfort level of your and her for a lunch treat.

May you have a long lasting friendship with her! Happy weekend! 

* If this is the payback option, I have no money to pay up too. haha

P.S. Both are males in my story, but not a gay story with the photo part ya!"
64267,"Re: #64170 expected starting salary for non-IT business roles, e.g. sales and marketing, business analysts, HR for FAANG offices based in Singapore?

FANGMAN companies typically operate on a SaaS subscription model nowadays. Non-IT business roles could fall under 3 broad categories: (1) Sales & Marketing, (2) Finance, Operations and/or Strategy, (3) Customer Success.

Under Sales, there are entry-level roles like Sales or Business Development Representative which pays low base, and your role is to help solicit business for your Account Executive, which you would eventually be promoted to after a couple years with base+commission. Usually hire salespeople with Southeast Asia language.

Under Marketing, depending on your expertise ranging content marketing, digital marketing, field marketing, product marketing and etc.

Under Finance/Ops/Strategy, these roles are usually pay above average depending on the company. They usually hire early experienced management consultants or investment bankers. Roles include sales/marketing ops, business ops analysts, data scientists. Also an exit option for those who can’t take the harsh hours.

Under Customer Success, your role is to ensure successful onboarding/implementation starting as a CS Associate to CSManager.

I would say that FANG-type foreign companies (experiencing hypergrowth) would provide a minimum salary of $3,000 (or lesser for sales). Currently, there is an influx of such SaaS companies such as Salesforce.com, Spotify, Cloudfare, LinkedIn and etc which I feel the public is not very aware of and I hope to share this with everyone. Nonetheless, non-tech roles are getting very techy as the product you are selling is tech, so embrace it.

64265,"Hi guys, need some serious advice over here. Graduated in 2016 with a 2nd lower from NUS BBA and have been a contractor in a local bank for almost 3 years now. Due to my department's recent management change and the bad economy, I was let go recently (contract not extended). I have been trying to look for other banking jobs but it has not been very successful. Recently, the thought of taking an MBA crossed my mind and I found out that the average NUS MBA graduate earns $90,839 per year (base) - which is about $7.5k a month: https://mba.nus.edu.sg/en-SG/career/job-salary-statistics/#. 
The employment statistic of NUS MBA grads also seems decent at 96%.... Do you guys think it would be a good idea for me to apply and go for it? Does an average NUS MBA graduate really earn S$7.5k a month? Is it easy to get into the programme? Would very much appreciate any help that I can get!"

Every semester till year 4 we are pre-allocated 4 core mods (worth 16MCs), and there is a high chance the timetable for these 4 pre-allocated mods will clash with the CT mods. This happened to us in semester 2, so we couldn’t take it. In semester 1 we were pre-allocated GER1000 on top of our 4 core mods, and we could not overload then since it would exceed the limit set for freshmen.

Unlike our friends from other courses, we don’t have the  flexibility to change our pre-allocated core mods to fit in the CT mod.

So my issue is, in the 4 semesters left from now (year 2) to year 3, will there be any sems when the CT mods don’t clash with our core mod? If yes, how many? It’s hard to plan given such inflexibility and so many unknowns."

64215,"There was a poster enquiring about non technical salaries for FAANG companies in Singapore.

As someone who has first hand experience with a number of these companies, let me share a few of my insights relating specifically to non technical roles of major tech companies in Singapore.

1.  US =/= Singapore 

The major tech companies that have setup shop in Singapore generally do not pay too well for non technical roles. I remembered being quite surprised at how average some of their offers were as compared to other big MNCs. 

2. They can be quite sexist.

Major plus points if you’re an Asian female. This is so as to score two points “gender” + “race” in the equation when hiring and promoting. I remembered a fresh batch from one company renowned in the enterprise space to have absolutely zero men in the non technical arena.. and let’s just say the female candidates were incredibly dense (but no you can’t say that publicly of course).

3. Foreign languages help...

Most of these companies are using Singapore as a regional hub so if you know bahasa or Thai, it helps.."

64210,"Hi I’m the OP of #64184 and I want to clarify some things. We went out as friends. Yes friends. It’s not a date. I don’t have to pay for a friend whom I just met. 

I actually wanted to ask her to pay me back before we went back but she was just talking non-stop and didn’t give me any chance to say anything. But ya I should have asked to pay back in person so she couldn’t ignore or block me. 
We agreed to meet at Somerset then find a place to eat. I was okay with the restaurant but was not okay with paying for her. Previously when I asked girls on tinder (going out as friends, I will pay for dates) to pay me back they would. This is the first time I have encountered such a person who refuse to pay back even after asking her and even blocking me, that’s what I’m most unhappy about. When messaging her, she felt like a good person so I thought it she would make a good friend. 

She told me that she has never had a boyfriend before and probably never will. Now I see why."
64204,"I finally found words to describe my past relationship, and I wonder if anyone relates to me?

I met a guy 3 years back, he was really very sweet with his words, I felt smitten. I thought he had potential and decided to dive into a relationship. It wasn’t smooth. He clubbed a lot while I don’t. Quarrels, fights and misunderstanding happened within the 1st month we got together. Things went very ugly one fine Saturday night, about 1 month into our relationship. He slept with another girl he met from the club.  He blamed it on me that I caused him to cheat (I admit I wasn’t a good gf), and he blamed the alcohol. I was extremely hurt about the blame, and I decided to call it quits.

He tried to salvage the relationship. He put in 100% effort trying to win me back. He changed 180 degrees, quit clubbing all together and he did his best to reassure me. And me, being emotionally weak, got back together with him, against all my friends advices, and without thinking properly. I wasn’t prepared to work things out with him again. 

Cheating may have scarred the victim and cause immense pain (I cried almost every other day after I got back together with him, and I felt so conflicted). What most people don’t know about cheating is that the cheating hurts the cheater the most. I became a monster. He was my punching bag. He gave me the permission to judge him, to abuse him emotionally and verbally, to manipulate him, to be always angry and bitter at him, to always suspect him for attempting to cheat again. All these just because he cheated. He was very guilty, and the perpetual look of grief in my eyes pained him all the time. 

Even after I initiated a break up yet again, he wanted to be there for me, and kept saying that there will be no other guy who would do as much as he did for me, and no one else will be able to tolerate me. It wasn’t a clean break up and we were both left dangling. Since the break up until early this year (about two years plus), I struggled with forgiveness, still felt bitter, and I kept thinking there will be no other guy who will treat me as good as my ex. I was going in a viscous cycle. Every time I met up with guys on the dating app and if I didn’t feel the same attraction as I did with my ex, I always felt like going back to my ex, as I thought there are no one else better than my ex. I would text him again and then get bitter at both myself and my ex. At one point of time, I gave up on the dating app, and I doubted I would find myself a partner as good as my ex.

It was only recently that I decided to start afresh. To make a conscious effort to not be reminded of my ex and his mistakes, and of all the regrets. Few months after my commitment, I met a wonderful guy on one of the dating apps. I didn’t have any expectations of him at all, due to my failed experience. But he is so damn sweet in action. While we have only just started hanging out as friends, he opens doors for me (even the car door). He surprises me with food at my house or at school. Whenever we go out to trek or to café hop, he will never fail to prepare a tumbler of water for me in his car, to keep me hydrated, as I tend to fall sick easily. He has even baked a cake for my birthday. I didn’t know that true gentleman existed! Do Singaporean guys still do this?

Tl;dr: 

If cheating was ever on any of you guys and girls’ mind, please don’t do it. It will hurt the person you love and it will hurt the cheater even more. And don’t settle. You deserve better. There is someone out there who will treat you the way you deserve. Happy Sunday folks! :)"
