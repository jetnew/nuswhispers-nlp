My mother is very happy that means I am going into finance and banking and her initital choice of forcing me to do mathematics so I can become a finance expert (SURELY SHE MEANT BUSINESS FINANCE??? OR MATHEMATICS AND FINANCE AT NTU??) 


but no they rather i become a teacher or a finance.

they always get hwat they want. sometimes I don't know why I bother living. 

I used to have friends to break away from my family influence, because once they have leverage on me, they just push it. now they want the dog, like family fighting over your children because they fall sick. lol



ANd I guess that's all the positive image Ihad the last year?
LOL all gone becuasemy family came. How CNA THAT BE TRUE? HOW CNA I BE A GOOD PERSON? THere's only one good son, he's working at hospital in aust. I am the slut of the house. LOL"
53695,#53695- your boss sounds like an arrogant moron who’s making you insecure with his ignorant claptrap. It’s because he or she doesn’t have any skin in the game and is avoiding to spend the money to train you for more well paid roles. So find another boss in the same company or find another job.
53693,"Does anyone know how I can go about joining a CCA even after Student Life Fair? I didn't go for any welcome tea apart from some community service CCA that's only relevant every once a month, so I kinda regret my decision.

I'm interested in trying a sports CCA now but I dont know if they still accept late newcomers. Do I really have to wait for next year just to join a new CCA again?"

53688,"I see most people here complaining about their life and whatever is happening. 

Guys, be thankful to what you have in your life. Not everyone has that. I am single, came from another country to develop myself among the best community in Asia.

Having no 'real' friends here yet, I try to enjoy their company to the most. Trust me, they are not even friends according to my definition (every person always got some work, and I am always the one who manages the work to come for their proposed meet). I cannot blame them or tell them that they aren't my good friends, the fact is they are really bad at managing their time. Maybe I am habituated with what I had earlier, my friends from my homeland made me so much dependent on these connections that I still miss them.

I see these beautiful girls here, I feel like having an emotional relationship, and sharing my bed and thoughts with a girl. But as I do not have that (couldn't find THE ONE here, or maybe they didn't me), I try to engage myself traveling to new places most times or trying new things. Obviously, you cannot get everything, I can see that girls aren't interested in me (it's the beard - I have a great European beard which I am not shaving for a girl here). I would love to know some hiking spots here in Singapore.

I love NUS, it has provided me with the best resources in the country: talk about U-Town! You can possibly get the best lifestyle possible here. Gym, Sports, Food, Cafes, Greenery, best residences, everything under some hundred meters. 

Obviously, everyone has negative experiences, even I do -- nobody's living without problems -- it's a sinusoidal wave. But why tell those to people here on a social group who don't even know you and your emotional situation or condition. Instead, talk to your close ones regarding the same. These social groups aren't going to help you. Fking be thankful for what you have! Be happy and be high on euphoria dude. It's that time to develop into something better. This definitely ain't coming back.

PS: NUSWhispers should add another category for such posts. Euphoria will make a good name for the same."
53687,Generally asking - how is the casual dating scenario amongst NUS students? Are boys/girls even interested in such encounters or they look for a long-term relationship here?
53686,"How often do NUS students go out for clubbing? Is it very common among students or they prefer cafes/library more?
I love clubbing (specifically live music and drinks) but haven't found anybody interested in spending time like that.
Does NUS have any regular live music sessions somewhere? Or jamming sessions where people come along and perform?"
53685,"Reading #53672 on a cool rainswept evening brought back bittersweet memories from a distant past. Many years ago, I too was young and, like many of the youths here, filled with these dilemmas of ""does she like me back"", ""should I ask her"", ""will we work out"", etc. I met this girl at college and we clicked so well and had such similar interests and outlook in life, that our friends always teased us and thought that we were a couple or about to be a couple. We went for meals and movies together, hung out, texted etc but ... I never asked her the question as I was unsure if she liked me back in that way. In a way, I also didn't feel sexually attracted to her and saw her (back then) as more of a sister, although I knew even then that rationally we would have made a great couple as we shared so many similarities in terms of perspectives, temperament, religion, family background etc. 

Life took its course: college ended, we went separate ways at university, and we began to drift apart, though we still kept in touch, visited each other at our halls, and met up during the vacations. We both graduated and got professional jobs. We stayed in touch and met up for dinners on weekends, and even then I hesitated to ask as I was unsure whether she saw me as more than a friend. I also wondered if she would settle for me (despite our similarities, her family situation is slightly better off) and I told myself that I doubted my readiness to commit. Obviously she never asked either.

Seasons passed and one day she told me that she was getting married. Well, I wasn't really surprised of course as she was eligible, and there was no reason to suppose she wouldn't move on in life at some point. I wished her well, although I did not think I wanted to attend the wedding and so I made up an excuse. We did schedule one last meet-up before that, in the presence of her fiance. I was very glad to see at least that he seems a fine young man who will give her the sort of life and happiness that I, a struggling graduate student, would probably not be able to provide. Unlike you, I never got to ask her the question whether she ever felt for me and whether we ever could have worked out if I had asked back then, when we were close. I felt it would have been awkward, and pretty selfish, to ask for the sake of my own closure when she was already engaged, so I simply wished the happy couple well, and I never contacted her again ever since. Also, unlike you, I never found another, and so today the loves of my life are only my immediate family, my work (which I do love a lot), my former students, and the campus cats.

The purpose of writing this is to tell those of you out there, especially the guys, not to overthink and not to hesitate too much in the prime of life. It is easy to make up excuses for not asking and for not taking the friendship a step further, but remember that inaction has consequences too, many of them irreversible. If you want a partner/spouse, you have to go for it, you have to risk some things. Looking at many of the earlier posts expressing doubts and uncertainty on this page I just want to say, from the perspective of one who's been through that phase and unfortunately missed the boat, that:

Young ones shouldn't be afraid 
To live, love 
While the flame is strong 
'Cos we may not be the young ones
Very long"
53684,"There's this common saying in CS or perhaps any other major ""Grades are not everything"", which means ""grades are not that important"" , often said by the people who got good grades. It still doesn't answer the question of ""Are grades important?"" Maybe that is true when you're comparing 2 good scores(4.5 and 4.8), which is somehow like an upper bound for the score you can get. 

However, considering the lower bound now, you happen to be one with a CAP of 3.0(or even struggle to graduate) and you're not good with anything else employers want from you. In that position, would anyone still bother to learn ""extra"" stuff out of their course curriculum that help ""boost their portfolio""? I think not."
53682,"I got rant this off my chest because it sounds pretty ridiculous but is a true story. As much as I like my mother, I really her way of feeding the family to the point she is over feeding and causing my family members to be fat. 

My mum really loves eating and eats a lot in one setting since she does alot of housework, which I find it reasonable. But because of this, she feeds the entire family with her amount and pampers my brother and sister with so many extra food in a meal. 
For instance of a meal, she would get each of us a packet of rice (with extra rice) with 2 meats and 1 tofu, then she will get a bowl of soup and very often will add in more meat or fish separately to share. She also tends to store the fridge with tons of desserts and drinks in case we get hungry and can eat at any point of the day. As a result, both my brother and sister are now severely overweight, my sister can be considered obese now. 

I confronted my mother on many occasions to tell her about this issue, told her that's not how you should feed your children and stop assuming they are still growing when they are already on their early twenties, but she would always be so annoyed and refuted my father and my argument saying its nonsense. Because of that, as much as possible, I begin to shun away to eat with my family and would dabao my own meals since we cannot agree. However, I felt this is causing communication problems and also more importantly, my mum's ignorance is slowly bring my family member's health to danger. 

What should I do?"
53678,"I abhor ppl that harp on degree not important lah, just randomly start on own biz without degree, then you can own all these college grads. 

Erm pls. if it is so easy to start a random biz then you yourself will not be in college. But your continued enrollment in college suggest that u recognise college importance. In fact a lot of skills and environmental factors needed to create a start up are found in college education.

Almost all billionaires are college grads or at least college dropouts who experienced the college milleu before dropping out. But college millieu is really important.

53677,"Hi I might have recalled wrongly but I think NUS is supposed to be a smoke-free campus. Did any policy change? There seem to be a smoking hotspot along the route from clb lvl 1 to biz canteen. Cigarette butts and even full smoking cigarettes can be found easily.

Assuming one smoker per day, and each fine is $500, 1 week of fines can probably cover camera installation costs, in the long run, it could be a new source of revenue for NUS."

53672,"#53672 Thank you for your post, it really reaffirmed my decision in asking my crush out, despite it not ending well. I would say I was in a very similar situation as you, and ended being ghosted and subtly rejected (which I couldn't tell if it was a rejection or that it was a legit reason for quite a long period of time). It was a devastating period of guessing game and constantly picking myself up to try again and ask again. Nevertheless, my crush got attached to someone else after a few semesters of guessing game. While I was sad, it was a relief that the torturous guessing games can finally cease.

Therefore, I would like to add a clause that asking should not come with an expectation of a reply. It might be a bold step to ask - and I do still fervently believe in that, regardless of what I have been through - but that doesn't guarantee you a direct reply and you shouldn't use that to encourage you to be bold and ask. In other words, don't be encouraged by the fact that you can open Schrodinger's box once you ask. Only ask when you are sure you want to start a relationship with this person, and put all thoughts of whether this will lead to awkwardness and whatnot aside. A mature question begets a mature response, and if the other party fails to rise up to the occasion, perhaps you wouldn't need an immature friend like this anyway.

I would also like to encourage you that you should not regret not asking her out at all. Because not being with her is the reason you are now happily attached to your girlfriend. Think of it this way, the opportunity is not something you want to have anyway. If you had gotten into a relationship with her, you could have not gotten along and broken up with her by now. If you regret, are you thinking along the lines of ""the relationship could have been better if I were with her instead?"". Drop that unhealthy thought!"
53671,"Friends. What are friends? Sometimes I wished I was the ignorant one.

Thanks all for the whispers-consensus that we are likely to be just aquaintances than friends. (have to be careful with definitions and confirmation bias)
I'm definitely hoping to look for genuine friends within the same major. However for now, I've decided to settle with this bunch of aquaintances while having friends outside school. Giving them the BOD, and hope the situation might get better. (This might just be an excuse to maintain the status quo. Who knows if I don't know myself?)

But to give you a gist of the situation now: I am shoving out all my thoughts about seeking a friendship where I can say ""I'm bored..how ah?"" with this bunch and just drown myself in studies.

P.S. I hope others don't end up like me.
Friends. What are friends?

53670,"""Crush or crushed""
You first saw her in school,
your heart raced whenever she enters your field of vision,
you can't control your eyes that constantly moved in her direction,
but you know it's unrequited love,
even then part of you pictured a scene or a timeline in which you were together,
after all that,
you decided you will move on,
yet as you walk along the streets,
as you take the mrt,
as you sat in the library,
you constantly search for signs of her,
looking at the backs of people,
hoping it was her,
even though you know,
she's not going to be yours."

#53562, #53581, #53597: There are multiple reasons it could be broken actually, but usually generic parts are available. However, what we're talking about here is not a simple swap. I've never asked the staff at co-op before but I doubt they have the equipment and expertise to do it. (Not saying that they're bad!)

Unfortunately, and this may seem like raising your hopes to dash it again, I don't know of any local third-party repair shops. Maybe someone reading this can suggest?

I can do the repair, but it will probably take a week or more waiting for replacement parts. Again, other nerds can feel free to volunteer if you have the expertise/confidence!



One thing I left out in my original reply to you: The 600-800 you're paying at Apple for the repair goes into them giving you an entirely new logic board. A third-party repair will just replace the small tiny components on your old logic board that broke.

Let me break that down for you: In both cases, your original issue will be fixed, and has the same (hopefully low) chance of recurring again. However, for the third-party option, you still have the accumulated risk of other things breaking down with age, since you are still using your old logic board.

So it is up to you to decide whether spending the 600-800 on the official repair is worth:
1. A firmer repair schedule
2. Practically getting a partial refurbishment of your mac
3. Proper liability coverage in case the same issue happens again in 1 month

Take care!"

I usually sit through almost all of my lectures without even absorbing anything; basically wasting 2-3 hours of my day each time sitting there like an idiot. Yes, I can proudly say I go to school and come back home learning nothing.

This handicap has put me lagging tremendously far down compared to all my peers. Whenever tutorials come about, everyone would have done their work already while I'd have spent the night before still struggling to do topics from 2-3 weeks ago by myself and so in tutorials, I just sit there in class like a clueless idiot yet again. I'm like in an entirely different timezone.
And of course it's even worse when CP marks are involved which basically amounts to a test of whoever can think up of something to say the fastest.

This slow rate of thinking is so slow, I can't even grasp simple conversations with friends at times or instructions for say, an orientation game. It really makes me look like a fool to everyone most of the time when I'm actually not.

Sometimes, I don't even know how I made it to NUS to begin with. I guess my only redeeming factor is that with enough time I can grasp the knowledge, and that's only how I managed to always score well in exams.

To the extent of his exes calling him up at night just to share their work/school related or relationship issues and he of course, entertains them (when I don't even call him up for that tbh...) 

Should I be worried? I do trust him; it's just that I don't really trust... them. 
Because personally, if I'm that ex I wouldn't even be contacting him when I found out he already has a girlfriend - to avoid any misunderstandings and respect their space. I mean, common consensus, if you wanna have someone listen to your issues, you would approach your close friends rather than an ex, right? "

So guy B and I have been talking Everyday but our conversations are mainly about him. But I don’t know why there is a shift of  attitude from guy A. He used to be Super nice and help
Me willingly but these days he goes, why not you ask guy b to help you? Anyway, he keeps encouraging me to find guy B. So one day, we had a talk and guy A said he didn’t expect me and guy B to be friends because our personalities clashes. He also mentioned that guy B really cares about me and he is rich. If I ever show a bit of concern to guy B, guy A would be irritated. I want to remain close to guy A, what should I do?"
