62195,"Many of the posts I see here, and on social media, are highly speculative. I really hope that we can all hear what NUS has to say on their part first -- a crucial piece of the picture which NUS has not had the chance to provide (until the townhall session). 

Let's not be anxious that giving them a chance to explain their side of things will amount to inaction on their part. I doubt that this will slide, given the PR crisis that this has caused. But rather, we need to listen and understand what went down with respect to the NUS BOD's decision. It's only right that we determine what went wrong (relatedly, how much of it was within NUS' control?) and temper our charges towards NUS accordingly. 

So I really do hope that as we attend the session (or stay updated through secondary sources), we can do so with an open mind and willingness to listen. Listen -- with charity, yet not without close scrutiny. We want NUS to hear our voices, but we need to first listen well in order to put forth the best voices. "
62194,"FOREVER SINGLE. GIVE UP ON LOVE.

It’s pretty funny when I see the profile of some of the people who commented on posts with themes of being ‘forever single’ & ‘being a looser’.

You click into their profile and they look exactly the way you would imagine him to- a socially awkward Otaku that posts about how lonely he is.

Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against Otakus or being socially awkward. But post after post about being lonely, giving up on finding a partner, being called a creep by other girls.etc. It almost feel like these people are so comfortable in their self-pity that it’s all the reality they know.

I know life isn’t fair. Some of us are born better looking, or healthier, or richer or whatever & if you are going to argue based on natural selection- the fittest, the best genes procreate & survive then yes y’all have all the reason in the world to wallow yourself in your self pity.

 But at the end of the day, this is not a hunting ground and we are not barbarians. We are all civilised being in a civilised society trying to find meaning, Joy & trying to live life.

So to those of y’all out there that constantly complain about being lonely & ugly & whatever, I have tips for y’all:

1)Think about who you are trying to attract & then consider who those people are attracted to? Who do you think are attracted to you? How can you become someone they are attracted to? [Then start working on them. Be the man of your dreams.]

2)Shut up. All your whining doesn’t really do too much for you- it’s also terrible branding. Because now you are known as the weird guy who goes around telling people how pitiful he is.

3)Work on yourself. Like if you spent 1 hour per day in the gym instead of wallowing in self pity. You would have at least look better and feel better by the time you are done working out. 

4)Don’t look like a such a ‘looser’. Spent money, buy clothes that makes you feel good and look good. Don’t know how? Pinterest, Google,YouTube. Tons of resources at your disposal- the question is do you want to work on yourself?

5)Learn. Just as you would do so if you were weak in a subject. Go learn how to interact with people, learn charisma, learn how to be an interesting individual that draws life to himself. Watch charisma on command, read 12 rules of life by Jordan Peterson. Ask people you look up to how they did it. There are plenty of resources!

I know it’s hard being you. But working on it rather than complaining about it is almost always better. It’s never too late to be the better version of yourself. So stop being such a whiny bitch and go do something about it. Your life is yours to live. Jiayou."
62178,"#61849 OP here: For those interested in my double life in a sugar relationship:
- No, in fact, he encourages me to date other men, especially men my age. Exclusivity is not a term between us. However, I have never being in a proper BGR, my experiences has always been with SDs and lovers. Should I have a BF, I would want to be faithful to him. 
- Arrangements either goes by monthly allowances or Pay Per Meet. Personally, I only accept monthly payments. He provides for my living expenses and tuition fees. Though I have a proper part time job drawing $1k monthly while studying, it's insufficient. 
- Not always. I know a particular dude who was once a high end male escort and had women taking care, grooming him to be a successful (wealthy) individual. Now, he's 'paying forward' to help girls out ???? But I have to say such cases are rare especially for a male. He's charming and intellectual to begin with, he just get resources in such a quicker method. 
Am lucky to meet my current SD and we've been together for 1.5years. Neither the wealthiest nor most good looking, but well off and decent looking. Respectful and caring so far. We do activities together: swimming, reading books, having McD at 3am. I have met public figures before and most are petty douchebags! 

Also, thanks NUSWhispers for this platform to comment on such topics given that none of my family and friends know about this. :) "
62171,"Regardless of where you stand on the recent sexual harassment issue, I hope that people won't resort to saying things like well think about what this punishment will do to the perpetrator, 'what if he kills himself?' etc. Mental illnesses are a serious issue and I'm tired and disheartened to see that people just use it as a card to get away with things. I'm not saying I want him to kill himself or anything here. I'm saying that this is a horrible way to explain giving him a light sentencing. If you use this as a reason to explain giving people a light sentence, then it can apply to every case, right? So should we just ignore someone's wrongdoing and not address it because doing so will just cause them to kill themselves? Even more disheartening to see an actual proff taking this stance to justify the uni's actions.

Honestly, the issue here is about responsibility. We're all adults and we live in the 21st century. If I did something bad to someone else, I have to accept that even if I'm truly sorry about what I did to them, they are not obligated to accept my apology. If they decide to name and shame me on their social media/to their social circles, then, of course, it would put me in a bad situation, but it would be something that I can't get angry with them about because I was clearly in the wrong. Plus, think about why she named him in the first place. This was before the incident went viral on social media. All the school did was ask him to write a letter of apology, and suspend him for a semester (during which he actually got work experience). In the bigger picture, the punishment was nothing compared to the mental trauma inflicted on the victim.

tl;dr: mental illnesses are not a way to justify light sentences and you are not allowed to be annoyed that your victim didn't react the way you wanted."
62170,"I had a strange experience with a hiring process with a well known tech company, which I will not name, the recruiter told whether they want to hire me, I am required to seat through 6 rounds of interviews with various heads of the deparments, before they consider my suitability for the role. To make you understand this, the 6 rounds are already scheduled ahead for the candidate without considering his suitability for this role.

This made me really question the decision behind this hiring process, why cant they just gateway shortlist candidates instead of forcing candidates to seat through 6 rounds of interviews and then decide on a round table meeting? Dont they feel its really a waste of the candidates time traveling over to their office for an interview?"
62168,"I saw him again today, and I was reminded of what you did while we were together. I don't think I was an unreasonable boyfriend to you, and I believed that you were trying to be the best girlfriend you could to me.

But you cheated on me with him, and I only found out after your friends let me know that he always went home with you and that you guys would disappear for hours on end in school. I wasn't in the same school, and I just trusted that you wouldn't do anything funny in school, or that you wouldn't do anything while home alone. I can't get over what he did with you, and I can't stop imagining how it played out.

Did he approach you first or were you the one who approached him? After all, the receipt for condoms was with you.

I just can't get over what he did to you, even though it's been years and years since. I guess I'll never know."

62149,"Seeing so many news on men attempting sexual assault/stalking girls, makes me wonder if deep down, all men have some kinda sexual fantasy for girls whom they are attracted to, be it just some random girl on the street even if it isnt their partner(Wife/gf),even if they are in a committed relationship. Just that those on the news are men who have weak self control while most other men have better self control such that they don’t act on these thoughts?"
62147,"I'm applying for an internship in US, and the recruiter asks me for GPA in 4.0 scale. I informed that NUS uses 5.0 scale, and they asked me to convert to 4.0 scale so that they can have a rough evaluation. How should I convert NUS CAP to 4.0 scale? Thanks in advance."
62146,"Regarding the recent peeping tom incident. Here's an interesting observation: most netizens agree that the sentence should be harsher, but few dare state how much harsher they think it should be.

This is pretty important (think about it).

Suppose the fair sentence is marginally greater than the actual sentence, for example 24 months warning/probation versus the actual 12 months. Then it is quite possible that current social justice efforts are overdone.

Clearly there is an upper bound for harsh sentencing. I don't think it is fair to impose the death sentence or lifetime imprisonment for the culprit, for example.

Finally, it is only mature and morally correct to state one's ""price"" in a negotiation. This only needs to be done based one's best ability (e.g. a range/interval might be sufficient). In this case, an upper bound for the culprits sentence.

Otherwise you'd most likely end up in a trap (despite good intentions), where you are either: never satisfied, or just another cry baby seeking maximum revenge. "
62145,"In the first circular on the sexual harassment saga, there is this line ""The offences and penalties are made available online to all students to view at the end of each semester. You may view this on the NUS Student Portal.""

Can anyone shed some light on where can I find this information? I can't seem to find it anywhere in myEduRec. I need it for research purposes."
62143,"I'm a woman and I feel sorry for the Nicholas guy in the Monica Baey saga. Don't get me wrong - I'm not affiliated with Nicholas in anyway, nor do I think what Monica did was wrong or attention seeking or all those things the (horrible) (male) commenters are saying (everytime I read these kind of comments I feel sick). I just think that the perpetrator's current fate - having his face plastered all over the Internet with his army details and IC details and job details, even his (innocent?) girlfriend's face open for everyone to see - is a fate much much worse than if he had suspended longer, expelled, or even sentenced to jail for the what the 1 week that offenders usually seem to get. The system might be too lax for offenders, and that is something that the new Penal Code is already changing and NUS should also work towards, but his current situation is more akin to a public stoning. What more of his girlfriend, his family and his friends' who didn't do anything and now can no longer show their faces in public. The purpose of a jail term, or other sanctions, is to appropriately punish the offender, but then also to rehabilitate him and for him to change and move on with his life. If he doesn't change, then the system (is supposed to) punish him again. 

I blame NUS and the police force for this. If they had just handled the situation properly in the first place, it would not be such a fiasco as it stands now. If a 1 term suspension and a warning is the standard precedent for such first time offenders, they should have at least communicated this to Monica and the school, or have the guidelines and disciplinary committee procedure online for everyone to read. Taking Monica's word for it, they did not bother to involve the victim in the process at all or care about her welfare. And they should have provided avenues for Monica and other members of the community to feedback if anyone felt measures were not sufficiently taken, instead of forcing her to engage in this witch hunt just to get any answers at all. Nicholas committed an offence, a crime even - but ultimately his lame apology letter and one semester suspension was just what the school asked him to do, and the lack of police prosecution. He is being crucified not just for his crime, but for the problems of the entire system. 

The heart of the problem is NUS's - and perhaps Singapore's - culture of paternalism and arrogance. The authority always knows best, there is no transparency or opportunity for feedback or change, so much so that they don't bother about keeping the victim informed of what is happening - one email only?? How is that right - - or give the victim and the school community options to feedback for change. Its about keeping everything under wraps, saving face, and not telling anyone anything because students are stupid and don't know any better than school admin. And this is evidenced by their first statement about this matter ""we will convene a committee and get back to you next academic year""? There's not even an attempt to bother to address the public's concern. I'm willing to give NUS the benefit of the doubt that some investigation and disciplinary procedures are in place and were carried out, even if they may not be ideal. If they had just come out to share this, then the next issue is moving to improve these systems, rather than the state and flak they're receiving now. 

Serves NUS right that it all is blowing up in their face. Pity for Nicholas that he is nothing more than a scapegoat for the system's incompetence. "
62137,How to know if a guy is interested in you if he’s someone who is nice to all the girls and has the potential to become any girl’s crush? 
62134,"Despite not in Singapore, the news of Miss Monica appears in my newsfeed a lot.

I have been catching up with such news a lot from forums like HWZ, NUSWhispers, the Strait Times, responses, comments etc. Based on what I have read, a lot of responses seem to be revolving about demanding a harsher punishment because the punishment is not a good deterrent enough, which I do agree.

What I don't get it is few responses mention about improving the security in halls. I am an alumni from NUS, never stayed in NUS halls before so I don't know about the state of security in NUS halls. But from what I gather, firstly, the perpetrator himself is not even a resident from the hall. Secondly, the perpetrator went toilet to toilet to look for a victim, which gives me the impression he was not caught in act for some period of time (lets assume like 10 minutes). It seems like there is a security breach on the part of NUS halls.

While harsher punishments is a form of deterrent, shouldn't increasing of security in hall (more patrols etc) be an equal deterrent to be emphasized as well? "
62119,"Many people are talking about forgiveness and rehabilitation for Nicholas but fail to realize that these can only come after a commensurate punishment has been dealt to him. When the punishment given to him is not strict and people are jumping ahead and discussing the avenue for rehabilitation, something is clearly wrong. That’s not forgiveness, that’s foolishness. Think about if, what kind of message are you sending out to your students if your punishment for voyeurism is simply writing some letters, doing some CIP, taking some time off, and going for some counselling? The punishments given by the authorities is another (even thornier) matter that cannot be an excuse for the light sentencing given by NUS. While I think Nicholas shouldn’t be expelled over a moment’s folly, I do think harsher sentences like longer suspensions (at least 1-2 years) are needed from NUS.

I’m not a fan of taking justice into one’s own hands, but if you have been let down by both NUS and the police, then relying on social justice is just about your only option left, other than of course, do what you have been told and accept what is given. I’m all for rehabilitation of Nicholas too, but the fact of the matter is that Nicholas was not punished appropriately in the first place. His sentence was too light to offer any form of justice to Monica. And till that changes, Monica is more than justified in doing what she has done to rally for change on this matter from either the police or NUS. The forgiveness and sympathy talk can wait till after he has shown some semblance of public unforced remorse for his actions.

TLDR: people seem to be confusing calls for justice with calls for revenge. Given the way the situation has played out, the notion that Monica is out to harm Nicholas is simply unfounded and is perhaps the source of some way-too-early calls for forgiveness."
62114,"I am crafting this post amidst preparations for finals. The stress is boiling in me so please pardon my grammatical errors, if any. 

I don't usually take to posting on confessions seeking advice as I always felt it was difficult for people to relate and hence, understand my situation. Even, if they do, it's too long a story to fully grasp the gravity of what I went through. 

However, I am at wit's end and really don't know what to do from here onwards. 
I have tried to read the confessions posted here to see if there are any similar situations but none, unsurprisingly. 

My earliest memories of my parents were pleasant ones, being devoted, loving and committed to each other as well as to me. I started living with them only in my later teen years, and I found out the hard way as to why I was raised by my extended family. My father had been retrenched and refused to find employment (I was only in primary school then) and my mother was reluctant to support us and hence I was sent away to live with my grandparents while she recovered from depression. But ever since then, she deeply resented me and blamed me for all the bad things my father did. My father was irresponsible and leeched off not just from my mother, but his own mother as well. Constantly demanding money from a frail, old woman of 70plus years. As a child, seeing this supposed role model check off all the things a role model should NOT do, my moral compass was broken.

I was extremely suicidal by sixteen but that was the year of O Levels and I was determined to use education as a ticket to move out and get out because I flooded my mind with messages of motivational videos from people who came from broken homes. My school counselor told me to channel my energy into doing well, and that's what I did. Eventually scoring 10 points from an initial prelim score of 30+. 

I was neither the bright nor dumb but had a deep passion for subjects I was interested in. I knew education was my ticket out but I was feeling demotivated seeing their faces every single day. The feeling was eating me up alive, every day it felt like a constant reminder as to why I am a failure. 

Feeling trapped, I decided to find a sugar daddy because there was no way I could get out of my situation without the help of someone to pull me out of it. I was only eighteen. 

Fast forward to today, I found myself stuck in this situation again because I recently let go of my sugardaddy of two years. Despite having him helped me tremendously, I had to let him go because he abused other girls behind my back and I was in a beggars-cannot-be-choosers dilemma because staying with him meant having finances taken care of but at the expense of being together with a sexual predator. 

It was difficult but I couldn't stand it anymore. I didn't want to entertain the thought of him preying on his next eighteen year old. I didn't want to defend his actions anymore. 

The purpose of this post is to see if there are others out there like me, and if so what steps do you take to prevent yourself from falling back into depression/ suicide. Or how do you overcome a situation like this with or without the help of a sugardaddy. 

I am on the highest tier of financial aid (I explained to the school my situation), and am working on days I do not have school. Hostel is not an option for me because it is too expensive.

62111,"Regarding Ms Baey's case, why is everyone arguing about NUS being a disciplinary body or not? Hell ya it is! NUS has the power to discipline isn't it? Then where do you get all the suspension detention from? NUS cannot go into criminal record. We agree. But shouldn't NUS discipline students that did wrong? Especially in Nicholas Lim's case. Sexual harassment is not something funny. The damage is severe. The ATTITUDE of NUS is just bad at dealing it, hoping that people keep quiet about their pain. And still people are arguing if NUS should or should not discipline its students... 

Stay strong Ms Baey. I do support you on correct NUS's attitude on this. We cannot change the judge decision and there can be many reasons for his judgement, but we do believe that NUS needs to put in a proper attitude for sexual harassment. Whether you want fame or not (like what many other people are suspecting), is not the focus of this whole discussion. Even if your fame might come as a by-product, but what we want is NUS making a better change. 

I still love NUS, I still have faith in it, as for now. "

How far should a university’s disciplinary board go in a criminal matter?

I believe many people have read about a current female NUS student’s (let’s call her Ms M) recount of the horrible criminal act that was committed against her when a male student used his handphone to film her while she was showering. It is a horrible experience which, in the words of a very esteemed female professor whom I once heard say during a disciplinary board meeting over a similar peeping case – “It is a horrible experience which makes female students feel utterly unsafe on campus and the trauma is difficult to erase.”

So without a doubt, the act of being filmed in a shower is a very traumatising one and it is hoped that Ms M has received full support in helping her mitigate and hopefully overcome this mental trauma. Such criminal act has no place in a civilised society and no other NUS student, male or female, should be a victim of such acts.

That said, was Ms M justified in calling for NUS to mete out heavier punishment (which currently stands at a semester’s suspension and the perpetrator made to write an apology letter to Ms M) and basically expel the perpetrator? As someone who used to sit on the NUS Board of Discipline (“BOD”) as a NUSSU student rep (albeit back in 2013-2014 before the #metoo era), I think the matter is more nuanced.

1. Proper channel of recourse in criminal matter

If you look at what Ms M recounted, the matter was reported to the police, complete with CCTV evidence etc. Then, after investigations, the perpetrator was given a conditional 12-month warning period in lieu of prosecution. More damningly, Ms M said that the investigation officer told her to look for NUS if she wanted “heavier punishment”.

That’s when I think parties got things wrong.

In the criminal justice system, the Public Prosecutor (also concurrently the Attorney General) is the one, working with the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”), who decides whether to bring charges in a criminal matter, and if yes, what kind of charges to bring. It is not and should not be the province of NUS to bring criminal charges or mete out criminal punishment.

In this case, it is apparent that the good folks at the Attorney General’s Chambers (“AGC”) and SPF have decided not to press charges and instead issue a conditional warning period in lieu of prosecution. Legally speaking, that is and should be the end of the course of seeking criminal justice in this matter, simply because the person vested with prosecution powers (i.e. the Public Prosecutor) has made the decision not to press charges. The investigation officer should not have asked Ms M to ask NUS for “heavier punishment” because the criminal justice has run its course in this matter here. NUS does not have, and should not have, the powers to mete out criminal punishment or bring criminal charges.

2. Jurisdiction of NUS Board of Discipline

This was a question pondered by some of the BODs I sat on – what is the source of NUS’ disciplinary powers? My suggested answer, which didn’t get challenged, is that it arises from the contract signed between the student and NUS. The power to discipline has a contractual source but it may have a quasi-criminal nature due to the nature of disciplinary processes.

During the course of my time on NUS’ BODs, there are many cases where there is an act that has a criminal element. The standard NUS BOD practice, back in 2014, was to wait for the criminal proceedings to end before proceeding with the NUS disciplinary process. Although both proceedings arise from the same facts, they are of a different nature. The criminal proceeding arises from the public’s interest in ensuring that criminal conduct does not go unpunished. NUS’ disciplinary process arises from the university’s interest in ensuring that the rules and spirit of academia are kept in place and that students do not misbehave in the context of the university-student or student-student relationships/context.

To give an example, let’s say a student has been caught stealing outside. The criminal proceedings are for the act of stealing and how it harmed the public’s interest. The NUS disciplinary process is for how the act brought the university into disrepute. Fine but important difference – the NUS disciplinary process is and should never be a substitute for the criminal justice system. It is at best complementary but not a substitute.

3. Proportionality of sanctions

One controversial point raised by Ms M was that the sanctions meted out by the NUS BOD to the perpetrator (a semester’s suspension + write a private apology letter to Ms M the victim) is vastly disproportionate to the act itself. I make no comments on the proportionality of the sanction to the act, except that back in 2013-2014, the types of acts that attract expulsion from NUS usually involve academic dishonesty. Examples include repeated cheating, falsification of experiment results, fraudulent declarations during admission etc. It is not difficult to understand why – the university’s main interest is to maintain the integrity of the academia environment. Academic dishonesty strikes at the root of such integrity and therefore deserves the highest sanction – expulsion. Unfortunately, peeping and filming in showers/toilets did not fall within that category of acts that attract expulsion. Suspension and fine, yes, but not expulsion. At least not back in 2013-2014.

That being said, in the half-decade since, society has gotten more sensitised and enlightened over sexual assault, harassment and crime. I am sure the NUS administration will review the range of sanctions for different acts and update them to be in line with societal norms and expectations.

4. Pressure to keep things under wraps

I posted this earlier on Sheryl's post and I will repeat it here ad verbatim: “Can I just put it on record here that I once sat on a Board of Discipline regarding a peeping case in one of the Residential Colleges back in 2014. For context, the Board of Discipline is convened by the Registrar’s Office so it depends on the case being floated up or complaints made directly to the main university administration. What shocked the particular Board I was on was that the student being charged for peeping in showers was not a first time offender. Apparently the RC senior admin wanted to just give him an RC level disciplinary measure and keep it under wraps at the RC level. When the incident occurred the second time, they couldn’t contain it anymore.”

I think there is a bit of implicit pressure not to let things blow up at different levels of the NUS administration, from the university level (e.g. Registrar’s office) to the faculty or residential college/hall level. Perhaps something that should be considered is that clear and expeditious reporting of such acts should be mandatory and incentivised so that university administrators at all levels will feel no pressure to keep such acts under wraps. It will only be good for the university community at large.

5. Concluding thoughts

This is a horrible act by the perpetrator against a victim who was helpless (she was showering). He should not have done it even if it was allegedly under alcoholic influence (if you are drunk, go pass out on your own bed for the night). I feel for Ms M. After all, my wife, my sister and many other female friends stayed on campus and I shudder to think the trauma they would have felt in a similar situation.

Yet, I do not think NUS BOD is the best channel to address the seemingly disproportionately minor sanctions. The right course of redress is the criminal justice system. I am sure the good folks at AGC and SPF have their reasons, and I will leave it at that. Ms M may be better served by appealing through the usual political redress channels to have AGC and SPF revisit the case. Forcing NUS to serve criminal sanctions is a bad precedent that we should be hesitant to allow."
62102,"It's shocking how quickly commenters here turned against Monica Baey, accusing her of playing up the incident to seek attention. It's a reflection of how Singapore society treats sexual harassment in general - dismissive, and eager to point fingers at the victim. No wonder other victims of similar crimes are so afraid to speak up, they will be torn apart by unsympathetic netizens.

To date, the accused has not even issued a public apology of any sort. It is the least he can do in the face of such a huge uproar that is a direct result of his misdeeds. 

NUS needs harsher punishments to deal with individuals that engage in such morally apprehensive behaviour. The current punishment of a warning and one semester suspension amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist. At the very least, the perpetrator needs to be expelled. The school does not have the obligation to rehabilitate criminals, but it is obliged to protect its students. 

There is nothing wrong with the accused's reputation being ruined as a result of this incident. After all, he is at fault, and he has to bear the consequences of his mistakes. If he is truly repentant, he should acknowledge the harm he has inflicted on his victims and withdraw from school."
