55197,"Just want to get something off my chest. There's this friend, who has always been there for me through tough times and supporting me as I deal with my mental health. Here's the cliche moment. I find myself increasingly attracted to him but he's already attached. I've never dated before, and I try to find someone I'm interested in (dating apps included). But somehow I can't help but think about him, especially when theres such a stigma still surrounding mental health, and its hard to have friends to understand and stick with you through everything. He's a really great guy. Everything between us has been and will still be platonic, and I have no intention of changing our friendship despite the attraction. He is also open with his gf who understands he's just being a supportive friend. We're just meeting occasionally when in school to talk, and I don't want to distance myself or stay away, as I do need someone who understands me that I can talk to, especially during the times where I am distressed.
I know it's wrong to allow myself to like him and to think about him that way. Why is it so hard to control feelings? I like him because of his reliability and consideration, and I feel comfortable confiding in him, but it's also something that someone out there may have. Its just, after so long I still can't get over him even when I bury my feelings deep, deep down. Fellow girls, how to you try to get over someone? I just want to go back to seeing him as a good friend."

Whether to cut loss depends on things like whether you need this sum of money in the near future for a wedding, house, loan, etc. Next, it also depends on your reason for entering into nvda - investing or trading. 

If it's investing based on fundamental values, reassess it's value again based on its recent balance sheets and decide for yourself from there whether to sell it. If it's still fundamentally sound and you don't need the money in the near future, you can consider holding on to it for the long term. 

If it's for trading, I'll personally cut my loss and take this lesson as paying school fees to the market for not setting a stoploss. For trading, holding onto a trade that goes against your setup has an opportunity cost of entering into other money making trades. At the end of the day, dyodd  and this post should not be an indication to buy/ sell. All the best!"

A carrot, an egg and ground coffee beans were placed into three pots of boiling water for 20 minutes. Each face the same adversity - boiling water, but each reacted differently. 

After 20 minutes, the item in each pot are so follow:
1. The hard carrot became soft.
2. The fragile egg became hardened.
3. The ground coffee bean changed the water into fragrant coffee.

When adversities knock on your door, how would you respond?

A. Are you the carrot that seemed strong, but with pain and adversity became soft, admit to defeat and give up easily?

B. Are you the egg that started with a soft and sensitive heart but became hard-hearted and unfeeling after going through hardships?

C. Are you the coffee bean that changed the very circumstances that bring pain, fully demonstrating your great innate potential?

55178,"I have a Friend (I’ll be referring to him as G) who’s in love with this girl and it’s a complicated relationship to say the least. The gist of how it started was that the girl confessed to G bout how she likes him,G started to talk to her, allegedly both fell in love with each other but due to circumstances, could not (and still cannot) be together. They text regularly but from what I’ve heard he hasn’t seen her in a very long time. 

G is very passionate and has a tendency to put people first, in the ways that he thinks matters, like buying them meals often. So In the case of this girl, he is so smitten with that he straight out splurges on her. Just yesterday, he bought a charm that cost him a chunk of his salary (he’s an intern - you can imagine his allowance). He’s done this several times for her.

What I don’t understand is that he tells me that she doesn’t act like she cares. Like she only thinks of herself. Doesn’t ask about him at all when they text and he tells me that hurts him, because he’s not sure of her feelings towards him and whether it’s the same as it was before. He tells me he wants to get out of this - whatever this relationship is - but at the same time he tells me he loves her and because he’s so empathetic and passionate he’s afraid she will “break” if he ends this. And he wants to always put her first. He has also told me his logical side is telling him not to continue but his emotional side is telling him to keep in touch with her. I tell him to actually tell her that he’s unhappy - at least she might be more aware but he doesn’t want to because he says he’d rather see her being “happy and oblivious” than to try. 

Can anyone help me understand this? 

J, if you’re seeing this, and I know you browse this site regularly, I don’t know if you’re just plain oblivious to this or looking for him only when you need him for your own benefit, but just know that just because you’re “not obligated to do anything” doesn’t mean you can take advantage of him and use him as your emotional footstool.

I am sorry I am not good with girls and their thoughts, so I really couldn't help with your concern. But I was concerned with how your friends view you as thirsty and desperate, which also resonated with me. I am the guy who shared a depression story weeks ago, in which I sunk to a low due to fear that I would never get a girlfriend or get married for the rest of my life, and I had to continuously talk to my friends who advised me that I am alrd starting to think about midlife crisis way before I am in my midlife, and that my thinking is very selfish and insensitive to girls.

My current predicament stems from confidence and physique problems, but you are definitely on the right track, actively meeting and talking with new people to establish connections. I know I am not qualified to say this, but I suggest to keep your hopes up and not worry about being hard-to-get or cheap. Most importantly (as I feel) is to take your time and wait for that moment when you find a guy whom you have special chemistry with. Finding your Mr. Right will be more fulfilling than desperately rushing and regretting it."

To the OP of #55125:

Thank you for making us realize that it is ultimately not the course that an individual takes but their own CHARACTER that defines them as a person. I do hope you realize that soon too!

It was so heartwarming to see so many people jumping into action to defend the CEG curriculum and the students! Like there was a SOC prof (who incidentally is well-versed in both CS + EE stuff), an ECE lecturer, another SOC prof. Heck, even CS students and EE students came to help out the CEG students who just got unfairly bashed for no reason.

Meanwhile, I couldn't seem to find any ""friend"" of yours who supported the unique viewpoint that you have. It seemed like suddenly the CS students wanted to distance themselves from this bigoted narrow perspective. In fact, I think CEG and CS students are generally very friendly towards each other, given the many similarities in the nature of our courses!

I was actually quite surprised to see the camaraderie that EE and CEG students share! I guess it's because of the fact that we all part of the ECE family =) Thank you all, my friends!

Life has always been a competition from the very beginning. Not a struggle of the fittest....a struggle of the smartest.

From primary to sec to JC, it's just studying and working harder and harder. We rejoice when we can get to a top uni like NUS, only to bemoan when we see how stressful uni is yet again.

I remember my sec school teacher once trying to motivate by saying 'just keep working hard then you can finally relax.'

Relax? What relax? You get good grades, end up with a good job with good pay, but again, you're working even harder in the working world. Especially for jobs that have a lousy work-life balance. 

What's the point in life if all we do is work? Money? What money when we can hardly spend it? Money can't buy you happiness. It's how you truly choose to live your life which brings you happiness. Isn't it?

Give up while you are in your twenties and feel inferior for the rest of your life? Or start working hard to catch up? And don't say you are working hard because you spend 3 days on 1 chapter -- I'm pretty sure you spent 80% of that time on Instagram or Facebook instead of actually studying or you are merely reading through the notes without digesting or applying the information. Think about how you can work more efficiently rather than whine about the fact that some people are born more intelligent than you.
To people who say that your grades don't matter in the workplace -- that is true to a large extent. What does matter in the workplace is your work ethic.
