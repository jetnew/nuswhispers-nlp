Actually it’s not NUS at fault here. It’s the company who manages them. They are the ones who came up with strict and ridiculous policies. Cleaners in NUS are not directly employed by NUS"
54693,To #54671: Congrats. Now you have made NUS think they are overpaying the cleaners since they are not working throughout their shift. Either some of them will have to go or the cleaning company will dispatch some of them somewhere which could be even more inconvenient or tough for them

54689,"Everyone looks forward to Fridays or the weekends, except me. 

I don't have friends to go out with. I hate looking through my social media to see people hanging out at clubs, restaurants or any other lepak spots and enjoy their weekend nights. I spend mine at home. Sometimes I do enjoy the alone time, especially when the week really is very tiring due to school. But too much alone time can be very frustrating and depressing too. I do go out on my own sometimes, but standing by yourself in a crowd can feel pretty lonely too. This is especially when people think why this girl is sitting or walking around alone on a weekend night. 

So whenever Friday comes, my mood just drop drastically. I hate waking up on Friday mornings, knowing I have to survive through this day and the two weekends, and hope for Monday to arrive fast. "
54687,"Usually when new profs teach a mod, does the bellcurve trend from previous batches follow up? 

Like even if the syallabus they teach, on paper, is the same as the previous batch, but the materials are quoted not necessarily from the same sources, and the style of questions from the past year papers are not the same(or possibly we don't even know what style is it since he's totally new). Would the lack of practice resources for the ""new prof"" affect the bell curve, and if so, is it for a steeper bell curve or a gentler bell curve?"

But all in all, now that I look back, I think I can say: “We messed up, but it’s okay. Maybe we both could have done each other better, but it doesn’t matter.” What if we had stayed together, certain things might not have happened throughout the course of the semester. I might not have ended up where I am. And I know I would be bummed missing out on those things that occurred to me.

No, I’m not newly attached. Yet if I am given the chance to go back in time, I wouldn’t change a single thing that happened. So if you are reading this and realise it’s about you (since you’re a smart guy), I just want you to know that it’s okay."

I honestly am appalled at the organisation of the whole course, it's very badly organised and planned and to me it feels like just another kind of scheme to milk ppl off their money just for some educational pursuit. I don't feel that it can actually add any value to my resume after having been thru one module so far. Anyone can shed light on the usefulness of a specialist diploma? Thanks in advance."

54661,"In reply to post #54568, 
Honestly, the replies to this post really disgusted me. How can ppl be so unsympathetic towards others, and judge others so quickly? So yes a depressed gf is likely to be portrayed as the victim, but have they considered what it's like to be in the bf's shoes?
.
Recently I've become a close confidant for a friend (A) whose partner (B) suffers from bipolar disorder and depression, and B's disorders are pretty severe. B MUST be around A all the time (I am not exaggerating), and if A is not physically present (bc of class etc), A must continue to be available for B via text, or have a legit reason whereby A cannot use his/her phone (eg exam). After which, A must immediately account back to B to assure B that he/she is not leaving her/him. B also sends A to A's classes, so that they will spend maximum time tgt. To make matters worse, they live together (in hall), so A can't simply lie that he/she is in his/her room when he/she has been going out elsewhere. Why? Because to B, there are only 2 scenarios: A wants me, or A doesn't want me (and hence A chooses other things like listening to lessons or going out with friends, over spending time with me). 
.
I've advised A that it is a seriously toxic relationship. B has become so dependent on A, that whenever A ""disappears"", B does sth rash like cutting him/herself, or threatening to commit suicide.
.
Can you imagine being in the shoes of A? Yes, B needs help, and we offer him/her our sympathy, but who are we to judge A for being a ""bad partner"" bc he/she needs his/her alone time and to have somebody rely on you 24/7 is absolutely mentally taxing? How would you feel if every little action of that you do can potentially cause someone to take their life?
.
A has ever confided to me that he/she has contemplated just letting B take his/her life, because A really cannot deal with the amount of stress B is causing for A. A acknowledged that it is a selfish act, but there are limits to people.
.
So maybe I can't offer a solution to A's and B's problems. But PLEASE be more mindful of the words that you type and speak. You never know what others are going through. 

TLDR: You shouldn't judge the bf so quickly without even knowing his side of the story

(And for those who are curious, B is already seeking treatment for the disorders, but it is not helping.)"

54655,"I've knew this guy for almost 8 years and we've been dating for around 6 months. Although we have knew each other for so long, but we've only gotten closer in the past 1-2 years. 

But anyway I'm just really confused nowadays because he treats me well when we're together (face to face), but then he takes days to reply my texts (like maybe 3 days on average) and only texts me to meet up. Sometimes when I don't text him, he'll also be okay with it. There was once that I wanted to see if he noticed that I wasn't texting him anymore, it took him almost a week to text me (to set up a date) . 

Communication is the key right? I told him that I'm a little upset sometimes because he rarely texts me unless I text him first, and that he takes super long to reply. But he just says he's busy with school and that's the end of it. I get it, you don't have to always be texting me 24/7 though, I just want to know how you're doing especially when we can't meet up because of our schedules... Is it really that difficult to send a message?

54653,"Having been studying in NUS bizad for several years, I can safely come to a conclusion that the school I am in is filled with pragmatic, conceited and condescending human beings. 

This is generalisation - but most Finance students I talk to signal the characteristics  I mentioned above. Talk to them about JP Morgan, Citi, Goldman, Credit Suisse and you can see their mouth watering. Divert the conversation to none of these banks and they would not give you any attention. 

Me: “I would love to work in *name of company*. They were recently acquired by  the Tencent! It is gonna be an exciting future for them.”

Finance guy: “Sorry dude. I’m not interested. The pay is shit right? Eh you know I pass the Morgan Stanley interview right!”. 

After talking a bit more about banking, the conversation comes to an end. 

The conversation I have with finance students is always about these career opportunites in major investment banks. That’s totally fine because that’s your interest. But it gets tiring overtime when it’s always about YOU. It’s always about high salary. It is always about the prestige that comes with it. I don’t find these important. But when I want to talk about my interests, suddenly no one bats an eye.

We need to have more diversity in school - people who can bring different values and achievements. This school is not a factory that produce cookie-cutter, homogenous products. There should be a balance between creativity and conscientiousness.

One possible reason would be Biz symplicity. The portal should be more targeted for students for their respective major. The email blast for year 1 and year 2 should provide a balance between finance, operations, entrepreneurship, marketing, hr, analytics, economics, etc. To date, the portal uploads general job posts that are mostly in the finance field. Non-finance students are bombarded by emails that are really irrelevant. This gives an impression to students that the job available out there are mostly in finance - which is not true. Many students are not interested in banks but because of fear of not being able to get a job and the stigma attached with some majors, they are succumbed in the end.

Interviews should also be conducted to gain admission. I am aware that some interviews have already been done for selected students but it should be applied to all students. This is to identify candidates who are really passionate about the respective business fields. SMU employs this method and this allows the University to have a diverse student body that has several interests. "

I mean, yes by right I'm supposed to be grateful for his benevolence (?) if he thinks he is being benevolent by extending the deadline out of nowhere. But I'm feeling extremely disturbed? upset? by this as I've worked hard in order to complete the essay on time amidst the mad rush for all other deadline. I could have spent more time on other submissions if I knew this would be extended?? 

This extension without consulting the students seems to me an unfair decision made solely by the prof. I know of other profs who would ask their students about their opinions on whether it's ok to extend the deadline. Because they know it's unfair to the rest of the students who complete their assignments on time, and with this extension, it only gives those people who do ""last minute work"" more time.

Uni is competitive and I'm extremely sorry for being so competitive as well, but isn't this very unfair to a part of the students? Though life is unfair to begin with.

54609,"Perspective from current year 4 NTU Math student
(Wrote it here since some may not follow NTU confession at the same time, thus not going to post on NTU confession)

1) Personal Experience
Before NS, I am offered NTU accountancy and I accepted it. After NS, I realised this is not what I want as I have enjoyed math and love how the logic in math works. Finally, did a switched to NTU math. I have 100% no regrets. Is the best choice in my life to ditch accountancy. I am now planning to go for PhD in math too.

I think there is really too much inaccurate publicity and overhyped about biz accountancy and finance. Biz school (and even computer science school) is attracting many students who actually will excel better if they have chosen other disciplines. Is really sad that some students just think of practicality and money, rather than their own aptitude and interest.

2) Value of a Math Degree
I have completed my minor in finance in NTU biz school. I can safely say that math modules are so much more fun, challenging, and mentally stimulating. Math degree will give you the tools to model any real world problems with mathematical models and sound logic. Biz school focus more on using the current financial theories develop by scientist and mathematicians, then write company financial analysis report, etc. In other words, focus of biz school is on presentation to clients, that's why biz school modules almost always have presentations as marking criteria. If you are someone who love the logical thinking in math, then degree in math is really what will help you to capitalise on your strengths in math to solve real world problems.

3) Employability
I have taken 2 internships. 1 with DSTA as data analyst intern, 1 with DSO as research intern. By the way, the internship pay and starting full time pay of these 2 organisations are well above the average. As I have interned there before, there is really a high chance of me getting employed full time with them if I want to. There are really many interesting projects that SG is currently embarking on that requires the skill sets of a math major. Especially since SG pushing for smart nation now. In fact, there is a trend that increasingly more math majors are recruited to take part in projects involving big data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. And with recent cyber attacks, there is great focus on cybersecurity and cryptography now. These are all sunrise industries. To really take advantage of this wave of 4th industrial revolution, you need a major that give you the quantitative skills and logical reasoning skills. These skills are what math majors are really good at. Don't misinterpret what biz schools sometimes say that they focus on training quantitative skills of their students. Biz school quantitative skills is simply accounting type of simple calculations, and also memorising formulae to use it to find the values etc. Is really mundane and boring for me after taking 4 finance mods, and compare against all my math modules. If you are more interested in the theories behind the formulae and want to learn how to model complex real world scenarios with advanced math, then math major will be the best choice to train you in your quantitative skills.

(4) NTU Math or NUS Math
The key difference is NTU Math put you through a common math curriculum for the first 1.5 years, so that you can get a feel of all the different types of math. This will aid you in choosing specialisation after this 1.5 years. Our 4 specialisation are pure math, applied math, statistics, business analytics. For me, initially I wanted statistics since I heard that actuarial science is a lucrative industry to go to and since I am good at math, so why not give it a go. But after taking the 1st module in statistics in the first 1.5 years of common curriculum, I realised that I am not suitable for statistics. I just can't seem to visualise how to form double and triple integrals to find probability for multi variables. Eventually, I chose applied math, as I realised during my 1st year that I like coding and computational thinking very much. My main point is a lot of times before u enter uni, u may have some perception of certain disciplines and areas of math. It is when you really start to try out each discipline in much more detail then you will realise what type of math suits you more. Thus, just be open minded in your 1st year studying math. Enjoy the fun of learning math in university, while identifying which area of math you are more interested in. I would say both NUS and NTU have really good learning environment, and math curriculum are really very similar. You are in good hands when you join either NUS math or NTU math.

Hope this helps to answer some of doubts of potential math majors! Math is fun, useful, challenging. Do something you enjoy, so you wouldn't have to dread the time you studying in uni."

To whoever that wrote this, and many like-minded friends out there, I hope what I am sharing would deter you from this unhealthy path of eating disorders.
I am a recovering anorexic patient who had an eating disorder since I was 13 years old. 
Before everything started, I was an avid swimmer who took part in many youth competitions. I enjoyed sports and being out in the sun with my friends. In my primary 6 report book my teachers wrote: “lively” “sporty” “optimistic”. I had near perfect attendance. It was a really good time for me.
Long story short, I developed an eating disorder in secondary 1 and all the above went away. 
Being anorexic, you will not be truly happy. Yes, maybe temporary satisfaction when you see your weight drop and your bones start to appear visible under your skin. But, you will never ever be skinny enough for your standards. Each time I stood in front of the mirror all I could see was “where else I could loose weight” and not how skinny I was. Almost every moment of your day will be haunted by restricting calories, exercise, and the excruciating hunger that you try so hard to resist. This cycle, once you’re in it, trust me, its not easy getting out. 
If the detrimental mental effects don’t scare you enough, let me tell you the real physical consequence of an eating disorder. 
Gastritis – Really painful stomach aches as gastric acid digests your stomach instead of food.
Gastric reflux – due to long periods of purging after meals, painful as well
Cardiomyopathy – as your heart starts to break down; feeling tired, out of breath all the time
Sadly, these are just some of the few that I can share from my own experience. Just do a quick google search, many more will pop up. Unfortunately, many of these conditions will continue to plague you even after you start eating better. 
I am writing this post because I am starting to really regret having this eating disorder now that I am in uni. Seeing all my hallmates going for training and playing in IHG really made me wish I could join them, but I can’t without gasping for air after just a few minutes of physical activity. A common cold is all that it takes to make my body shut down and send me to the ER. 
So, if you are thinking that its cool being anorexic, it’s not. Being fed with a tube down your nose is not fun. There are healthier ways to get that toned and fit body via eating right and working out. 
For those that are still battling with eating disorders, I wish you all the best. Remember, there is help, you just need to reach out. UHC maybe a good place to start.
