55699,Took CS2040 this sem and it’s probably THE BEST module I’ve ever taken. Thanks to prof Harold for being such a great lecturer! I only wish that the lectures were webcasted so I could watch them again in my spare time :)

55695,"Any seniors out there who graduated from life science can give an insight about the job scopes for this course?

55692,"Just my thoughts on university degrees and workplace practicality: It doesn't matter.

Unfortunately (or fortunately), I had the chance to work since a young age of 14. Through a series of part-time work, internship, overseas volunteering and NS, I've noticed that one's educational qualification is never a good indicator of one's performance on the job or job ethics. I've met people without degrees and most of the time, they perform much better than scholars at the workplace. At the end of the day, it's your soft skills that matters. Skills that the school does not teach you explicitly that will bring you further ahead in life. Cheers and happy holidays!"
55689,"Okay exam is over. But I am paranoid that I would fail the modules. Sian, must wait till 26th Liao."
55688,"Based on the recent confessions and comments, it appears to me that the impression of engineers is bad and engineers are rather looked down upon. But we are bunch of people with some of the best grades to enter the faculty? And it is one of the toughest faculty to get good grades in? And we are very important for building of infrastructure (physical, digital, etc)? Why is it that people see us worse than graduates from FASS? I realise that only in Singapore that engineers get looked down upon like that. Engineer is a one of the top/prestigious profession everywhere else in the world yet in Singapore, people give us zero respect.

What can be done so that Singaporeans would view engineers in a better light and start looking at us as equals to doctors and lawyers? :( "

55679,"#55679 It's not a finals only mod, but the cohort size is small and the prof has pretty much mentioned that there will always be people retaking it :/… It's a 2k mod, I'm not sure if I can SU it.

Didn't think I'd be one of the people retaking it though :'-)

I don't get how people who barely put in any effort and do the bare minimum like simply showing up for lecture and tutorial can do well enough to get a B? I do that and go beyond that to do practice questions, spending most of my time studying with my friends but we never seem to do well? These smart people sometimes don't even show up on time for lectures, and even if they're early all they do is chill in the LT, and then leave as soon as the lecture is over. 

It's not fair to us at the bottom that smart people push up the bell curve so it's harder to score a B, is it? I don't think they even put in half as much effort as we do.

55678,"Regarding the Arts and Social Sciences thing...

I was from Engine. And I am now working in a field totally unrelated to it. I feel that whatever I have studied is not relevant. Basically, if you don't work in a field related to your study, you are even more useless than FASS people.

In fact, those FASS colleagues of mine, their knowledge is sometimes more useful. They are better at articulating and seeing things in a totally different light. It is just damn impressive whenever they bring out sharp alternative perspectives. Those perspectives often result in fundamental shift in company directions/preferences. 

Granted, they can't really execute the shifts due to their lack of technical skills, but i guess that's why many are in civil service doing policy planning. Just look at how intense our 30-year plans can be.

I don't know. Their value cannot be captured easily by a line in resume or a cert. It's really ""cannot see it clearly but can feel it strongly"". 

It's hard to put a price tag on it. But their role are damn important i tell you.

So all the best FASS kids!

55677,"Admin, please do not filter this. I do not understand what is with all these blind hate about arts degrees. If you really want to be so disparaging about it, then let us put things into crude perspective. 1) Are science degrees any better? As far as I know, your science degrees have even worse value than arts degrees, since a) you do not have the soft skills that HR recognises in arts degrees nowadays and b), laboratory positions are so limited that I am sure they are not keen on just a bachelors of science and c) your body of knowledge is even more niche than the arts and social sciences (say, Political Science, Global Studies, History etc) to even be connected to the real world (and do not tell me about pharmaceuticals - get a MSc or a PhD then you say). 2) Let us follow the stereotypical notion of arts degree holders only having teaching to turn to. Hey, why not right? Arts subjects are always in demand in the teaching service anyway. As far as I know, science and math teachers are already hypersaturated in numbers in the service. So who is more at a disadvantage now? Arts or science? I think people are just jealous that there is always that 'stereotypical' job that awaits arts people since you 'useful' degree holders can go on jobless for months given such a competitive job market that you all are very proud of. Since you started the ball rolling, let me go on. How about business degrees? Well, one does not need a business degree to even start a business right? Okay, you may then say how about professions like auditing and accounting and etc. Well, I just do not like to have my life sapped away by such styles of work and thus even if I could do a business degree I'd rather do an academic degree that I know I will enjoy (i.e. History, Literature, etc etc)? You see, you all claim that one can simply read up privately and be on par with arts degree holders in terms of critical thinking and knowledge. Don't be delusional honey. I am sure my fellow FASS people would generally agree that the level of critical thinking and intellect in faculties beyond FASS is just sorely lacking. Look at yourself in the mirror please. That if you can sprout so much nonsense in dissing arts degrees, your EQ is probably just not that high I guess. But it is okay, it is just that our education has failed you and thus breeding off an defective product like you. At the end of the day, do not project your inferiority complex of not being able to handle arts at university upon us. =)"
55676,"Feels like all the friends I have in school now are just sem-only friends, so when the holidays come they go and find their other, ""closer"" friends or S/Os and leave me completely alone. How I wish I had friends that I could go out with, that also have me at the top of their lists rather than the bottom. Guess I'll have to wait for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to erase the loneliness I feel in my heart... 

Sometimes I wish I had friends that saw me the way I see them. "
55675,"I am the OP of #55652. I know that my post has offended a lot of people. I am from FASS and have faced a lot of questions from many people on why I chose an arts/social science course. Initially I felt really discouraged because the looks on people's faces revealed that they felt that I chose the wrong course. The general impressions of students from FASS are that we are lazy, unmotivated, we study fluff, we chose it because it is an easy degree. At first it was really difficult to accept these perceptions and I do feel sad when I hear those comments. However, after some time, I no longer feel anything when others give me the puzzled look when I tell them I am from FASS. When we say arts or social science degree is a general and flexible degree and it allows us to go anywhere, is it really true? Do we really have what it takes to go anywhere with our lack of practical skills? Given that FASS intake is so huge (around 1600 people), the competition is really intense. The thought of competing with 1600 people in FASS for employment alone is really scary. Without practical skills, can FASS students really survive in the working world? "

55667,"@#55664 yo, imagine if someone said ""just use the internet"" for learning anything STEM. I realize that ""just browse the internet"" is a common sentiment for arts, and it's bizarre to me. 

I have no doubt that you are well-versed in history, and I myself am not from a history background, so I'm not qualified to comment on that. However, I do know plenty of people who think that, hey, if I like casually reading books, then I love literature, and I'm on par with lit majors. But reading isn't analysing. Anyone can read a storybook lol, analysis is a whole other thing. Why do people think it is so easy to ""self-major"" in anything arts-related? 

To give a STEM example, would you hire someone who claims to have learnt engineering off the internet, and has nothing else to show for it? Sure, you can self-learn stuff like coding, but that doesn't apply to every STEM major. Similarly, for arts, would you hire someone who claims to have learnt psych off the internet, to be a psychologist? 

The way that arts presents itself as accessible is a good thing, and I completely support people who treat it only as a hobby. But nowadays there are lots of hobbyists whose only info is youtube videos, and they think they are experts...
And they ask why people major in any arts field, when clearly you can just watch youtube videos... These also tend to be the ones who say that arts research is written only to ""sound smart"" and ""impress other philosophers"", because they can't understand it. 

Lastly, I believe that everyone has differing aptitudes. Yes, generally, arts has a lower employment rate and salary (by the way, did you know both stats are even lower for life science?). However, we are not all perfectly average people who are perfectly average in our every trait. To give an analogy-- did you know that most people who won the olympics for shooting, did it with their right hand? Does this mean i should start shooting with my right hand? No, I'm left-handed.

A more on-topic example: you are very good at geography and you love it, but you are very bad at engineering and hate it. In that case, why should it matter to you that the general population generally, on average, earns a bit more as engineers? That's a generalization, a median or mean (depending on what you look at). You are you. If you are absolutely the top of the geog cohort, you could end up being paid decently for working in that field, and have a fulfilling life doing what you love (I'm not a geog major so this is just an example). It certainly seems much better than barely passing through 4 years of engi while being absolutely miserable, and then be stuck in a job you hate for the rest of your life, never being promoted and ultimately earning less. 

So to everyone, stop letting general trends dictate your life. You may not be a representative sample of the general population, so that's just absurd. If you are great at it and you love it, do it. After all, if you are way better at it than most people, why should advice given to average people even apply to you? And please, self-declared expertise is a trend that needs to stop. "

I do agree with what you wrote to a certain extent. Many of us studying in FASS do know that we are studying something impractical. Let's just be honest about it. Arts is fluff. Do consider the intake of FASS too where it is around 1700 people. 1700 people with no marketable skills fighting for jobs? Those who want to come to FASS-please take this factor into consideration too. At the end of the day, for A-level graduates, it is your life. Do plan ahead for the future.

It's raining and it's midweek, so one of my interns told me about this post and it hit me dearly to heart. Wanted to give two cents to my juniors to gain have a wider perspective. Was from Fass and majored in economics and philosophy (closest there was to PPE about 6 years back) - would this be considered getting caught in the same trap twice according to OP haha. 

Left nus with a regular honors. My grades were decent at best compared to my peers, but I managed to clinch an average paying marketing job, before my graduation actually. Fast forward till today, I'm sitting in my personal office with my name branded on the glass wall in the heart of cbd. Unfortunately I can't divulge my roles and where I am for obvious reasons but my ex nus/ntu interns would definitely know my story. Currently a partner in one of the bigger consulting firms.

Hardwork, network and even more hardwork is what I had to put in and fight for to get to where I am. Countless forgone weekends and sleepless nights was the price. Getting a reputable degree can only give you that much head start. Many of my clients were ex fass graduates and some were even from fortune 500 companies.

To my fellow arts undergrads  juniors, every discipline is important. Most hr departments hire across various disciplines, they would be unwise not to. Hardwork and discipline is the only mantra you should get an A+ in. Cap5? Probably not as impt.

The toilet cubicals are ridiculously small, and there are always insects on the walls of the cubicals. Not to mention the shower head is so short it’s almost always touching my head. 

But there’s no other place to stay, is there? If you’re a year 3 or 4 it’s highly unlikely any hall will accept you in because of priority given to freshmen. I really wish there were more residence options on campus. "
55618,"Help pls. I fainted today on my way to my examination. I got a medical certificate, then called my prof and he said to apply for special consideration because there is no re-test. I then checked to see what the information required were, and basically I needed the doctor to fill in some additional comments. (So I'm probably going to the doctor again). The thing is, my doctor told me to go to A&E since I hit my head a little bit, and I have fainted before in 2014 and 2016. I personally don't think it's a huge issue and it's probably due to stress or lack of sleep. So I end up being afraid that if I go to the hospital and tests say I'm fine, would that make my situation even worse? What if the school thinks I faked illness or something? Not to mention going through all the tests would be expensive af >< 

Also, if I happen to pass the module without counting the finals (although I doubt it since its 45%), would my grade be incomplete or would it be the grade that has passed? 

Anyone has advice? Especially if you have ever missed an examination in NUS for whatever reason? ):

Lately, I couldn't find the courage to stay on sane one second from breaking down internally day by day.. Instead of staying by your side, I will put you into my thoughts that you will be alright one day.. I'm sorry that I have to leave to find back myself at least a smile that I lost these years.. "
55614,Hi im a real estate 3rd year undergraduate..desperately need advice from real estate seniors/graduates on how useful the module re2301(GIS FOR REAL ESTATE) is as i am planning to take it next semester. Is it hard? Will it be difficult to manage given that i have no knowledge in GIS at all? thank you!
55613,#55613: MOE publishes the statistics of starting salaries of all majors (just google NUS graduate employment survey). Accountancy graduates are actually paid a bit less than the graduates of most engineering majors.
55612,"I’m so jealous of my former schoolmates who have found their careers which are also their passions. Some in civil service, some in military, some in IT, some in law, some in teaching, some in medicine, some in dentistry, some in business. 

I’m turning 24 soon. I do work part time on things I like. It does bring me some money, but that is not really a stable career. 

That anxiety is real. I haven’t really found my lifelong career yet. Some people can foresee themselves still being a doctor, a dentist, a teacher, a business owner at the age of 40, 50. For me, I don’t even have an idea of where I will be when I’m 30. Anyone here faces the same situation? "

55601,"Sitting inside the ever-so-crowded Starbucks once again, I cannot believe that I am back here more than a year after the end of my undergraduate days, with a Masters to spare and uncertainty at the top of my head. And I'd thought I'd just be back here in Utown for a day or two, but it had been two or three days every week since that return from my year-long adventure 11000 kilometres away.

It's as if I'm 'omnipresent', once again.

For I cannot escape the reality, that university has always been a comfort space for me, to rethink and re-calculate my direction for the present and future.

It was in NUS where I roamed around with great aplomb, taking pictures and memories with every passing year. I still fondly recall the rush of adrenaline that sinks in with every orientation camp; where the youthful energy that I see in the eyes of every university student sinks into me, where it promises me that there is hope in this generation that I belong in, where we have the capacity to make and change the world and turn it into a better place. I fervently loved every photograph that I made in this university landscape, so much so that it had inspired my ensuing research, for it became something that had become a part of me for the rest of my life. And I feel so privileged to have known thousands of people of whom I will regrettably never know in detail, yet who pops out at every corner of the school and greet me with an enthusiasm that had worn off from my soul, a greeting that reminds me that I did something impactful, meaningful, and possibly noteworthy in nature.

In NUS had I managed to reclaim and rebuild my social standing, from the days of my wretched past school life. In NUS had I managed to find an inspiration and a way of contributing to society, and remind myself that I was actually somewhat important and had the potential to change and influence the world somehow, even in the midst of my current uncertainty that lurks in me as I navigate another job interview that ends in failure. And in NUS, had I managed to find a faculty so worth defending and of which had I managed to contribute a geographical and 'photographical' history and made a research interest out of it. I had done what I did, pursued my photography adventures here time and time again because I owe my rather crazy - and tremendously brilliant and colourful - faculty for all that they had inspired me.

And I will owe this, for the rest of my life.

For sometimes, it made me cry inside with tears of joy - and tears of self-importance. For I am as vulnerable as so many of you out there - the aspiring busker, influencer or henna artist, the self-doubting entrepreneur or the future public/civil servant and MOE teacher that propagates around me ever so often. I, like many of you, crave so furiously within for that recognition and reassurance that I always felt I lacked, of which I still feel in short supply with seemingly infinite deficiency. But as I look back on every poignant orientation camp that I've talked about endlessly like an old person on his/her last decade of his/her life, I cannot help but thank every senior and junior who had been a part of this amazing journey of mine, whenever I run into each of you in school or otherwise. This is what I owe all of you, the you who's struggling to stay afloat in finals that's concluding really soon and in every academic semester, the you who straddled into my life path or photograph or geographical landscape, the you who were part of this university fabric, the you who somehow inspired this very vulnerable soul who just wanted to fit into society and yet who constantly felt too different, too out-of-place, too dispensable. You, are so important to me, in words beyond essays, in words beyond photographs, in words, beyond existence.

Now here I was earlier yesterday, sitting in the Utown Green sipping another cup of bubble tea, staring out into another night here and enjoying the silence that I feel with utmost ease. I'd learned to be comfortable on my own and enjoy my personal company in a society that's in constant flux and endless change. I'm still juggling my personal struggles in finding a job (it's been 3 months and I feel like I'm not trying hard enough while doing so in vain), hearing of my contemporaries and juniors getting married or engaged a pair at a time, and feeling my batchmates in university grow increasingly distant and completely exclusive with every passing moment of work life. It's as if, I'm always left behind time and time again. Yet I find it alluring - and addictive - to be quite different, sitting here and finding my feet in a space that I also call a home and an atmosphere of recovery. My time in the picturesque and comforting English seaside towns and that peaceful Swedish cemetery had further trained me to ease my soul, and I hope that you all could feel the silence somewhere and somehow, that comforts you like it has done so for me.

I am still fighting my daily battles for my relevance in society, for the pursuit of something that reminds me that I still matter. But this university is the place where I continually seek to rebuild myself, and remind me of glorious and fantastic days past, and the people who were once here and are still here, but of whom will move on, slowly and eventually, like the rustling and fall of leaves with the flow and passing of every season or moment in time. 

To all those who had been a part of my life here, in materiality or in spirit, in space or with time, I wish you all the best once again. You are all in my heart in one form or another, and thank you so much for giving some of the best days of my life. Thank you for reminding and affirming me that I can do something in this confusing world.

I owe this community too much for me to let it go. And I'll never let it slide, for the rest of my life. It means the world and everything to me, and hang in there, wherever you all may ever be.

And I'll be forever grateful.

Always :)"
55600,"Frankly I think that #55578 has some point here. Most of us just want to graduate with a degree and at the same time learn some useful skills to apply to workplace. Not everyone cares about research as much as the professors do and to place a heavy emphasis on research while not focusing on teaching and imparting knowledge to students who mainly pay to learn would be in essence mean that we are producing less capable students, who go on into the economy to work. Some professors are paid highly, but to churn research which benefits university, which in turn boost the rankings of the university, but to be honest, deep down we all know that NUS as asia's #1 university and its worldwide ranking is highly debatable. Tell that to any alumni and they would probably secretly snigger at the thought that NUS is ranked higher than Yale. NUS has been playing this ranking games for the past few years, but frankly speaking, the calibre of its students probably cannot rival those in the top of china such as Tsinghua or Peking university. I have taken the famous MA1512 and many other terribly taught modules in NUS and am not impressed with what the top asia university has to offer. Ultimately, i don't think NUS would care that much about undergrads as much as the grads students as long as research plays a bigger role in the rankings and it remaining as a research university. Also, comments that say that ""don't go university lo"" are not really helping, instead of coming up with toxic comments, why not come up with better solutions to improve the educational landscape?"
