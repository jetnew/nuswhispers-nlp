58096,"Anyone irritated by the poor design of the LumiNUS file downloader? Firstly, you can't select and download files across folders. Secondly, there is no way to see and download files you have not downloaded. Thirdly, there is no way for you to set to receive email notifications when files are uploaded as far as I can tell. For some reason, I am receiving email notifications for one of my mods but not the other. All these were present in the good old IVLE.

Is there a way to provide feedback to the LumiNUS team? Since it is in beta, they should use this opportunity to iron out any functionality issues that users might experience."
58095,"5 stages of grief experienced by Jimmy Fallon when Nicole Kidman revealed to him during his talk show that she had a crush on him many years back. She even took the initiative (through a mutual friend named Ricky) to go to his apartment to hang out. Fallon, being a nobody at that time, was nervous and never dared to imagine he’d have a chance to date Kidman. He stayed awkwardly quiet throughout that encounter and just played his Nintendo. In the end nothing happened. 

All the screenshots were taken during that interview clip (Totally unscripted moment) when Kidman revealed this. 

As V day is fast approaching, hopefully this will be a timely reminder to all the single dudes out there (not gonna elaborate what’s the reminder, I mean, if you don’t get this, just don’t get a girlfriend) 

And also remember Ricky is the worst wingman in the history of mankind. "

58088,"In response to #58014 , if this was really written by a girl then thanks for your honesty (cause the overall tone and style sounds more like it was written by a dude masquerading as a girl), and I would say what's done is done, you're still in your 30s so try and make the most of what's left of your youth, and don't dwell too long on what's past. 

However in response to your post, the fact of the matter is that hindsight is 20/20. From a guy's point of view, I feel that hookup culture and the situation you described is applicable to both sexes. The fact of the matter is that it is becoming harder to enter committed relationships at this age compared to our parents' generation - that's why divorce rates are on the rise. It's not quite as simple as seek and you shall find in relationships these days. So for those struggling to find someone, what I would say is just focus on being the best version of yourself and bringing something to the table in a relationship, and naturally you will have a higher chance of attracting a best match. Relationships at these age are nice, but they are ultimately not some secret formula to happiness and in fact can be a huge ass emotional burden if things go south. Don't place your whole identity in finding him/her, but in finding you. Good luck."
58087,"#58036: common mistake guys like you make is to ask for daring advice from girls. 

Dating advice from girls to guys can be useless or even harmful because they often tell you the politically correct thing instead of hard truths. Also while they can tell you what they THINK a girl wants, they often leave out the important details because they are either unaware or unwilling to state them out. If you are unlucky they might even give you self-serving advice that lowers your odds but benefits them.

For example I am sure your female friends told you that you need to do all kinds of nice things to win that person you like over, what they often neglect to mention is that for all those nice guy wooing things to work you need to be attractive in the first place. You are right that sometimes they just enjoy seeing the drama happen to have something to gossip about. 

If you are a chef do you ask your customer how to cook a meal? No right? The best your customer can do is to roughly describe what they like, and often they will not even know what exactly it is. It is the same with asking for dating advice from girls about girls. There might be some exceptions that really do give good advice but those are few and far between, especially if you are talking about the uni age bracket. 

For the best dating advice, try asking successful men instead. They did what worked and understand the struggles that face a man in the dating marketplace. They are also willing to lay the hard truths on you and be clear about your odds and what you need to do. At the end of the day, a man's journey requires guides that have walked the path themselves.

58070,"#58024:
- longer foreplay, being relaxed, and lose yourself in the situation. Don't think too much.
- Toys is great to experiment to find either the spot or the position that give the best orgasm. Toys are expensive but don't get tired. The most reliable (and discreet) ones I've found are OPSM handheld massagers or similar. Flimsy, cheap toys don't last for long (the motor wears out or something).
- According to Dave Lampert, the inventor of the Sybian (wikipedia it), woman-superior (Girl-On-Top) position works best; and the Sybian is designed for that philosophy. Apparently, that machine is great (according to people who used it), but it costs like >1500 dollars. However, during my experimentation with then boyfriend and now husband, the best and quickest method or orgasm for me is oral and me sitting on his face. Sitting seems to make blood rush to that region more than when I am lying down making it easier.

- Have fun experimentation."

58068,"#58016: As someone who have been through undergrad, work, then grad school, listen, your time and stress during school is nothing compared to work. At school, you can try again on the next test, next semester, or next module. At work, you can be fired.

Count yourself lucky that your girlfriend, despite being vastly more mature than you are right now, in terms of education and work experience, still want to stay with you and have sex with you. So: do your best. She needs that sex to de-stress. Hell, during stressful time at work, I may masturbate in the toilet to clear my head before heading back in. And I am married.

It's more or less your duty to not only have sex with her, but to do it well. Give her the best time she could have. Can't give her orgasm with just penetration? Learn how to do it well. Ask her what she likes. Toys and oral are your friends. There's a joke that women are so needy and they want to cuddle after sex while men just want to sleep. If she does that, you aren't doing it well enough. All the women I've been with, if they get a good orgasm in, they just want to roll over and sleep.

Take my advice: once you start having sex in a relationship, don't stop (unless one of you is physically incapable). One of my relationship fell apart because while we were having sex regularly, we stopped because of an argument (she wanted bareback during her periods, I don't trust her past partners). After we stopped, the frequency of arguments picked up then we broke up."

Once married, the girl has all the power while the guy is at her mercy due to the women’s charter. 

Do you know if your wife cheats on you and you divorce her, you still have to pay her maintenance? 

The real enemy is really the women’s charter. Any girl you marry has a legal gun pointed to your head. You just keep praying she decides not to pull the trigger. You just keep hoping you chose the correct one. You just keep praying she doesn’t change. 

And this is why Singaporean men are all so scared of their wives. "
58042,"Responding to  #58020, just to elaborate on some things you said:

- "" When you ask a feminist the definition for feminism, they will say that it means gender equality but all they fight for would be at the regions where men are *believed* to be at an advantage than women while they totally avoid and ignore the domains where men are clearly at a disadvantage than women."" I don't think this is the only issue. The main issue is that when you ask someone what feminism means, they tend to just say: ""equality"". The problem with that is that it's a very difficult concept to define. The best most of us can do is split it up into equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. I think the major gripe with the current feminist movement is that they are demanding opportunity of outcome, meaning that, regardless of competencies or situations, women should be given the exact same outcomes. For example, the survey and statistics that support the gender wage gap are almost definitely true - women do, on average, earn less than men. Yet, we fail to look at the jobs that men are doing. They are often riskier (risk pay), have worse hours (more hours to pay them) and are more scalable (you can make more money). If you look at the choices men make in their field of study, versus the choices women make, it's pretty clear where a lot of the gender wage gap comes from. Engineering is a great example. The joke is that there are no women there. Okay, true. It's also true that engineers make a lot of money compared to other professions which are a lot more people based (https://www.collegechoice.net/50-highest-paying-careers-college-graduates/). People based professions are absolutely dominated by women (https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/professions-women). This is the problem with demanding opportunity of outcome: it doesn't take into account various factors that influence the outcomes.  Earlier, more traditional feminism on the other hand, demanded equality of opportunity (such as the opportunity to vote), which is obviously the correct thing to do, because these opportunities are fundamental human rights and should be accorded to all persons. 
- ""Eventually, she started saying that men suppressed women for centuries and it's only right for them to go through these hardships for the time being..."" Whilst it's a primal instinct to demand an ""eye for an eye"", it's not necessarily the best thing: you don't follow up evil and malevolence with more of the same. However, this is assuming that the narrative that men have oppressed women is as true as feminist theorists say it is. Whilst there clearly has been oppression throughout history of females, it is nowhere near as pervasive as feminism has made it out to be. The real oppression was the forces of nature and the world versus men AND women. Sure, throughout history women received less rights in many aspects, but it may not just be because of men, it may be because of nature: for thousands of years, there was no reliable or effective contraception - that meant that for a large percentage of their lives, women were pregnant or on their menstrual cycles which did affect their ability to go out and do the hard manual labor jobs of the older days. On the other hand, men suffered just as much, with the death toll of men in wars and other dangerous situations (many of their jobs were inherently risky, and still are) being extraordinarily high.  The point here is that suppression isn't the answer, working together is.

58040,"#58014 I am in the same situation as you. All I can say is take it one day at a time and do the little things that make you happy. Get a dog or cat if it helps. You don’t need to keep accepting all those invites to be jiemei or attend weddings if they make you sad, people will understand.   

One painful thing about being ex-party spinsters like us is this unspoken expectation to keep showing everyone that we are strong, complete and happy even if we are not. I think good men that might consider us can see through this facade and be turned off.   

More of us need to own our bad choices instead of being in denial- it’s the only way we can move forward and improve. It’s good that you are honest with yourself, I don’t think I could say what you did, but you did it for all of us."
58038,"Even long before Fifty Shades of Grey came out, I've always fantasized about having a girlfriend as a submissive. But I feel that I face even more stigma and discrimination than homosexuals when I ""come out"". Friends perceive me as abusive, pervert, sex maniac, the list goes on. But that's not what BDSM is necessarily about. Its about a mutual trust and agreement between two people to engage in power play. And to be specific, I'm just interested in making love with a girl while she's restrained, minus all the spanking.  

If you tell people you are gay, there's still a higher chance that people will accept you. And at least LGBT has got a community for them to turn to where they can identify with others like them and eventually settle down with a soulmate. But till this day, I know not of any girls in NUS or Singapore who fancies or gets turned on being tied up while having sex. Perhaps, I'm the only one in Singapore who is unfortunate enough to be born with such a rare and unfavorably perceived sexual orientation, just like a rare disease. And people always say ""Accept yourself, be who you are"", but I find it hard to do so if I do not want to stay single :(

She has already reflected on her actions and it is really nice of her to share her personal experience with us.

I have 2 friends who used to be party girls too and when they look back on it, both were pretty embarrassed by their past.

However in response to your post, the fact of the matter is that hindsight is 20/20. From a guy's point of view, I feel that hookup culture and the situation you described is applicable to both sexes. The fact of the matter is that it is becoming harder to enter committed relationships at this age compared to our parents' generation - that's why divorce rates are on the rise. It's not quite as simple as seek and you shall find in relationships these days. So for those struggling to find someone, what I would say is just focus on being the best version of yourself and bringing something to the table in a relationship, and naturally you will have a higher chance of attracting a best match. Relationships at these age are nice, but they are ultimately not some secret formula to happiness and in fact can be a huge ass emotional burden if things go south. Don't place your whole identity in finding him/her, but in finding you. Good luck."
58011,"#58011: I understand where you're coming from. But if you think GER1000 is hard? Come over to Biz school... where they're forcing all students to take the extremely hard analytics modules, DAO. It makes GER1000 look like a playground. 

I still don't understand why data science is now a thing in Business School. I mean, from the nature of the subject and if people wanted it, shouldn't this be in Computing school instead?

On the bright side (if I pass, I hope), I'll be able to get a more well-rounded experience from this. Just take GER1000 in the same way. It's better to know some aspects from the technical side instead of sticking to what you're comfortable learning."
58010,"Like #57955,  I don’t think I’m straight too, and I doubt there’ll be much of a place for me if I go all public about this. The real struggle comes from finding a partner though. It is not easy in Singapore "
58009,"When you feel sad, when you feel like crying
You can feel free to call me.
You answer, pretending to be fine
But then you couldn't hide it from me
""Go ahead, tell me""
I reply in my soothing voice

It isn't just your imagining
That you felt the warmth of my touch on your wrist
It feels like I am right next to you

Even the usual words of encouragement
Seem like words heard for the first time
As you place your phone close to your ear

Am I just imagining
That my heart travels far
Maybe I'm just imagining
That it's heading for where you are right now

Whenever and wherever times are hard on you
Feel the strength coming in
As if it were me myself giving it to you
"
58008,"Just to provide a guy's version of #57945:

I was a partyboy during my NUS days and few years after graduation (avg 4 times a week, not sure if that qualifies as partyboy), had more than 20 ONS but never dated anyone during the duration I was clubbing. 

2 years ago when i hit 28, I decided I wanted to get into a serious relationship - stopped partying and started dating. I normally tell the girl my sexual history within 5 dates, so far none of them have turned me down because of it (some just express shock but don't get too hung up over it). 

So yeah, (for guys at least) it's still possible to date when you had a clubbing past, just don't cheat on any1 while you're clubbing. Most girls don't put that as a make-or-break factor when deciding whether to date you. "

If that card is unused then what is the point of having it in the first place? Does the credit card spark joy? If so, maybe you should not have it in the first place. Why can't your debit card spark joy? The money in your debit card is really your money, while the money from a credit card is debt. How debt sparks joy in you I have no idea. Maybe can explain?

Is there any point to having a credit card as a student? Wouldn't you be able to better budget with a debit card than spending and going on a shopping spree online or otherwise with a credit card?"
58003,Why Singaporean guys do not talk to non-Singaporean /exchange girls? Is it thta they're just not interested? How should exchange girls befriend or get to know local guys. 
58002,"i am evergreen and this cny was filled with so many BIG updates within my family. I'm 22 this year. My relatives assumed i've a gf lol..

but reality, i've never dated before.

Anyway, main point is that the big updates are:

my male cousin (16): recently got attached and got out of the evergreen zone..
my female cousin (24): recently got attached after years of being evergreen
my female cousin (30): got attached 2 years ago and now getting married this year

and there's me playing the nice guy card HAHAHAHAHAHA :)"
58001,"If you call random male strangers bro, what do you call random female strangers?"
58000,"Recently, I have been hitting on a guy in my class. We see each other pretty much everyday  but we are not very close. I don’t know if I should push this relationship further as I am in year 3 and I am quite busy with school/training/etc. Also, he is Singaporean and I am not, so I am not sure whether we can overcome the cultural differences. Should I give it a go?"
