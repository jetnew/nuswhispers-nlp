64599,"To #64592, the girl who is asking why your bf didn’t post pics of you and him on social media. 

I used to be in the exact same situation as you back then. But then it came a time when I felt like, why should I let social media control me and us? Yes, I still feel jealous when my friends post sweet pictures of their partners. But slowly, I’ve learned to let go and not let social media controls my relationship. Its a phase that you have to grow out of. Social media is toxic, we let the number of likes and how others perceive us control us so much to the point we pressure our partners. Put yourself in his shoes, how would you feel if he forced you to do something you’re very unwilling to? 

My bf is also a very private person, he deactivated all his social media. He told me that he doesn’t care what the virtual world thinks of him, what’s most important to him is us; and our our relationship in real life. And ever since I don’t let this bother me, I can see that he’s much happier now. He’s being a super sweet bf that he is right now. He changed his wallpaper to our photos now, without me asking him to. When I asked him why he suddenly did that, he said, “I like our picture and I just want to see (us) now.’ 

So, don’t pressure him. I’m sure he will use his ways to show that he loves you as much as you love him. Just that, showing off on the internet, is not his way. ???? Good luck, girl!"
64598,"Feeling very lack of energy everyday. I think I'm having depression; have been taking medicine. Thinking about resigning and taking a rest for a few months, then find another job. What should I do in this case? Prof Ben, can I seek your advice?"
64594,"Dear Prof B and anybody,

Do you have any recommendations for must read books that have changed the way you have seen the world? 

There must be more to life than simply chasing a bigger pay per month. I grow weary of listening to people talking about this perpetual cycle which everyone seems to have bought into."

64590,"@Prof Ben, Steven Halim, Ooi  Wei Tsang. I am a computing student. I just started my internship in data analysis. But I don't really find it super interesting as I hoped. Work life isn't as fun as it sounds. So I was thinking how is the life of a professor? I know it takes 7 years plus to get your PhD. But how is the life? Is there a lot of freedom? How does it compare with working at a company?"
64589,"Can anyone recommend, which chicken rice is best place for lunch in school, among the canteens?"
64588,"Not from CS but hope to seek Prof Ben's advice here. I graduated from NUS recently and accepted an offer from this SME for 2 reasons - a job scope that really interests me and a pay well above industry average. Now, I've been contemplating whether to quit for the past week because I don't see this going anywhere and fear for my career prospect. Instead of letting me spearhead a new project as what was communicated during my interview, I have been just helping out other dept managers with their adhoc work for the past month. Afraid that I won't have anything to show on my resume for my future job if I stay on and this whole period of time here would be a waste but if I leave, I'm afraid that employers would question why I stayed for such a short period and that might reflect badly on me. Rly in need of advice :/
P.S. have asked my boss and was told that a few others have started working on the project so I can just continue helping other managers out. While my boss is nice, he's too busy overseeing all the dept managers to really assign me propert work as well."
64582,"Throughout my entire life, I am always doing what is correct and logical. Study hard and achieve good grades, and made it in the end with a degree in life science. I went on to work in a research lab for a year and applied for PhD because it seem to be a logical next step. But ever since I accepted the offer for PhD, I got so depressed and feel so lost about everything in life. Is this what I want to do? Am I just doing what is the logical next step or am I passionate about what I do? I feel so depressed, lost and unmotivated."
64579,"Currently doing a software dev internship 9-6 everyday. I feel like I’m getting quieter and more introverted, like i dont really talk in office throughout the day, nor did I have anyone to talk to after work. This feels so different than during term time when friends were just down the corridor in hall, and i was definitely more outgoing. I’m not sure if this is just work/adult things, or coding 6 hours a day is really changing my personality. How to not fall into the programmer stereotype?"
64578,"Just curious to know, which dating app have you guys had the most success with? I’ve tried OKC, Tinder and CMB and nothing serious ever sprouts. It’s either no replies or ephemerally superficial conversations. Perhaps it’s just me"
64576,After so long I still miss my ex. He hurt me so much but why I can’t get go. Is it I’m missing the status of having someone to like?
64573,"Anyone has any insights as to why it is so hard to get a date in the Singapore workplace compared to other countries? I’ve worked at both big and small companies and my impression is that people around my age seem rather closeted, drawing clear boundaries and prefer to keep things ‘professional’."
64572,"I strongly suspect I may have Asperger's Syndrome, does anyone know where I can get a diagnosis (preferably on the more affordable side)? Does UHC provide such services? But I'm also a bit worried cos I'm a govt scholarship holder, will getting diagnosed now affect my scholarship (e.g. they force me to break bond and pay money) or my future career?"
64571,"Regarding Prof Ben’s comment that having money and a car helps to attract girls, doesn’t it attract the wrong type of girls? Given that jobs nowadays are not guaranteed, if you lose your job, money and cars, the girl will simply leave you. Won’t it be better to stay single rather than settle for a girl who is going to leave you sooner or later anyway."
64570,"Posting to get a sensing of what nus students think of this. I'm a short girl, my friend is a tall girl (~1.8m). She always complains that being tall is a disadvantage for girls when dating. I said she could increase her options by considering those guys shorter than her, but she says she does do so and that it's the guys who won't date 'up' because of insecurity. Obviously I have no experience in the matter as I've never been shorter than a bf, but from some convos with friends, it seems like most guys are okay with dating a girl taller than them. What percentage of guys do you think are unwilling to date a taller girl?"
64569,"I'm usually a carefree kind of person, but I feel like I've been afflicted by some sort of inferiority complex, though I have no idea how it started.

Social media may have been part of the cause, as I've seen peers or friends of mine found their other half (some even getting marrried), found jobs, travelled around the world, living their lives to the fullest.

I on the other hand, could not even motivate myself to try any of those stuff (and would probably procrastinate)... and I feel that if I force myself to try those things, it'll feel off and I just don't feel like myself at all. I always feel like I'm just an empty husk with no rich experiences to share with other people. As such, I just could not sustain conversations with other people that do not have common interests. 

Seeing other people able to blabber small talks out like that makes me envious, as they are the type that leaves strong impression to other peers. While I just feel like I'm one of those background characters, the ones that people can be easily forgotten.

I also feel that I have an issue with my communication skills, partly from getting scarred from past interviews. The mere thoughts of having an interview is enough to trigger anxiety attacks. When common interview questions such as ""Tell me about a time where you faced a conflict and how you dealt with them"" are asked, I feel morally obliged to not come up with a fake scenario just to answer the question, but on the other hand, could not even recall any real scenarios to answer the question.

Other interview questions such as ""What are your strengths"" also leaves me stuttered for answers as I couldn't even identify what I'm good at. But when it comes to weakness, I can critique myself so hard that it feels like everyone else is more suitable for the job other than me. ""Why should they hire me, when other people out there are more deserving?"" is just one of the common thoughts when it comes to job searching. 

I've also feel that my learning speed has slowed down, as I've seen other people who started late eventually surpassed my skills easily, such a learning to play new games, learning new languages, etc.

While I've told my friends that I'm still searching for jobs, I'm actually procrastinating, always giving reasons such as ""Why should I follow others and rush to get a job that soon?"", but at the same time knowing that if I continue to think that further, I'll lose motivation in getting a job, and just become a cash sink for my parents, becoming a burden.

This self aggravating feeling comes and goes every so often, and I've always used escapism (games, sleep, social media) to forget about these feelings. Sometimes it feel that my mind is just rejecting ways to improve itself as well.

Sorry for the lack of coherence between paragraphs, I just wanted to get this out there, before I forgot this feeling, only to trigger again because of a small incident. Where has my thinking gone wrong, and what can I do to escape from this horrible cycle of self aggravation?

Tl;dr Inferiority complex person looking for advice to improve and move on."
64568,What happened to NUS Business Camp this year? Heard there was a lot of rules broken by the committee
64566,"Guys, try using the dating apps overseas. The response is much better compared to sg. Food for thought."
64565,"Any advice on how to approach a guy, someone you saw across the library and felt like getting to know him? I’m quite shy and scared of the embarrassment if he outright rejects me or says he’s taken. I do not normally first express my interest in someone but would like to try."
64562,"Re #64562 , the OP was the group leader for our project. First, let me describe the outcome. Out of 4 members in the group, we scored 3A- and 1A. Project contributed to 40% of the grade. So overall the project was well done, as seen from the results.

Next, many of you may ask, how effective are your methods in group work? To put this into perspective, 3 of us are either taking double major or double degree, including the OP of the other article. In other words, time is very tight. OP of that article may exaggerate a bit in her words, but we are all very punctual, and it was only once someone was late due to her carelessness, so everyone downed 20 as half a joke and also a reminder to be responsible to the group.

It was natural that OP was the group leader of our group as she has a very clear sense of direction, and there are no objections to that. There’s only one problem - OP brags too much about her bf during out discussions. She sometimes exaggerate too much, just like the character of our group overall."

64558,There is this beautiful lady who takes the same morning bus as me everyday. She looks so sweet and I just cant stop thinking of her. I have wrote a mini card for her but I cant find the courage to give it to her. My mind keeps persuading me that she will think that I am creepy if I suddenly approach her.

64557,At what age do you allow yourselves to be called uncle or auntie?
64556,"Have been seeing this girl for a few months, went to the movies, cafe hopping, hitting the gym etc basically doing things couples would generally do except for more intimate stuff. Since we had similar hobbies and values, my liking for her increased everytime i spent time with her and i could sensed that she really enjoyed hanging out with me. Hence i confessed on Sat and we had a htht about our rs status. Not sure if its due to her upbringing, as she is sheltered by her parents, she mentioned that she isnt sure if she likes me romantically as she doesn't know how its supposed to feel. Yup so... i dont know what to do next. Im stuck. 

p.s our convo didnt turned awks after the confession tho... she still treats me the same way as if nothing has happened so what does it even mean? Im confused."
64555,"I am a 26-year-old male CS graduate here to comment about Prof Ben's recommendation of using CMB for dating apps. I really don't understand why the odds are in our (male) favor as graduates. Here's my experience on CMB:

For the past 2 years, I have been improving my profile iteratively making it more sincere and trying to improve my profile pictures. And I have read every possible article out there on how to make my profile more attractive while doing so. I am not even picky, my swipe right percent is like 40-60% and I do that every single day. I get 1 match only every 3-4 months and most of them ignore my messages anyway.

I don't think CMB helps much for guys, graduate or not."
64551,"I am in NS now with a diploma in accountancy with Big 4 internship experience and a place in NUS. Should I study full-time in NUS or work full-time one of the Big 4s and take a part-time degree at SUSS? If I study part-time, I can be a senior by the time I graduate as opposed to just being a fresh graduate. Any opinions?"
64549,"Can I get some genuine advice here. I am looking for a temporary job, but the agency offers me contract job that is $7.50 or $8 per hour. If it too little considering the inflation and high living costs in Singapore? A few years back, temporary job was around $7-$8 also. Goods price has since risen significantly but not wages. Should I accept the offer. 

2. If $8 per hour job only require to work 3 to 4 times a week, while $7.50 per hr job, I can work 5 times a week, which one is better?

3.Is it okay to accept a job offer, continue interviewing for the others, then reject the initial if I found latter was a better choice? Anyone has done it before? Will the agency blacklist me?"
64546,"Recently, a guy has been expressing interest in me and we have went out together a few times. But the thing is, I didn't have romantic interest in him in the beginning. So I'm confused if (A) I'm liking him now because he likes me or (B) I really like him."

I'm a male, with bmi approximately 23.5 (so quite close to overweight side). My last 2.4 timing was 11.14. I'm always very envious of runners whose steps feel very light when they pass me. Meanwhile, I feel like Godzilla trudging through the city.

This body is hard to get you know?! It really works."
64528,"Posted something about my gf clubbing a few weeks ago and I guess I finally understood how people always say they still love their ex after a breakup. I guess priorities usually change for everyone as they grow older, after getting into different stages of life. But I guess the best I can do is to wish her all the best for her future. 

I'm always the one comforting friends after a breakup, telling them time will heal their wounds and to delete stuff related to their ex but damn! It's easier said than done. It's already the 3rd night and I still haven't got over this shit. It's so difficult to delete all those pictures and texts. And why the heck are chinese songs so relatable? What should i do???"
64526,"Are dating apps like CMB and even tinder effective in finding suitable long term matches? And also are the people on these apps desperate for a relationship (a bad thing)? To me if the opposite side is desperate, it’s an immediate red flag.

Additionally, what is the longest any couple who got together via these apps stayed together, based on the people around you? Because I can’t see how love at first sight works. Normally for myself, for feelings to develop, I need to get to know the person first for a few weeks at a minimum, no way I can tell from the start whether I’ll fall for them."
64525,"To those guys here who are desperately wanting to get a girlfriend, let me share with you my story. I currently have a boyfriend outside of university. He’s very mature, kind and understanding. Full of life experiences too. He’s twice my age.

So to those guys out there, don’t be hopeless, you still have a lot of time and many chances."
64524,"I’m a former officer from the army. Unlike many people here, I believe that military style of leadership is effective in civilian life, i.e. military top down leadership style enforces discipline often lacking in civilian life.

I have adopted some aspects of this leadership style on my men in the leadership positions I hold in university. For example, “xx seconds, timer carry on” is one of the most effective, i.e. it gets things done quickly and efficiently. I can get my men to trust my judgement, because my men always understand the rationale behind why I do things. This is what makes military leadership work in civilian life for me.

I hope people can bash less about the army, and try to learn more from their NS. After all, who are we to judge the army?"
64523,"TLDR: My best friend of 10 years might not think of me as his best friend as well. I'm jealous.

I knew him since sec 2, and since then we've always been good friends. However, recently I found out that he's sharing secrets, htht etc with someone else, and seemed to have no intention to share whatever he was talking about with me. I kinda felt a bit disappointed, jealous and betrayed when I found out about that because usually I'm the first person he'll share any secrets with. 

To clarify, he still treats me as an 10 years good friend. I'm just slightly upset that my position as bff might have been replaced. Just ranting. :/"

64520,"Having heard that NUS only provides 6 sessions for counselling, I am unsure if I should even try going for it as 6 sessions would be insufficient for me. Also, does anyone know if NUS records your mental health issues and if your future employer might find out whether you have mental health issues (even if you don't declare)? Is it necessary to declare any past mental health issues that one have in the employment form? I feel that I should seek counselling but I am afraid that it may affect my future employment. Should I even seek counselling since NUS only provides 6 sessions?"

64514,"If you're a girl and you're unsure of whether you have the ""princess syndrome"" that everyone is talking about... here are some things you can put on your checklist.



You think ""I'm the number 1 princess in the world""

You have rules to your boyfriend like ""You must notice that I changed my hair"", ""You must take a good look at me, all the way to my shoes"", or ""For every one word I say, reply with three""

You think that it's not like it's selfish or anything to want your boyfriend to believe from the bottom of their heart that you're adorable

You think ""I'm the number 1 princess in the world"" and want your boyfriend to always notice you

You think that keeping you waiting is out of the question

You think that whenever you feel like having dessert, you deserve it this very instant

You always want desserts like a shortcake with a strawberry on top, or some premium creamy egg pudding

You think you can make it on your own and anyone who ignores you will regret it later

You think ""I'm the number 1 princess in the world"" and want your boyfriend to always keep his eyes on you"

64509,"Hi #64476, OP of #64464 here. To me, I feel that the biggest issue about ""military culture"" is the mindset, less so about the material side of things. I agree with those who said that we deserve the shoes, t-shirts, shorts etc. that we earn from our 2 years of service. I myself do wear them occasionally (not necessarily to school).

Maybe I didn't go into enough details in my previous post about what I meant about ""army culture"". I think for me, one of the more specific examples of ""army culture"" that stood out was when the project director of the event (which I shall not name here) shouted ""ten, nine, eight, ..., three, two, one"" He was trying to get us to get to where we should be for that activity within the time limit. Of course he did display other signs of ""military leadership"", but there are just too many to name here.

Anyway, I really want to give a big thanks for all of you guys who replied with advice (and the jokes), it helped a lot :D"
64506,"Are there any introverts out there who were pressured by their parents and relatives to have a conventional hotel wedding that costs over $20k? People generally find it weird that I don't want a wedding at all. It seems that society expects couples to want a large-scale, overly expensive wedding and make a huge show to show off to relatives. 

Well, I absolutely hate the idea of being one of the stars of such a large scale social event, and having to socialize with so many unknown people. I also don't understand why there is a need to spend so much (almost an entire year's worth of savings!!! It could be better spent on my BTO loan and renovation, even for my future baby) on an event which is going to tire the couple really badly. After being the maid of honor for my best friend's wedding, I seriously doubt I would enjoy myself on my wedding day. Having to wake up at 3am to do 3 hours of hair and makeup for $800 is insane. Gatecrashing is bullshit. Asking my fiancee to spend thousands on crap like cakes and suckling pigs as offerings to my relatives (to show how much he loves me) is also unnecessary, because my mum died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest this year, and the amount of help and support my fiancee selflessly offered to my family is already more than sufficient proof of how much he loves me.

I'm so frustrated that my dad thinks of me as selfish for not wanting a huge wedding. I would very much prefer a simple restaurant meal with close relatives and friends, so that all my wedding guests wouldn't feel pressured to give me an angbao containing a minimum of $200 for each person. Plus, I could even have more meaningful conversations with my guests if they are mostly close relatives and friends.

I am so sick and tired of getting stressed out every time I am discussing wedding plans with my dad and relatives, because they keep imposing their ideals and expectations on me. And I need to make decisions that make THEM happy. I am tired of prioritizing others' happiness above my own. Discussions about my wedding plans almost always causes me to end up in tears due to stress. Why is it that when I prioritize my happiness, my dad calls me selfish? It's like I exist purely to make him happy at the expense of my own happiness. The worst thing is that when I cry over this issue, my dad will invariably chide me, saying I am for 'crying over nothing' and 'cry cry cry for what? no meaning!!!'... effectively invalidating my feelings and making me feel worse.  All my life, he has always scolded me for crying, with the exception of when I cried after my mum died. It makes me wonder if he is a narcissistic parent who thinks that his child should never show negative emotions in reaction to his parenting. 

I just want to call off the whole wedding and end my life so I don't have to worry about anything anymore. :( If anyone has been through a similar situation, I would appreciate it greatly if I could PM you to have a chat. Thanks for reading my rant."

I feel very upset and helpless at times cause I don’t think the rs will last if I get into it just for sake of it.. I would also feel very bad and selfish for leading the other person on."
