54998,"Listened to your words
Gave me courage to speak up
Got misunderstood

Perhaps it was me
Not really understanding
Your subtle signals

Was it too direct? 
I don't know. It's too sudden
I am bad at this

These days feel awful
Reminiscing memories
You were always there

I know I did wrong
Please give me another chance
I will be better"

54992,"Honestly I don't know if joining NUSAS is the right thing to do. I mean I'm genuinely interested in astronomy, I find the stars and galaxies intriguing. They are so pretty, so mesmerizing... But after going for a few field sessions, I realised that I started to get bored of what the Singapore night sky has to offer. I started to get bored and wondered if I've really found my true interest... I've signed up for Astrobash when I was still very enthusiastic about observing the universe through telescopes, especially in a dark site, and escaping from the city. But now I'm doubting myself... I've always envy those who are so passionate about things they love, why can't I find that something too? "

54985,"Man, in my entire Uni life I never expected to make the best friends I had in my final years. Just a shame some of them are graduating earlier just as I met them. I think part of the sadness kind of is because I never really had friends in Secondary school or JC, so I never got why people were so sad when it ended. So, it is kind of like my first time experiencing it, truly missing having the time to spend seminars together."

54978,"I am thinking of starting a group for students who are weak in programming, with the hope of creating an environment where we can learn from one another through sharing and helping each other. I notice that students who have trouble learning to code doesn't have much avenue in school to get help from (i might be wrong). 

Please let me know in the comments below:
1. Is there an existing group in school that does this?
2. Do you think such a student group would work?
3. What do you think the group should do? (Weekly/daily meetups with presentation, or just study together and do our own stuff, etc)
4. Any other suggestions

As for the stronger students, frankly this group would probably not benefit you as much as for the weaker students. But I believe in ""the best way to learn is by teaching others"". Would you still be willing to help your peers?"

54968,"After getting into my first relationship, my BFF and I gradually stopped talking to each other. It wasn’t over any one fight, but for multiple reasons. The major one being that I realised she could not be happy for me, even in the early phases of me simply dating him. She often made sceptical and disparaging remarks about my BF, and made me feel bad about my relationship with him, so I stopped sharing about my dating life with her in detail. I tried to keep her updated but she never seemed too interested or happy for me, so I stopped completely. I still made it a point to talk to her every now and then, gave her gifts for special occasions and asked her to hang out whenever I had time. She never really did the same (didn’t initiate convos with me, didn’t give me any gifts, never asked to hang out). Since it was (is) my first relationship I was pretty caught up in it for a while, so I ended up sharing my love life with other friends who weren’t negative like my BFF, and who instead helped me through tough and confusing times. 

Now that it’s been almost 2 years with my BF, things have settled down into routine and I’ve since realised I feel very lonely (without a BFF). When we stopped talking, she seemed to find another BFF in her uni mate so whenever I see her instastories now I feel abandoned. She has since mentioned to me in passing that us drifting apart was mainly because of her and her issues, not me. I told her it was ok, that we all have our own issues to deal with, and that I’d always be there for her still. She hasn’t 
 really made an effort to re-kindle our previously close friendship, though.

I feel really alone because I’ve realised that everyone else seems to have a BFF or a tight knit of friends they talk to daily or can depend on anytime, but I don’t have that. I have several circles of friends but they have their own lives and own BFFs too.

I just wonder how many girls out there are in the same position as me, having lost their bff, and only have their bf to depend on left. I want to have BFFs again but I don’t know how to get any. Sigh. "

54962,"Dear A,

You know I am rarely serious about stuff, but in this letter, every word I’ve written comes from my heart and with all my sincerity.

These few days I have been reflecting about all the stupid things I did, and how I ruined our closeness that we once had before.

Sorry for being overly pushy and assertive, especially what I said after you left the library, I know it made you feel very uncomfortable, and honestly im not sure why I even said that. You said to give us time, yet I was an idiot to repeatedly say those stuff. 

Sorry for posting our pics on Instagram even though you are clearly not comfortable with it. I should have respected your boundaries and comfort levels on so so many occasions.

I said to protect you and to make you happy, yet I am the cause of your insecurities and uneasiness. 

I just want to say I miss the times we spent together, it was fun to laugh with you and share your joy. 

I hope you can hear the song I prepared for you, or go for the trip we planned, or have late night nonsensical chats. 

I hope we can be close again. 

With tears, Z"

i might be attached now but i've never felt so alone before. i really thought that she'd be the first long-term friend i've had in a while, but i guess i'm the common denominator of doomed friendships. i'm sorry to everyone and i really, really thank those who take the trouble to be around or with me.

54948,"To #54931 : Once you are financially independent you could see how you could move out and live by yourself. 

I live with my mum who has hoarding tendencies but thankfully I put in enough effort in housekeeping such that things (plastic bags, containers, magazines etc) don't accumulate, despite her objections. This can get annoying sometimes when I have a lot of work and badly need my weekends to rest. 

However, my aunt, who lives by herself in another flat down the corridor is a different story. Her dining table has only a empty A4-size section for plates because the rest of the table is filled with stuff she thinks are useful. The rest of the house is a big mess. One toilet is filled up with boxes and stuff. 

After ten years of having to go to her house for my meals (because my mum wants to be a good sister and cook for her), I made it clear to everyone that I would not be going to her house for meals.

54946,"#54919 #54944 While what you have said is generally true that most employers don't care, I would just share 3 job interview experiences out of <10 in my entire life (yes I am lucky) that explicitly referenced my thesis. I was a statistics major.

1. right when I graduated quite some time back, I interviewed for a statistician position in the civil service, and one question was about the topic of my honours thesis. So I went about describing it in very vague terms at the start hoping to not scare them off with details, but someone within the interview panel probed for more technical details and the theory behind my thesis, and followed up with meaningful questions that was very relevant to my thesis. So yes not all interviews are filled with people who are totally uncaring about academia. They then told me that they were looking for people who are more competent in the theory aspect, while many of NUS statistics graduates are merely decent at model fitting and doing statistical tests.

2. Just 3 week ago, I went for a ""final-stage"" interview for data science position in a certain bank, after passing the typical initial interviews. Days before this interview, someone within the bank emailed me requesting for my masters research thesis, even though I have yet to official graduate from my masters. I replied telling him that the thesis was incomplete and that I have yet to officially submit it, but he told me it's fine and that the current draft will be alright. During this interview itself, we ended up spending 10-15 minutes talking about some blatant flaws within my thesis and the extra experiments I can carry out to strengthen my case. After this interview I checked the linkedin of this interviewer, turns out he has a PhD. I was almost feeling very worried because he was going to evaluate me based on my incomplete thesis, but turned out they offered me the position just days ago.

3. I also interviewed for a research assistant position within NUS. On the day of the interview itself, it was clear that he at least skimmed through my honours thesis, and knows what I am doing for my current masters thesis. He is on good terms with my thesis supervisor. 

While I acknowledge that it is perfectly normal for professors to skim through your research when interviewing you, my experience with the bank is clearly telling of the current trend these days, especially when you are interviewing for a tech/IT position. Many of your potential bosses are going to be PhDs, who are going to take an interest in the research you did. So it is best to give the thesis your best shot :)"
54945,"I still have a hard time to process this but here it goes: I was touched by a girl on the MRT. I was sitting and she was sleeping. Her head was leaning towards me and ended up touching my arms. I thought of waking her up but didn't. I let her. After several times of physical contacts, I decided that this can't be right - she can't be REALLY sleeping cause I can clearly see her legs are consciously moving and stayed crossed! At the time, I had two options, leave or stay. And this is my fault, I chose to stay at the seat cause I was just too lazy to stand (to be fair my train ride was very long ok) Then it got worse from there - she touched my arm with her hand and that can't be seen from others cause her hair blocked the view. That was the moment that I told myself ""ok, this is really happening wtf wtf"". Then the train arrived at Somerset station. She suddenly ""woke up"" and ran out of the train. Then, I was so relieved that it was over. I never got to see her face but she looked like a 20s girl with a not bad bod from behind. I don't know what makes her did that or maybe her face cmi after all. Anyway it got me wonder, how many guys kena this before? Is this normal???"

54922,"To the OP of #54903 , this means your mother gave birth to you at 41 years. Woah, she must have been a really strong woman during the first 14 years being your mother-- most women go through menopause naturally between 45 and 55 years, and their body goes through some discomfort e.g. hot flashes, sleep deprivation, greater risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. This is on top of all the responsibilities and body changes she faced as a new mother! 

** I'm not saying all these to discount your feelings about not getting along well with your mom-- I'm sure you do want to understand her better, and for her to understand you better as well. **

My point is, during your most vulnerable time of your life, she has tried her best to understand you, provide for you, and be her level best compassionate with you. As the roles reverse, I hope we as young adults (me included because I can relate to your issue) can try our very best to be humble with our parents. 

I mean, if we know how much time we have left with them, if we find out just how much time we have left with them being of decent health, perhaps we will find that some things are not worth arguing with our parents about. Yes, you may see things one way, and your parent another way about how ""things used to work in the past""...but I seriously doubt that being combative and contentious works well in our favour to have our parents be more open to seeing our perspective...

Audrey and Miguel have really great points. For me, while my parents are not users of social media, I try to share with them about some social media happenings..yep, even memes! I also confide in them about some things at work/school, and save up to treat them to meals/outings out sometimes. The point about avoiding certain subjects can be quite difficult-- as it was for me during my late teens/early 20s...because younger me held the ostentatious view that ""I'm more informed, so I'm right, and since I'm right, then you're wrong""... until I learned that it isn't really like that in life! 

One thing I realised about parents when their children are in their 20s (esp if you don't come from a moneyed background) is that-- they have insecurities about aging and/or growing old alone, and while they really want their children to come around, grow up quickly, and be independent adults, at the same time-- they want to protect their beloved babies the way they know how :-p

The fact that you're concerned about your rs with your mom shows that you care a lot about her :-) Pretty sure you'll work it out somehow. "

54920,"Dear #54920 and #54896

I didn't bother to read any of your entries, I stopped at ""suicide"".

I have a cousin who is recovering from his second battle with cancer and never once did he attempt suicide.

During his treatments, he continued to attend school, this is despite feeling like hell due to chemotherapy. He also frequently visits the children's cancer ward to talk to children, listens to their hopes and dreams, while being hooked to an IV himself. All of the nurses knew him as the most cheerful patient they worked with. He did all of this despite not knowing if the treatment was going to work, whether he would live to experience his next birthday. He continued to live life to the best that he can, and we all know that a massive spectre of uncertainty is haunting him every single second. 

He went through multiple surgeries to remove tumours, a copious amount of chemo, and a bone marrow transplant, which I don't have to tell you, is one of the most challenging procedures in medicine. He spent months in quarantine after the procedure. We could visit him but we would have to be separated by a glass wall. Despite all of that, every time I met him, he smiles and tells me ""it's life, if it were easy it wouldn't be worth it"". He has so much positivity, so much strength, despite being in circumstances that is orders of magnitude more pernicious and tragic than anything any physically healthy people will go through. 

Having cancer is both an emotional and physical challenge, especially being diagnosed in 20s, not in your 50s like everyone else does. He made a choice. He never once stopped fighting, and always took things one step at a time. All his doctors could tell him was ""try this, and try that"", none of them have a guaranteed solution to treat or cure him. But even when his dreams were on the line, he would always say to me ""who knows, they might invent a cure tomorrow.""

Here we have someone who loves life, who loves people, who is fighting to live just one more day in order to make lives better for others. On the other hand, we have people who are making foolish attempts to end their lives, despite being born in a first-world country, and having been given the chance to attend university. Life is unfair. The odd thing is the people to whom life has been most unfair to, are always the ones whose lives are most treasured. If you do not appreciate life, then just end it, you don't have to complain about how others have been unfair to you, nobody cares and nobody wants to know. You have been unfair to yourself, because you can't even do the one thing to your own life—protect it. 

If you are curious, yes, I am diminishing the challenges you are facing. Grow up. If you can be rational enough to write a coherent post on the internet, rational enough to decide to share your story, I'm sure you are smart enough to understand that you have a choice. If you choose to end up in a situation where you don't think it is absurd to commit suicide, then I don't think anyone deserves to hear about it. "

54913,"it's so frustrating when half an hour before the submission deadline and i realise that i have the outdated public key file because nothing was said when i downloaded it from ivle, and how screwed i was when i finally thought i was done but realised nooo there's more. SOMEONE ON THE FORUM POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S MORE. all these issues could've been addressed days before the deadline, sure, but nothing was said on the forums, nothing was addressed in lecture. nothing was said, nothing was done, and i can only concede, because why? i'm incompetent, that's why. i couldn't fix the issue in under 10 minutes, that's why. i didn't realise there was an updated file, that's why. why can't i be like the cs gods. why can't i just have their kind of experience. why does it have to be so hard starting out and just..not catching all of these. why does it take me so long to just fix something."

54910,"Everyone should stop asking or hoping that the professor would give ""exam tips"" or like ""what topics to focus on"". As much as I would also love it, if university is really about learning and understanding new stuff, shouldn't we all just learn all the topics, understand what is being taught and let the professor test whatever they want without having to give us ""exam tips"" or ""topics to focus more"". Then again, university isn't what it seems anymore. They say its a place for you to explore and learn things that we are interested in (academically) but yet we choose our modules on what we think is ""easy to score"" or ""no examinations"", and most of the time not what we might be interested in.

54905,"i have never felt so ashamed of my size until recently. i am slightly taller than the average girl and i am almost overweight. recently, i have a crush on this guy who is not only shorter than me but also lighter than me. i feel so embarrassed by my size especially when one of our friends commented that he looks younger and i look older when we walked side by side (while in fact it is the other way round). i am worried that he is put off by the fact that i am larger than him so i don't really dare to make any move towards him. i am also worried that if it were to work out, people will still talk about me being so much larger than the guy for the rest of my life... 

i simply wish for nothing but to shrink a few cm and perhaps lose around 5kg... "
54904,"I don't get why my friends hate on professors who do not give comprehensive lecture notes. Like, you're supposed to listen carefully during lecture and take down notes. We have a textbook too- go read it up. Don't be lazy. Don't expect to be spoonfed like in JC.

PS: i'm upset about this issue because I really enjoy that prof's lectures but my friends hate him just because of his slides?"
54903,"To the OP of #54903 , this means your mother gave birth to you at 41 years. Woah, she must have been a really strong woman during the first 14 years being your mother-- most women go through menopause naturally between 45 and 55 years, and their body goes through some discomfort e.g. hot flashes, sleep deprivation, greater risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. This is on top of all the responsibilities and body changes she faced as a new mother! 

** I'm not saying all these to discount your feelings about not getting along well with your mom-- I'm sure you do want to understand her better, and for her to understand you better as well. **

My point is, during your most vulnerable time of your life, she has tried her best to understand you, provide for you, and be her level best compassionate with you. As the roles reverse, I hope we as young adults (me included because I can relate to your issue) can try our very best to be humble with our parents. 

I mean, if we know how much time we have left with them, if we find out just how much time we have left with them being of decent health, perhaps we will find that some things are not worth arguing with our parents about. Yes, you may see things one way, and your parent another way about how ""things used to work in the past""...but I seriously doubt that being combative and contentious works well in our favour to have our parents be more open to seeing our perspective...

Audrey and Miguel have really great points. For me, while my parents are not users of social media, I try to share with them about some social media happenings..yep, even memes! I also confide in them about some things at work/school, and save up to treat them to meals/outings out sometimes. The point about avoiding certain subjects can be quite difficult-- as it was for me during my late teens/early 20s...because younger me held the ostentatious view that ""I'm more informed, so I'm right, and since I'm right, then you're wrong""... until I learned that it isn't really like that in life! 

One thing I realised about parents when their children are in their 20s (esp if you don't come from a moneyed background) is that-- they have insecurities about aging and/or growing old alone, and while they really want their children to come around, grow up quickly, and be independent adults, at the same time-- they want to protect their beloved babies the way they know how :-p

The fact that you're concerned about your rs with your mom shows that you care a lot about her :-) Pretty sure you'll work it out somehow. "
