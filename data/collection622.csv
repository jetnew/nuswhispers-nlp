62291,"Hi all, so with all the hype regarding the recent saga surrounding the issue of misconduct, I've decided to jump onto the bandwagon and just share my two cents worth on this issue.

First, it's reading week with finals just round the corner. So, guys, please be the good university students you're supposed to be (or at least everyone else thinks so) and start studying your entire semester's worth of course materials within these last few days. You don't want to find yourself in the position where you are sitting in the exam hall, staring at the question paper and feeling the sudden, irrepressible urge to peep at those around you (especially at those that may catch your eyes). You are liable for your own actions as adults.

Second, if/when caught, as (hopefully) mature adults, please accept the punishment meted out with dignity. Please don't start putting the blame onto the deanery or any other bodies that is/are responsible for investigating the event and meting out the appropriate punishments. While some may argue that the punishments are inadequate, there are those who would think otherwise. Honestly, it is just impossible to please everyone.

Third, please stop victim- and/or perp-shaming, saying that it's his/her fault that made you wanna peep or that they are trying to gain fame through shame. With all due respect, you could have avoided this if you had just done what you're supposed to do - be a good university student. 

So yeah, with that, I wish you all the best in the upcoming finals.

Cheers.

TDLR; Just don't cheat in every sense of the word. "

62273,"#62224 Hello SoC junior, I'm a current SoC female student. I find SoC generally a nice place to be, both the students and profs are quite nice. An easy way to make friends is through taking the same module, or doing projects with people. Once everyone starts writing code together there's always a lot to talk about. :)

The gender ratio is a bit skewed. You may become more noticeable as a girl, but just be yourself and hopefully people stop noticing after a while. It's possible to meet creepy and weird guys anywhere, not just SoC. But I think the guys here are quite diverse and you may find some good friends among them. So welcome and good luck :)"
62259,"With people starting to come out with ideas on how to strengthen the safety, I suggest that the best is also to be more aware of your surroundings. 

For example, when you when inside the cubicle, look your head up and down. Ensure that no one is flimming you through the cubicles’ gap. Check for any spy cam before leaving the cubicles. This takes won’t take minutes. 

Remain alert when she are showering, especially if you stays in hall. Do not close your eyes when showering. Similarly, ensure no phone is filming through the cubicles’ gap and from above. ????????????"
62255,"this is a bit of the shot in the dark, but why not try...
I plan to transfer out of NUS to a US university in my 3rd year. Does anyone have any advice about this or any experience? It'd help a lot and I really appreciate any advice I can get!
"
62251,"Hello everyone, I am a year 3 student (girl) in NUS. Just want to ask if anyone has ever been in a relationship with ITE girls/guys, and what are your opinions on being in such a relationship?

Will it be a difficult match because of differences in educational background? Or are there success stories around? I will love to hear some of your sharing."
62247,"For freshies, who are looking enter chemical engineering because it used to be AAA/A course. My advise is that past glory does not make future story. Please go and carefully evaluate what path does chemical engineering brings you. Most important is to follow your interest. "
62243,"I strongly believe NOC (NUS Overseas Colleges) is partial to Singaporean students. Is it true? I’ve heard stories of them rejecting people just because they don’t have a government bond or have been PRs for several years. NUS brands itself as a very diverse and inclusive institution but is one of its major programmes diverse and inclusive? I know that they think international students will just go away and find a job in the NOC country, but honestly I’ve heard more of Singaporeans doing that. Also, international students literally cannot apply to any NOC scholarship. I understand why several Government scholarships require you to be a citizen or a PR but these scholarships are administered by NUS, so why are international students not eligible? I feel NUS has done a good job of establishing a diverse and inclusive environment but NOC definitely needs to be a bit more transparent and accommodating!"
62239,"If nich is truly remorseful, this is the time for him to turn things around and give a public apology. With the public hounding him like this, I feel that he should just withdraw from NUS as a way of assuming responsibility for this tragic episode. I mean, his social life in school is basically doomed anyway right? So what is the point of staying on when 30000 over people are demanding for the school to reopen the case and kick him out?"
62234,"So many divided opinions on Monica's case and not a single one will be able to provide closure.

To those who have supported Monica since the start of the saga, it was admirable of you to stand up for the victimised. Those who spoke up for Nicholas, it was also worthwhile to let others see things from a different perspective. 

And to those condeming NUS, I think you should stop. NUS has reasons for adopting the 'two-strikes-and-out' approach. It is an educational teaching to always give second chances to individuals. So don't blame NUS for it. Yes, the punishment is inadequate, because there is no fine line drawn between each erroneous acts. 

If voyeurism constitutes immediate expulsion, does rape invite a death sentence? How about minor acts such as vandalism, does it lead to immediate expulsion too? The thing is, NUS could have had it easy, any mistakes (cheating in an assignment/exam, smoking in school premises, acts of vandalism, sexual assaults etc.) will just lead to immediate expulsion. Criminal acts will then be referred to the law. 

That would have solved today's problem. 
 
Attend the townhall on Thursday, raise your concerns and suggestions there, let your voice be heard. The ongoing debates are not going to help much in Monica's cause. Social media is just a platform to let us share and have our freedom of speech, I'm not stopping you, but chances of having relevant authorities and institutional bodies reading all our opinions on the matter is really limited. 

Regardless if you are a student in NUS, support and respect the institution, help the Board realise what went wrong in the disciplinary verdict and induce change on Thursday. Only then will there be closure, and better protection for students.

62229,"Everyone's so hung up on the NUS voyeur thing like it's gonna change their lives, constantly reporting, sharing and commenting but forgetting about things that are far worse such as world hunger, the homeless, HIV, global warming and the well-being of their parents and love ones."
62225,"Hello I'm a first year SoC student interested in either SEP at Berkeley or NOC Silicon Valley. Would I be able to do SEP in Yr 2 and NOC in Yr 3, or are they mutually exclusive?"

62223,"Some of us have been barking up the wrong tree. I believe that before we can even consider if a punishment is too ""harsh"" or ""lenient"", we must first of all consider whether the punishment for this and prior cases in NUS were on par with those outside NUS. Because if there is even no parity in the punishment, then it is meaningless to argue whether rehab or other measures are more effective or not. Then in parallel the NUS should (and have already) started reviewing their internal punishments, but this must be completely separate from the SPF (specifically to student's entitlements to loans and housing + candidature suspension or termination). So instead of going after NUS alone we should be campaigning for the SPF to review which cases go up to prosecution and which are not, and the SPF should not take into account whether this occured inside an institution with a BOD-level of jurisdiction or not. Unfortunately as with past precedences, any changes in punishments cannot be retroactively applied.

Lastly, the trolls calling her out for seeking public attention should stop their antics. If not for her, these things will continue to perpetuate and if this didn't get blown up none of us will be here calling for real action. If you want to go after people, go after those vigilantes in HWZ spreading all sorts of speculations. In fact the NUS BOD and SPF should consider going after all the people who have sent serious threats to both the victim and perpetrator."
62216,"I am a female engineer student from NUS and after hearing the monica saga, I have an engineering solution for you. Wont it be better if we just install gates with an access pass to female toilets in residential halls in NUS? Maybe slightly raise the rental fees of hall students for the maintenance. Prevention is better and quicker than raising awareness right? Look at SMRT, to prevent people jumping down onto tracks to commit suicide they erected barriers on all stations around Singapore to prevent such incidents"
62215,"NUS and the Police/AGC needs to change its systems but the punishment of the offender; especially NUS's, which is consistent based on past precedence (regardless of how inadequate I feel it is); should not change. 

Public opinion should influence rules for the future, but having public opinion decide specific individual cases sets a very bad precedent, and will signal to people in the future that if you don't like an outcome, bring it to social media, sensationalize it and create an uproar.

This time mass opinion is on the side of the victim, but many times mass opinion is on the side against the victim too. Public opinion can swing both ways, I hope people can be more wary of encouraging public opinion as a benchmark for punishment and sentencing of individual cases."
62212,"There is a company which publicly announced that they will stop accepting NUS students for internships till the guy is expelled.

NUS students, on the other hand, can only make petitions. Do something more - such as mass skipping of examinations. I believe NUS management will try to stop this from happening."
62205,"OP of #62205: You probably won’t want to listen to me, but I still want to advise you that your best course of action is to break up with your boyfriend. I have an ex who’s like him as well, except that he wants me to have sex with other guys and watch. In the end, I just have to break up with him because what he wants - he has other fetishes as well - is just something that I cannot give him, and sex may not be everything about a relationship, but it’s one big part of it.   

I don’t want to use the word “pervert” to describe these kind of people, but there are guys (or even girls) out there who just have very weird sexual fetishes, and they are only going to become more and more extreme in their “preferences”. If you cannot accept and satisfy them, they are very likely going to cheat on you anyway because they are going to try to find someone else to satisfy them. Your boyfriend is very likely one of these people, and it’s almost impossible to change them. You end up having to change yourself to suit his tastes, and you are very likely going to be unhappy in the long run. I’ve been through it myself. 

Please make the best choice for yourself, not for your boyfriend, or you are going to waste your time in a relationship that won’t work out for you in the end.  "
62202,"""Guys, maybe if you’re not a woman, you will not understand the humiliation, the feelings of being violated, of helplessness, and shame for something you did not even do, and the fear that ensues weeks, months afterwards."" 

So apparently, only women are able to feel that level of humiliation and be susceptible to feeling vulnerable. "
