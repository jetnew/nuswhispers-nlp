61688,"Nowadays when people ask me where I study, what I want to do in the future, what I am doing, I just act blur and dodge the questions. 

You know why? I used to discuss about different careers and their salary scales. Then some extras would say things like “if you want money then you shouldn’t do this job.” 

Bitch please? So you apply for jobs without knowing the salary ah? So I cannot discuss about salaries and career prospects of different jobs ah? And who told you money is the only reason why I am interested in this career? You very noble. You work with zero regard to salary. You go buy a beautiful bungalow without knowing the price ah? 

I also used to tell people my plans, like if I cannot get into job A, I would have job B as my 1st back up plan, job C as 2nd back up plan, etc. Then again some extras would comment negatively, “If B and C are your back up plans, then you shouldn’t join B and C. If you have no interest, please don’t join this industry.” 

Bitch please? So what you want me to join? So I cannot have a back up plan is it? So I can only have 1 career choice is it? I have only 1 bridge to walk is it? Can’t make it then how? You feed me ah?

This is like somebody says “if I can’t get into NTU REP then I will do Electrical Engineering in NUS as my 2nd choice”, then an extra asshole comments “if it’s your 2nd choice, then please don’t join electrical engineering.” Bitch please? 

Furthermore, who says I have no interest in B, C, D? If I have totally no interest in them they wouldn’t even be in my back up plan. If I have no interest then I wouldn’t even be having a hard time comparing pros and cons of each of them. 

Yeah so when people ask about my plans. I will just smile and say internally, “NOYB”.

61686,"I wondered sometimes late in the night that does students with better family background stands an overwhelming advantage over the others?

Having that extra wealth would mean more/better access to materials such as tutors/study materials at the start. Can that be the deciding factor between a good student and a top student?

Lads, its a no for me after yesterday night. Despite spending over half a billion on transfers past 3 years, Manchester City still cannot get into the semis of the UEFA Champions League. They were beaten by a team whose only signing this season was a Korean player called Foo-Kin-No-Wan.

Life is not about who starts off better, but rather who had the stronger finish in the end. Good luck all for the exams. Be the son/daughter that your parents would be proud of.

61685,"Hi, I'm an exchange student from the UK here for one year. 
When i first came to SG i expected people to be far more conservative than people in the UK and the west in general, mostly because of the differences between western and eastern culture. But the more i've been here, I've realise that people, at least where I stay, are far more liberal than I originally though, specifically when it comes to sex. 
In the UK fwb is almost unheard of, and cheating is also completely frowned upon, but over here, it seems to me than quite a large portion of people either had or have had a fwb at some. Why is this, is it because young people in SG have been controlled by overly conservative parents their entire life and just want to rebel when they go to University or what? 
Regarding the cheating, is it universally thought of as bad, or is there a more passive, nonchalant attitude towards it? If so, why?"
61682,"To add on to the OP of #61673:

I am from Btech, so take my answers with a pinch of salt, or not.

- watered down curriculum 

According to the SCALE website: 

""A module with module code TEExxxx is equivalent to the module EExxxx offered to the full-time students. Subject to the approval from SCALE and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, a student may select a full-time equivalent module in place of any TEExxxx module.""

(http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/school-of-continuing-and-lifelong-education/undergraduate-education/btech-engineering/bachelor-of-technology-electronics-engineering/)

Most mods are of TEE and are equivalent to the FT. equivalent. Yes, lecturers might offer some extra hints to the assignments, but structurally, the core of each mod is the same as FT. Anecdotally, I frequently see FT students who missed lectures in the day crash our lectures at night - the content is the same! Look, I've seen lumicast webcasts and close to 90% of the content is the same!

- Btech students have it easy because modules are graded easier

The biggest issues facing BTech students are actually of lack of time to complete assignments + do sufficient revision. 

Here's a typical schedule for BTech students:
8.30am - Wake up and head to work
5.30pm - Leave work for class
6 pm - Reach class, grabbing a subway sandwich along the way (wow it's been the 35th subway you've had this sem). Sit through a whole class on partial differential equations, electromagnetic wave theory, Maxwell equations etc (after a 8 hour work day no less)
9pm - Class ends! Phew, time to make the journey home
10 pm - Reach home and freshen up before going to bed

Repeat for 4 years, at least 3 times a week (including special terms for the first 4 semesters)

It's tough and hence explains the high attrition rate. Almost nobody puts in work day to day, and the bulk of the studying only happens a week prior to finals, where you're playing the catch-up game by then. Don't forget, every lecture is 2.5 hours densely packed with content, and we all know that attention span tapers off quickly after the second hour. Oh yes, tutorials after that too, sometimes past 9 pm. 

If btech mods were graded on the same rigour as FT students, honestly, most Btech students would find it hard to score/pass. FT students can revise with friends (almost impossible for BTech), go to the prof during office hours (sorry bruh at work), and generally have a nice supportive network to push each other higher. Most, if not all, BTech students are fighting this battle themselves, and apart from the occasional weekend study session (a week before the exam, no less), they're alone.

Knowledge in a field is quickly lost once you stop applying it. To those condemning BTech graduates for their supposedly 'lower quality' degree - try out a sample problem set from any of the mods you took in year 1. Can't do it? Think about what would happen when you start working for a year after your degree. Are the supposedly 'inferior quality' of the modules that much of an issue when you can't even recall what you studied?

While this does not give justification for the lower academic rigour of BTech, given that NUS is ranked so highly in the world, that's your high horse opinion that nobody gives a shit about. What's the alternative to BTech or a PT degree then? Working as a technician in a company earning about 2k a month with kids and a wife to feed (I know a few)? How about staying in the same role for years because you're stopped by your paper credentials?

TL:DR: 

To upgrade oneself is a necessity in this day and age, and BTech students are just trying to create opportunities for themselves to succeed. There's really no justification for being in a quaint little garden of the i-GrAdUaTeD-FrOm-NuS club trying to stonewall those who attempt to get in despite their trying circumstances.

But truly, who the hell cares what your opinion is? Yes, you studied hard in poly to get into FT, yeah you've got a CAP of 5.00. Not all btech students want to merely pass, and not all FT students get cap 5.00. There are exceptions to the norm everywhere, and this applies to Btech too.

We're all trying to carve our own niche in the world in our own unique way. Let's stop bringing each other down and being so salty.

61681,"I'm a S'porean guy, 32yo, 171cm tall, 68kg and am quite fit with 16% body fat. Girls rate my looks 7-8/10. I'm also busy struggling to start up a business at the moment.

I've been single for 5 years after my failed 7 years relationship. I can't seem to land a girl since then who will stay by my side, all of them just wants to have sex for a while then go.

Some of these girls have boyfriends or are about to get married and I only found out after having sex with them. I feel so guilty afterwards and it's also heartbreaking to find out that I was just a toy. Once in a while, they still text me to ask me if I want to hook up which I have politely declined.

Girls who are more of relationship material think I'm a playboy because I'm ""so charming"", and I never get to end well with them. One of them recently left after a couple of months of dating, because she thought she was not good enough for me.

I want a stable relationship and start a family, but is it true that some people on this earth will never get to experience a happy ending? I feel like I'm one of them and I feel like shit.

My friends tell me it's because of my face and body that make me look like a playboy.

61678,"Adding on to internship problems, potential com science interns please pay extra attention on the job scope. It's common that companies abuse interns to clear the shit work that full time developer  ""do not have time to do"". But that said at least make sure the tech/framework you will be picking up is useful to you down the road.

I entered a german MNC with a vague AF job scope, forced to learn SAPUI5 frontend framework. The framework is old, heavy and shitty when compared to React, Angular, Vue. Reusability is near zero if you're not working for them. Worst part is none of the team (devs that are getting 6.5k-9k/month) have working knowledge of the framework they expect me to pick up and ship the project. 

Development skills are 80% self taught, given time we can learn and pick up any tech stacks. But we need to be selective and choose the tech stacks that has the best ROI. In short, learn from my suffering and make sure you get a concrete job scope before accepting the internship offer.

P.s There will be ppl leaving comments such as ""just do it well. maybe they will offer you a job""

61673,"I have been reading the ""threads"" on this page, in particular #61673. 

I know his/her intentions probably meant well, and so do many others when they try to encourage those who might not have done as well academically. However, you all have become well... extremists in your own right.

If someone has not done well, it is incorrect to say that he will have no future, that he is a failure, that he is any less of a man (or girl) than a person who did better than him. However, there are some things we should be wary of.

Firstly, like it or not grades ARE A REFLECTION of how intelligent you are (academically), the ability to retain knowledge and to a certain extent how hard you studied. As mentioned by many of you, ""no one cares about your results or where you came from, only how much you can bring to the table"". However, grades are important to climbing the academic ladder, particularly when applying for courses in university. Getting into a good university (eg Imperial or Ivy League), top tier courses, or a government scholarship will require a good grade as a pre-requisite. To say that grades are not important in the future, would just be a lie and give students in their impressionable pre-teen and even JC students the false impression that ""I don't need to work hard since it doesn't matter in the long term"".

Secondly, we never ever put down the people who have done well, or downplay any of their achievements. Many people (including the OP who keeps discussing the BTech thing) seem to have the idea that grades are not important, that nobody cares in the future workforce. While this may be true in hindsight, it is not right to discourage or mock those who have done well, telling them that no one cares about their results. After all, most of them worked hard for their grades, so shouldn't we celebrate their achievements with them?

Lastly, just cause a few of us are ""arrogant"" and think of people who did not do as well as inferior, does not mean that all of us fall into that same category. How would you like it if I said all the people in low-demand courses ""lazy"" or ""stupid"". You wouldn't like it, just like how the people in better courses don't want to be universally classified under the arrogant category. 

To those not doing well academically, this is not directed at you. As long as we all achieve our maximum potential and feel happy about what we are doing, that is what really matters. To those who keep putting across the point that results do no matter (or along those lines), stop it. Your originally good intentions have turned extreme to the point where engaging in ""elite-lynching"" have become the norm of society today. 

P.S I noticed people on this page like to correct grammar when they cannot debate a point (or resort to some obscure line of mockery) so let me point out that in the last sentence, ""have"" should be ""has"".

61657,"Responding to: #61657. I think your argument and post is extremely problematic and counter-productive in improving the quality and support of local television. Yes, a large portion of the demographic captured by Mediacorp is comprised of members of the pioneer generation - but that's exactly and only because they're the captive market. Mediacorp has no competition for the viewer who has no access to cable television, or the knowledge or will to use the internet. Given the option of better programming, I have little doubt that older generations would also make the switch.

While you might be correct that there exist, at least in theory, a positive effect that might result from the covert PSAs littered in the storyline of local TV, you should also keep in mind (a) that it's exactly these PSAs that appear to turn off so many others from watching (if you care any at all about viewership from other demographics). (b) There is also equal opportunity for local tv to be used by corporate entities for covert advertising (read: unethical product placement). (c) It is doubtful that these efforts have any impact in encouraging cross-generational dialogue any way- the shows themselves certainly won't serve as a common topic if nobody under the age of 30 has ever watched them. And (d) there is a question about how accurate is their depiction of Singaporean worries and troubles if they only ever deal with these questions with the bureaucratically sanctioned sanitised kiddy gloves that appear to be issued with every show. 

The truth is that Mediacorp is losing viewers and will continue to lose viewers regardless of how people talk about it. Even the younger generations that you cite as once watching okto and kids central, now have smartphones and are internet-savvy enough to utilise YouTube. The solution to bring them back shouldn't be to remove their phones (though I think removing their phones is a good idea) and strapping them to a chair facing an okto original- it should be to improve programming to speak to the cultural and Singaporean-specific problems and worries that the youth have. If you want to support any product (local or not), your task shouldn't be to convince people to buy it regardless of its quality, it should be to support the improvement of the product so that it can stand on its own merits. And if the only people who watch it, are the people who have nothing else to watch, then it simply isn't very good.

Good art serves a purpose in society. It creates a shared national identity that transcends economic, racial, and generational differences; it serves as catharsis for the anxieties that are unique to the Singaporean experience. There's so much more that local television can be, and we do disservice to the industry if we say that we should support it regardless of what it's currently like. If you want to support the local tv industry, then demand more from the company, not the consumer."

61633,"Just needed a place to get this out of my head. 

Let me first state the obvious; 
Money means everything. 

It not only has the ability to give you immediate material satisfaction, but also gives second, third and fourth chances in life. Didn't study hard in O Levels? Its fine, just go overseas to an easier education system, compete among the weaker students. Messed up your A Levels real bad and can't make it into a course you desire in a Singapore University? Just go overseas to a less competitive one, and come back maybe several years later.

How can you say overseas students are any less intelligent than local students (pre A-levels) some of you may comment. Lets be realistic here. The education system in Singapore is analogous to a sieve, with each major exam being a filter. At the PSLE, all students competed against one another. When it comes down to the A Levels, the strongest of us remain, fighting for those few places in the courses we wish to pursue. Most of the students flying overseas are those caught in the sieve.

Is the purpose of the post to criticise the education system? Ironically enough, it isn't. While most people like to poke at the system, saying it is ""elitist"" and ""unnecessary stress"", it cannot be denied that when entering ANY university, grades are the easiest, most tangible method of ranking us.

I am not talking about students who go to Cambridge, Imperial or those top grade universities. I do not criticise the students who took less completive courses overseas because there is some truth to wanting to see the world in your youth. I am not talking about scholars as they earned their places. I speak against those who took the easy way out, could afford to fly to an unknown, less competitive university, pursue the course they desire, and then fly back, with the smirk satisfaction that they have achieved their dream career. You however, are no better than me, and definitely should not think of coming back to Singapore. Your foreign degree should not be recognised in Singapore when trying to get work as you are a heck lot dumber than our students.

Yes, I am salty as heck. But if I cannot buy the chances you all were given, at least let me having the privilege of ranting for free."

Good for you, you've completed the Assignment 3. As someone who is dying from that assignment for weeks (and it's due tmr wth), I think you're being rather unhelpful. Of course I don't condone sharing the flag directly, but if fellow students are asking for help, at least give them some direction rather than tell them the flag entirely, give them clues in what concepts to think about to approach the questions. Cos the hints given out are not even substantial, it's really difficult to understand what concepts we're supposed to apply.

On the side note, I'm kinda surprised people are complaining more about CS2030 than CS2107 assignments. The latter is terribly awful."
61628,"Reading the whole saga about the FWB guy supposedly knocking up the girl and now debating who should take responsibility for what, it left a very sour taste in my mouth. 

You wanna know what's worse than that? Going abroad to study, thinking you'd be in a LDR with your GF back in Singapore for those three years and then come back to her. Only to get a message halfway into Freshers' Week when you're overseas settling into life there from your girlfriend telling you she's breaking up with you out of guilt... because apparently despite only being together three months earlier, despite her losing her virginity to you only two weeks before you flew off, and always using protection thereafter, she tells you that she somehow found out she was pregnant and that she's already gotten a chemical pill abortion without even telling you anything beforehand. 

Then drop everything you were doing there and buy air tickets to fly back to try and see her and salvage anything possible. Not even knowing if she was lying about the pregnancy because so much didn't seem right about her story, or if it was really true and you just lost your first child that you'd have gladly taken responsibility for. And the final kicker? Arrive back in Singapore, but never get to see her again because she freaked out about you actually being serious enough to fly back to look her up again, and getting her mother to turn you away and leave things irrevocably broken. 

Bonus part of this story: one year later you return to Singapore for summer holidays and somehow manage to meet up with your ex's close friend. And then you hear from her that your ex was never pregnant. That she made that whole story up because she feared that I would be attracted by Western girls overseas, and in her fear of being cheated on she decided to break things off first but somehow couldn't do so directly. Hence the cooking up of the fake pregnancy and abortion story, because somehow in society the stereotype is of guys knocking girls up but running away at the first opportunity to shirk their share of responsibility. Not expecting you to actually NOT be one of those stereotypical guys, not expecting you to fly back halfway around the world for her, not expecting that you were actually serious about keeping the relationship and possibly even the baby if it were a real thing. 

Yeah, this is the story of my life. This is a major reason why I'm so scarred when it comes to relationship and love. And to that confessor who actually dared to comment about how much money he spent on condoms in that confession, I really spit on you for being such a disgrace to us men, for your absolute lack in placing priority on the right things, and for your petty complaint and whining.

61626,With reference to #61626 I am Indian man married to Chinese lady and have 3 daughters. I tell them not to marry a Indian man in future based on my observation I think negatively of my own race men. 
61624,"#61624 I had some pain in my scrotal area maybe 5 years back, assumed it to be some UTI (since I wasn't sexually active yet) and went to the doctor to get it checked. For some reason he decided to do a sperm count and other investigations, tests came back with the diagnosis of prostatitis and positive for antisperm antibodies.

Sterile since then. It's been a few years, I can't remember what he was saying anymore, all I remember is basically that he told me it's practically impossible for me to have kids.

Kinda sucks, but I'm planning on adopting anyway even if I don't get married.

61622,What's the difference between Malaysian girls and Singaporean girls? None. Both run away when I ask them out
61615,What can one do with a math degree besides teaching? And what's a good 2nd major/minor to complement it? 
61614,"#61533: you should be alerting the prof instead of posting a rant here lmao. I'm guessing you don't want to call out ppl that you know? In that case, no choice, suck thumb lol "
61611,University of Toronto has been awesome to me. I am going to get such bad post-exchange withdrawal when I come back... I literally live next door to my labs and lecture halls. I can wake up at 8:30 AM and not be late. People do my laundry for me and I have every meal prepared by students reading hotel management and hospitality. Ahhhhhhh! I don't wanna go back!
61610,"hi #61610 i'm writing this assuming that you're the father of that fetus

when you guys agreed to be in a free-from-responsibility relationship, was pregnancy in the picture? did she explicitly agree that if she got knocked up you will be FREE from ANY responsibility?? she asked you to take FULL RESPONSIBILITY and you're saying she's not shouldering any responsibility at all? don't be dumb she will be the one carrying the baby, going through the painful birth AND take care of the baby for life. if you run away like a coward she will face the stigma of being a single mum and YOUR CHILD will not have a dad. not shouldering any responsibility you say..?  

were you forced to fork out money for the condoms? obv not, you were probably excited to be using it when you bought them. do you want to claim ignorance that condoms are not 100% effective? 

the blame is on both of you. y'all made the decision to be in fwb so take responsibility of the consequences of your decisions. don't play the victim card by claiming fReE fRoM rEsPoNsIbIlItY.

anyway i hope you actually become a better person since you're a dad-to-be. all the best and stop arguing about who should be blamed and step up like a human being."
61609,To the guy who did the slides for all the CS2040 lab sessions. Thanks for the Monster Hunter pics and Jojo references. It made revisiting slides to revise some coding concepts much more bearable and less dry.
61606,"To OP #61606 , I agree with your last sentence that Malaysian girls are conservative when compared to Singapore girls. I've dated both and the difference is quite apparent especially when you consider sex before marriage. For Msian girls that I've dated, most of them hold true to the traditional belief of abstinence from sex until marriage while Spore girls I've gone with have a more ""Western"" mentality and are more open about sex before marriage and ONS. I hope I didn't come across as stereotyping as I'm speaking from my own experience. Feel free to disagree or even share your own experience if you have dated both."
61600,"Hello all, just wanna get this off my chest. I'm just feeling pretty dejected as everyone close to me is either getting married soon or happily in a relationship. I know it isn't the time for me yet but the wait is torturous.

Just makes it kind of lonely when you have things that you want to do with someone else but you can't. I'm a decent person too, just wondering why is it so hard to meet someone decent too, that's all.

Goodnight~"
