56398,What's the difference of A+ and A when they carry the same grade point? What percentage is given to each? Thanks. 
56397,"Please, does anyone had any experience with taking a module without having fulfilled the pre-requisite yet? Such as taking both modules in the same semester. I believe it should be possible but need some confirmation and advice on how I can make it happen. Who should I contact to discuss my module plans for upcoming semesters? It is urgent and any help is appreciated."

56388,"As an average CS student, how do I stop wanting to get first class and instead know my place?"
56386,"Just want to get this off my chest, although advice is welcome-- I have no idea how to make friends. I half-jokingly wish there is a UE that teaches it. Before anyone jumps to any conclusions, I'm not a guy from CS, I'm a girl from FASS lol. 

I can function as a good project member, but I can't make friends. I have tried initiating conversation outside of project-related discussion, but that often tends to burn me. The conversation gets shut down, I get one-word replies, or I just straight-up get ignored. I would be the one asking all the questions, showing all the interest, etc, but it's never two-way. Maybe the words I choose are highly offputting and/or creepy? I'm not sure because no one has ever told me. 

I've joined three ccas, and attend events both on-campus and off-campus. For ccas, I end up treating it as a work environment where I just submit the required projects. I enjoy the ccas and the events regardless of my inability to make friends, but it would be nice to have some. 

Sometimes, it is because my hobbies don't align with the hobbies of people in the given social circle, like within a given cca. Other times, I just don't see what there is to share about. I might be playing a video game, or designing a poster, but see nothing to say about it. Even when I have something to share, like if I've read a good book and want to talk about it, most likely the other person hasn't read it. And they sure as hell aren't going to read a whole book just for me, lol.

I'm sure that it is certainly more to do with my flaws as a person, and less to do with others' ability to ""get"" me. To suggest that my hobbies are just too obscure for others to click with me, is pretentious and ultimately false. However, as for what flaws I actually hold as a person, I don't know and would love to know. Self-reflection is hard, yo.  

I also don't have a bf or gf, but that doesn't bother me as much. I hear about guys who straight-up confess to girls they've barely spoken to in the whole semester, stories about girls with like ten ex-boyfriends, etc, and all those stories blow my mind. How do such things even happen? "
56385,Does anyone know if dean's list takes into consideration of your SAP before SU or after SU? And whether the A+ and A make any differences. 
56382,"Hi NUSWhisperers,

56380,"I am from pharmacy major and I have lost interest in pharmacy.

Imagine studying for 3 years worth of therapeutics and self care, and yet still deemed not competent enough still. Whats the point of studying those modules during the undergrad if the knowledge is not enough? Maybe patient care is not my thing. We may find jobs in the pharm industries. However, the pharmacy degree is a ""Jack of all trades, master of none kind"" of degree (if you minus away the clinical modules which is less than half the curriculum what even). We are inferior to chemical engineering people, chemistry majors and even business majors in the industry in terms of skills and everything. 

The job market for pharmacists is already extremely saturated. Hospitals are not hiring any non-scholars. Do not be fooled by the graduate employment survey. I regretted not taking up a healthcare scholarship to lock down a job. All i could do now is to pray hard that i could even secure a job after graduation.

56375,"OP of #56375 here,

@ Ck Fong
Appreciate your well-intentioned (?) advice, I agree with you on the cheatsheet part, but perhaps I should have provided clearer context in my efforts to protect my anonymity. AFAIK, there are only 2 modules with cheatsheets in the entity of the course. And those modules require more applied response so rigorous information would barely useful anyway. So what about the bulk of the other modules? Also, not everything is MCQ, and MCQs can be extremely tricky if they play with 1 or 2 words you have to specifically memorise to not get tricked. Not forgetting the exam conditions when time is tight and every option seems to be the correct answer. Yes, I agree with your second paragraph, but these questions are minimal and don't forget they still require memory work for concepts across different topics. As for your last statement, sorry to burst your bubble, but not everything can be ""studied smart"". Try memorising chemical structures, biological names, numbers that have no particular pattern all at once.

@ S P Ong
It's not as simple as that. Please don't misquote me, I didn't mention ""just memory work"". Memory work is far from ""just"" and is extremely intensive if it is expected for every single question. It also defeats the purpose of setting an applied question because whether you have a chance to approach that applied question is conditional on whether you first memorised that detail. Not really sure what you're driving at by bringing in your educator experience. Are you sure your class is not simply overwhelmed by the contents in your second mid-terms? (Open-book is one thing, being reasonable about it is another) This may be my own postulation, are you sure you didn't increase the amount of content because it is open-book? But from an educator's mouth, I am astonished by your condescending tone towards struggling students. ""Only losers whine about this kind of thing"". Wow okay, way to go, social justice warrior! I have a better advice for you, if you can't take ranting, don't follow NUSWhispers.

@Prof Ben Leong
You never know, eyes everywhere. ;) Nevertheless thank you for your input, it made more meaningful sense without that tinge of condescension in the former. I largely agree with them, although I am still against the idea of using the stick approach on university students since we are expected to be independent adults. That being the adopting of cheatsheets in place of open-book tests to ""force the students to consolidate and summarise what they have learnt"". Maybe I haven't clearly stated it, but I am not against the idea of cheatsheet examinations. I barely even have them! Or maybe I'm being unappreciative of the mere two cheatsheet exams I have, but welps.

@Henry Goh
Couldn't agree with you more! ""While it is good to know a lot and be able to come up with theories and processes that are textbook based, it doesn't train students for the workforce. Applications of knowledge is where the value add is, not regurgitation."""

Apart from general usage, I will be using the laptop for schoolwork, programming, watching webcasts (lol), but not for gaming. I don't intend to buy a separate desktop for home, and I don't mind carrying a heavier laptop to school, so I'm thinking of getting ~14 inch screen. I'm looking at laptops around $1000 to $1300 -ish.

Some questions: 
- Should I buy now, or wait for IT fair, or buy on Amazon/another e-commerce website? 
- Should I go for an i5 or i7 processor? (Is the i7 processor worth its price, or should I just get a better i5 processor?). Should I go for dual or quad core?
- Actually, which specifications/ details should I pay attention to?   
- Any laptop recommendations?

56351,"#56306 Not at all! From my experience in my current faculty, 3K and 4K were MUCH easier to score in than 1,2Ks. At least for me. I had teammates in my 4K module that scored a B or a B- in their foundation modules (1K stuff) but did really well in the project! This happens for a few reasons - first, 3K and 4K mods tend to have smaller classes and some of them don't even have a bell curve. Also, you are more likely to excel in a more 'nicher' specialisation or field that you really enjoy, which is what higher level modules cover. I was on the fence of 2nd lower and 2nd upper the first two years, but my grades went up in the last two. So don't be scared and hope you enjoy your higher level mods!!! "

My CAP can’t go above 4.0 anyway. Despite my lazing right before exams, my results turned out better than expected (B+/A-). I know it’s not anything great to the many smart people here but considering that I barely revised, couldn’t do at least 50% of the papers and my peers all know how to do the exams, I thought I would have fared much worse. I seriously thought I was going to fail the module that I scored a B- for since I could barely do the paper at all and it’s worth 70%. Now I can’t help but wonder how I got such grades, better than those peers I spoke of. My mom suggested that maybe the university doesn’t actually mark all the papers but selectively (or randomly) issue grades.

56345,"To the (i’m assuming) pharmacy students of #56285 and #56287, I was in the same position as you, except I was from archi.

Everyone seems less stressed,  do less but scored well. I felt that it was unfair, but looking back and reflecting, I hated my work, hated archi, and it translate to my work being subpar.

I didn’t even know what I was doing in archi, other than the fact that my parents thought it was all so good and prestigious. The first half of the course I was struggling so hard. My cap was below 3.0, which couldn’t be helped because I keep getting C+ or C for our core mod of 8mc, (only got a B- once).

In the later half of the course, when we had time for UEs and the option to drop our core mod, I explored and found mods that I actually really enjoy studying. I didn’t even need long hours or overnighting to study because I really liked it. 

Thanks to that, I managed to pull up my cap from a pass to a third lower, and I was really really happy. You don’t need a first class to be happy, everyone has their own goals! You can only be happy if you stop comparing.

After going to summer school and taking UEs to explore my interest, I’m out of archi and doing something I actually like in a different industry. 

Don’t worry so much right now! There are a lot of people in similar situations. I had a cousin do a career switch in his 30s and there were also policies that can subsidise your learning in another field. WSQ or something. Keep pressing on! "

 By the way, have you sought help from the TA's and lecturers? Most of them are actually helpful and approachable if you’re willing to take the initiative to seek for their help. If you’re too shy to interrupt the class with your *low-level questions* (most likely they’re not), stay back after class/ walk-in for a consultation session with your lecturer/TA.

Of course, don’t expect them to spoon-feed you have the answers by not preparing for consultations. The BARE-MINIMUM is to copy down the tutorial/solutions and annotate what you don’t understand. After understanding, re-do the question to test your understanding.

BTW, are you from engineering? I will share with you what I did to survive.

Lectures:
-Print out hard copy beforehand, take a quick 5-minute glimpse of the contents so that you won’t go into the LT w/o knowing what’s going on.
-Most lecturers will speed through the contents, (you can’t really blame them as they have to finish the syllabus on time and cater the speed to the “majority”). Don’t feel despair if you can’t catch up with the pace. While there may be a handful of fast-learners in the LT, most students can’t fully absorb as well. 
-Just circle/annotate what you don’t understand. Don’t ask around your neighbors when lecturer is teaching. They may not be able to give a truly correct answer and it just irks everyone in the LT when there’s an ongoing commotion.
-At the end of the lecture, you can either “chiong” to be the first to ask your annotated questions/ wait for everyone to finish asking (they could be asking similar qns, so you can those off).

Tutorials:
-For Engineering, we usually have 5-7 tutorial questions. Unlike in JC where you can just “refer to lecture notes” for a similar example, NUS tutorial questions really requires you to crack your brains (at least for the first attempt). While some lecturers may disagree with this, I find it rather futile to waste over 1 hour thinking how to solve every single tutorial question.
-During tutorial, pay attention and jot down all the “solutions” from the white board. Heck if you don’t understand and cannot catch up, copy them down first! You can proceed to clarify your doubts at the end of the tutorial.
-Go home and redo the tutorial by yourself. Make sure you’re not blindly just copying your solutions to another piece of foolscap. Still unable to understand after redoing the tutorial? Go arrange a consultation session with your TA/ lecturer.
-Don’t procrastinate. If this is a week 3 tutorial, make sure you can redo the same tutorial by yourself (without aid) by the Saturday of week 3. If all else fails, return to the TA/lecturer again on week 4 ASAP. My point is, don’t accumulate your doubts. Trust me, the snowball effect is insane as you realize you can’t understand anything if your foundation is not built properly.

Labs:
-I’ve seen some students went to the extent of videoing the lab briefing haha. But IMO, it’s too tiring to waste my time “re-watching” a video tape. If you difficulties catching up/ understanding, I suggest that you can try “crashing” other lab sessions for a better understanding (Idk if this is still legal anymore). TBH, most GA/TA won’t even know if you’re crashing when you’re a “regular face” in their lab sessions.
-Max out all the lab participation marks by double checking your answers with the GAs.
Exams:
-Past year papers: Except for large cohort general modules such as MA1505 and MA1506, you’ll realize that most PYP don’t come with solutions. So I’d rather make sure a solid foundation is set via the tutorials first. Occasionally, the lecturers may release 1-2 recent papers with solutions. Focus on those and check with the lecturer if the older papers are still part of the syllabus.
I still find this advice by my JC teacher relevant for most NUS exams.
~50-60% of the questions: As long as you’re able to redo the tutorials by yourself, you should have no issues getting full marks (unless careless mistake).
~20% of the questions: Indirect questions, with more thinking and analysis, you should be able to do them (understanding the concepts).
~10-20%: Crazy questions (Tests you’re true mastery of the subject). Don’t be surprised if it is close to never mentioned before in the entire module. These questions are meant to differentiate between A/A+.
-So attaining at least a B/B- wouldn’t be too difficult if you can do 60% of the questions.

Friends:
Although I joined two orientation camps prior to year 1, the people whom i mixed with were not from camps  (Different tutorial groups etc.) Rather, through asking questions after class/ lecturer I’ve gotten to know few like-minded people. While NUS is known for its notorious cutthroat environment, there are still plenty of people who are willing to collaborate and help each other. Some may be weaker/stronger than you, but why not let's work together and score 100% for all our graded class assignments together? (Even the smartest students could make careless mistakes in graded homework btw). Of course, what’s better than being able to work in a group of like-minded hardworking people for your projects? 

Along your journey university you’ll encounters all sorts of people including, back-stabbers stealing other people’s code in lab, sabotage, buying senior’s code, all sorts of unethical stuff to survive in this competitive environment. But there’ll be no pride and reputation in those people’s work. Most likely they’re gonna be perpetuate with such corrupted mindset at work in future.

At the end of the day, you’re responsible for your own grades and learning. Whenever you’ve a setback, ask yourself “have I tried my best?” If yes, give yourself a pat on the back and continue sourcing for new solutions. That’s the point of university education right ? :)

Scored a couple of As, A-s even 2 A+s over the years!! so the rumour about falling CAP as 2ks and 3ks are harder is not true at all. I did so much better for 3ks modules. So don't give up! Just study hard and do your best each sem and you will definitely improve. Fighting! "
56310,"Hi seniors who’ve been on exchange! I understand that there’s already some coverage from NUS Student Travel Insurance policy, but was thinking if we should get an additional annual travel insurance plan of our own, especially if we’re going to be travelling a lot during the exchange itself. I’ll be going to the UK if that matters.

Any replies would be greatly appreciated! :)"
56307,"Students tend to praise the S/U system as a win-win, and there's some mods I feel like S/U-ing too. However, I'm afraid rendering S-grades will look bad on my academic transcript when it comes to employment. 

Won't employers raise their eyebrows if they see someone with decent CAP but with many module grades that have S on it? Then when compared to someone with a clean academic transcript free of S grades, but a slightly lower CAP...who would get the job? (all other factors ignored of course...)

Anyone currently working mind sharing some insight? Do employers see graduates with S grades as suspicious or anything? "
56306,"#56306 Not at all! From my experience in my current faculty, 3K and 4K were MUCH easier to score in than 1,2Ks. At least for me. I had teammates in my 4K module that scored a B or a B- in their foundation modules (1K stuff) but did really well in the project! This happens for a few reasons - first, 3K and 4K mods tend to have smaller classes and some of them don't even have a bell curve. Also, you are more likely to excel in a more 'nicher' specialisation or field that you really enjoy, which is what higher level modules cover. I was on the fence of 2nd lower and 2nd upper the first two years, but my grades went up in the last two. So don't be scared and hope you enjoy your higher level mods!!! "
56304,Hi there URGENT is there anyone going to Trinity College Dublin/any uni in Ireland for exchange next academic year sem 2? If there's even one more person please let me know of your existence so my Dad will let me go T^T 
56303,"hi guys, i'm a y3 student and i'm a psychology major. i was wondering if you can do honours thesis in y3s2 and graduate early in y4s1? sorry i'm not really sure how early graduation works."
56302,"Is it true that FASS students can only take CS1010S, or can they take other equivalents?"
56301,"Hi readers,

legit question here but what are your own personal cap goals at the end of the 4 years? Especially  seniors who have been through at least 2 semesters already. 

Would you be satisfied with a 2nd Upper? Or do you still strive for first class and for what purpose?
At what point would you decide first class is no longer attainable or that it is too hard to maintain? 

Perhaps the answer would be different across majors also as the highest distinction may matter more in some cases? 

Thanks!"
