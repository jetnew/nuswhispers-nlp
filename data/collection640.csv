64099,Incoming freshmen this year. Conflicted as Im not sure if I should stay in hall...don't want to miss out on uni life but also the financial cost of staying hall is rather high for me..
64098,"There was this lady who told me to keep quiet at PC Commons but the problem is i was whispering. I was very apologetic but i dont think she have to shout so loudly when i only whispered a few words. When she left her seat for more than half an hour, i decided to write her a “love letter”, to confess to her about her leaving the seat and choping it for more than. 30 mins, not one seat but two. Results in depriving study spaces for students. Is quite ironic huh? I thought i was inconsiderate but realised she was way inconsiderate."
64097,"Hi #64097, I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with your part-time Master programme. Perhaps you can share which department the programme is under, so that people can give you some advice on how to improve? You are 2 to 3 semesters away from graduation, more than sufficient to pull your CAP up to even more than 3.5, if that's what you're aiming for. At worst, your current effort would still guarantee a graduation anyway. 

Like yourself, I've done a part-time Master programme in NUS while doing a full-time job. I also had several years of gap between it and Bachelor days so I couldn't figure out how to prepare for the exams and ended screwing up my first semester, getting a B- and B while my peers were all getting at least A-. My next 3 semesters were much better as I started revising 1 month ahead instead of 1-2 weeks ahead of exams. I also didn't had to sacrifice much of my of my social life and could watch TV too. I felt less stress too? Maybe because I did Engineering, which is probably not as difficult as what you're as what you're studying now, but after I became less tense with my studies and more comfortable with the way I studied, my grades improved. It still wasn't too fantastic but I'm satisfied with graduating with a CAP tad shy from 4.0, given that I didn't had to sacrifice that much over it.

Maybe you should give yourself less stress? Too much stress is counterproductive. The main purpose of doing the Master programme is to gain more knowledge anyway, not to prolong your paper-chasing journey. And it helps to stop trying to find external factors as excuses. To be honest, not that many people are actually full-time Masters and PhD students ^^; But then again, it's might just be in engineering. Good luck with your last year! You're almost at the end of programme!"
64096,I hope one day Prof Ben Leong can be invited as a Ted Talk speaker to share with us his journey as a NUSwhisperer.
64094,What’s the expected salary for a fresh grad applied math student with second upper? Should I even put 4K as my expected? Any seniors can advise?
64093,"I had been with my ex bf for several years, since before NUS. While on exchange, I developed feelings for someone else with whom I had an instant connection. I felt soo guilty that when I came back, I broke up with my bf. It has been quite a while but he still sometimes tells me that he loves me. I think he is waiting for me. The truth is that I still love him alot, but I am too guilty and ashamed to get back together with him. I don't want to hurt him by telling him I had feelings for someone else. I am pushing both of them away and punishing myself because I feel like a monster that does not deserve to be with anyone. I am just stuck in hall and barely eating or leaving. What should I do..."
64092,Oh didn’t know CS1010E is changing to Python until I saw the previous Whispers post. So is it possible for me to take it again so that I can learn some basic python? Do I have to write in or sth? Or is there another module for me to learn python from scratch? TIA!
64091,"Guys, Need some advice 
I have a Masters in Computer science and over 6 yrs of Experience as a software developer. I can code just fine but I don't believe coding is my core skill, my core competencies are public speaking,Negotiations, Soft skills  etc , I want to pivot my career to proj management or some stream with less coding expectations . But Recruiters see me as a Developer .

How do I pivot at this point of career or should I keep doing coding which is not my core skill?  Is it normal to pivot careers like after 6 yrs to different stream. seeking advice."
64090,"As I hang out with one of the acquaintances for dinner, I was taken aback when she suddenly ask if I had a best friend or someone that I could share my thoughts with. Never have I once given a thought about it. As I look back at my younger days, I was more gullible and trusted ""friends"" to have my back. In the end, I was outright betrayed by them. Ever since then, I was alone most of the time. I was deemed an outcast. I was looked down by many.

It was a painful experience, having to burn bridges with toxic people ,but eventually I got used to being alone. Having to tackle issues by yourself,knowing that you have no one to rely on can be daunting. Though I have become a better person than I was, I truly wished there was someone whom I can proudly claim to be my best friend.

And shout out to those who have been or currently fighting by yourself. It won't be easy going solo but hang in there. Find things that are truly worth your time and effort. People will come and go, so it's okay if they leave you hurting. Trust ain't for cheap people."
64089,"Hello. I received my results for Y2S2. Although I passed all my modules which I am thankful for because I was very worried that I will fail some of my modules, my CAP is only 3.2 after S/U. Is that CAP very bad? I am planning to graduate after year 3 since my CAP is so bad and I don't want to spend extra money on doing honours."
64088,"I heard that modules exclusive to special programmes such as SPS in Science, DCP/E-scholars in Engin, UTCP/USP have a higher recommended grade profile. I.E. While the profs for normal modules will give out grades such that the average is a B, profs for such modules will give out grades such that the average is a B+ or even an A-. Does anyone know if this is true? It seems kind of unfair as the students in these special programmes are likely to be academically above average already, and these programmes thus offer them a way to pull their CAP up even further compared to their peers."
64087,Is an intern meant to stay in the background and shadow their colleagues or do employers have higher expectations?
64084,"Hello Psych seniors, how does Honours Thesis work? Is it a year long or sem long thing and any recommendations for Prof?"
64083,"i have parents who are gambling addict and they owe huge amount of money to the bank. but i'm still schooling and don't have the ability to repay the loan. what should i do? after i graduate, i still have my student loan to be dealt with.
previously i helped to repay their loan and i left with an empty shell, now they have accumulated another huge amount. what should i do? ignore it and let the interest accumulate? looking for serious advice please!"
64082,"Dear prof ben leong,

I somehow survived CS but am not really that interested in the programming aspects. Are there any other careers that I can pursue especially that involve design, working with the end user and basically having a major say in how the product is designed?I have a cap of 3.2."
64081,"Professor Ben Leong,

Does the CS or software engineering degree have an ethics module? The more I read online, the more I see that our work is being used for horrible purposes like violating human rights, customer privacy, surveilling ethnic groups or cheating people out of their money through high tech finance. If us NUS graduates encounter projects at work that we dont ethically agree with, how are we supposed to think about it?"
64080,"Prof Ben Leong, what is your opinion of the courses at NUS-ISS. How are they different from the ones taught in SoC especially quality wise?"
64077,"Prof Ooi, for the upcoming academic term 19/20, you mentioned CS1010E will be switching to Python. So what’s the difference in syllabus as compared to CS1010S which teaches using Python as well?"
64076,Should I take MA1100 or CS1231? Is there any general advice as to which one to take? Thanks!
64073,Has anyone tried doing a review of grades before? How long does it typically take before the outcome of the review comes out?
64071,"To OP of #63988,
mate , if she was single all this time and you guys haven't gotten together, it's not gonna happen. Sorry to be harsh but I feel you should stop romanticizing the idea of her and just have more frame for yourself. Don't have oneitis and go out there, meet new people and move on man. Life's short - don't waste it thinking about what ifs."
64070,What kind of topics do interns talk about when interacting with new colleagues/bosses?  Do they try to blend in with the conversations or just stay silent and listen to their ‘adult talk’?
64066,"I'm a freshman who finished the last year with absolutely no social life during semester. I gave up everything just to get into the first class range. I'm happy that i attained my targets, but i cant help that feel like I missed something. Is it really worth it to give up all the uni life for grades?"
64065,Hi life science student here. Any seniors have tips or pointers for FYP or even got an A? Heard that it is quite hard to get an A.
64064,"It gets annoying when so many students start to whine about grades. The median grade is a B. B+ or above are bonuses..stop complaining!

64062,"Hi, I would like to suggest building more shelters around the NUS campus, especially near Innovation 4.0 (beside biz and Temasek life science laboratory ) where there is literally no shelters to any of the nearest bustops.

In addition, since the closure of biz canteen, a number of us  have to walk long distances to the nearest lunch outlet that sells food at a decent price. ( Forget about PGP canteen since we will probably be totally drenched by then. ) 

Some of us may have an umbrella but it doesnt help much in times of stormy rains, hence it is justifed to build a shelter extension near   Innovation 4.0."
64060,"Hi, my current CGPA is 4.06 and I have 4 semesters left aka 2 years. Is it possible to attain FCH? Or should I just concentrate on maintaining Second Upper?"
64059,Will they upcoming CS1010 special term use Python? I think SoC should experiment allowing students to submit work in either C or Python for the upcoming ST as a trial.
64057,"Dear Prof Ben Leong,

After your reply to #64040, i feel that i have gotten the shorter end of the stick after opting for psc engineering even thought I was offered psc open

Your thoughts and advice?"
64056,I just finished my 1st year and aiming for the Turing programme. How does the selection work actually? The criteria seem pretty vague though...
64055,"On behalf of all students who loved the UNIX environment used for CS1010E. First of all, I remember how students were frustrated with a keyboard-heavy interface but by the end of the semester, most would have realized how useful it is, and learned better-debugging skills.
Moving forward,  can anyone suggest a good way of using a similar environment for Windows users? (whether it is suggestable to get web services on the Cloud as access to NUS Sunfire server has been removed after the semester)"
64052,"Not a confession but hello everyone, could you recommend me 2k mods that require no pre-requisites. Thank you in advance!"
64051,"This seemed to be a weird platform to ask this but has anyone experienced before hives that only appears at night, turns super itchy and will disappear the next morning? It has been happening for a few months now, mostly starting from my legs, and it’s not really disrupting my daily life but it is super annoying and I can’t  figure out what’s causing it, as I’ve tried avoiding certain food, change my mattress, clothings and everything. There are also occasions when they appear when I’m outside in the public area. The doctor only prescribed some anti inflammatory cream but I don’t think that’s helping with the underlying cause. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
64045,"What’s up with revealing relationship statuses during camps these days? Will camps have activities that pair you up with other people in hopes to “help” you find a partner? As mentioned, why would they do that if you’re already in a relationship?"
64044,"So I’ve graduated.. with a 3rd class honors.. I should be happy in a way cause my CAP actually used to be below 2 after Y2 (was struggling with personal issues) and I managed to pull it back up to at least get an honors.

At the same time, I feel uneasy knowing that no matter my improvement story, recruiters are only gonna look at that 3.2 for 1 second and throw my resume away in favor of higher honor classes. I’m gonna be judged as incapable just by a mere number..

Should I even put my CAP/honors class on my resume then? Are there any graduates with a similar experience who managed to find the light at the end of the tunnel?

Having very mixed uneasy feelings now.."
64040,"Dear Prof Ben Leong,

After your reply to #64040, i feel that i have gotten the shorter end of the stick after opting for psc engineering even thought I was offered psc open

Your thoughts and advice?"
64039,"Admin pls don’t filter, genuine advice needed! 

Any recommendations on where to repair MBP screen (2012 model)? 

Not sure what the issue is, but blurry blots started appearing on the screen a few months back and now the entire screen is affected...

Rly don’t wish to spend $$ on a new MB since this one is still working fine except for the screen

TIA!"
64037,hello does anyone know how and when do the school notify prize winners for commencement? e.g. 1 week before commencement or not at all?
64036,"#63975 response to  @Nigel Sim comments, it’s funny how you assume I am rich because I studied overseas. Quiet the opposite actually, I’m from an average background where my Dad had to give up his stable office job in Singapore and work long bloody hours in gardens in Australia to make ends meet for me my siblings to get a quality education, as well as to pay my weekend tuition fees to get good grades."
64033,Is the final GPA recorded on the transcript important? Or will a good honours class suffice? What do employers look at?
64031,"Why does JC kids treat Poly students like some sort of impossible miracle? I from FoS and whenever they found out I'm from poly, they will have curious stares or will say ""you must be very smart"". You mean poly students who did not make it to NUS are not smart? After so long, it's unfortunate that poly stereotypes still exist."
64030,I’m entering Pharmacy this year. And I want to know if is it just study all the way? And if there is fun orientation stuff like staycation and pageants. Any seniors can feedback?

64026,"Anyone from business school that knows how to get a specialization in innovation and entrepreneurship (IE) ? This is because to get a specialization we must clear at least 3 level 4000 modules in the area of specialization. However, IE has only 2 level 4000 modules."
64025,Turning y3 next sem and i feel like dropping my accounting degree to a finance degree. Any seniors done so? Do you regret it? Pls advice.
64024,"Hello photographers,

By a stroke of luck, I will be taking up a gig to photograph and edit photos for a large scale conference at MBS. I have been the photographer for CCA events using borrowed DSLR a couple of times, but I never had to edit them. My experience is pretty amateur, and I would like to improve my skills fast. The camera that I am using is Canon SX60 HS. Any advice or tips on photography and editing would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you :)"
64023,"生死有命，富贵在天. I understand that not everyone can fulfil their dreams but I am still experiencing a mixture of disappointment, anger and jealousy seeing others get what they want. My dream is to read medicine at YLLSoM. I ended up reading nursing instead."
64021,"Does anyone feel like the FYP grading is rigged? The rubrics provided are pathetic, and it appears as though the FYP is a final attempt at grade manipulation by the departments to raise the CAP of borderline students."
64018,"It has been a tough period lately and the emotional roller coaster ride is getting the best of me.. I need to distract myself, and so, I am very keen to make new friends. Leave a comment here if you’re keen to have a new friend and I’ll hit you up. Really just need people to talk to - about anything under under the sun."
64017,"Dear Prof Ben Leong and Prof Ooi, it is not that I didn't study hard enough. Putting my terrible results aside, I would think of myself as a rather hard-working individual. In fact, for the past semesters ever since I entered NUS CS, I have completely sacrificed all my social life. The two most frequent places that I always hang out are NUS and my home. Granted, I know that most of my peers are like me. I would say that I have always been an individual who enjoyed studying and I do try to put in 100% in whatever I do. I have been quite disappointed in my performance, to be honest. 

Curiously, I find myself performing better in my GEMs and Math modules where I can get at least B+ and above even when I don't put in as much effort as I do for my CS modules. And I know clearly for a fact that if I had put in more efforts, I would have gotten at least A- for most of them. But in spite of this, i still want to pursue a graduate degree in CS as I think it is really interesting.

I narrowed down my reasons for wanting to pursue graduate school to be:
1)	I always enjoyed learning and i think that graduate school will enable me to further push myself and develop myself intellectually even further. Is my passion for learning and self-improvement valid reasons for wanting to pursue graduate studies? 
2)	It has always been a childhood dream of mine to attain the highest level of education possible. Since I am already taking a bachelor’s degree, why not go on further and seek to understand theoretical CS at a deeper level? 
3)	Given my low CAP, it is evident that I will never be able to qualify for the popular big tech companies (like Google, Amazon, Alibaba) which means that I will probably have to resign myself to working for SMEs where the job scope will most likely be boring, repetitive. I will probably spend most of my time having to debug myself or even my colleague’s code (Not something I want).  As an individual (even though I am stupid), I actually do want to surround myself with smart and motivated people.
4)	A research career seems ideal, in my opinion? Not only will I be able to surround myself with books/research papers, but I can also be a part-time lecturer and conduct classes for students which I think is a very meaningful career. 

Even if I eventually do not pursue a research career, at least graduate school will give me the opportunity to push myself to my potential, academically. And I believe that the experience will be a valuable one."
64016,"What should I do if I have no friends at the start of uni? I'm matriculating soon, and my programme will have a lot of people from my JC. They're going to bond together especially during orientation, but I won't benefit from it because I was a social outcast during JC, so I'd be either unknown or disliked by those people. 

Will I be socially disadvantaged because of this, and what can I do?"
64015,U town gym is so run down. Over half of their cardio machines are out of service. How do I get in shape and flex my abs for Sun NUS? Smh
64014,"Dear Prof Ben Leong,

Should I go for psc open or psc engineering? (Already offered; just deciding between these 2)

What do you also think of a career in dsta?

Thank you!"
64013,"Is it true that one must slowly make the girl like him before he actually reveal that he like her. Alway feel that from the the onset, the girl will know if she have interest in the guy or not n its juz the method of how the guy chase her, no matter how fast he goes. Like gt chance  mean gt chance. No chance means no chance"
64011,"I got my first B- today. It was also the first time I bothered to look at NUS's module review policies; $10 for a simple re-tabulation of scores. Where is the check and balance? NUS is like a company with bad corporate governance, where the professors are the management and the script tabulators are the audit committees, who have no technical understanding of the module beyond counting beans. The students are like the employees, who are assessed by management. They say the first line of defense is always on the employee, but what if the employee operates in the dark? Yes I'm talking about modules with heavy weightings on the final exams; there is no paper trail to speak of, no avenue to contest final grades on. TLDR: We need to have access to our final papers, especially if it has high weightings. How else can there be proper check and balance? We are no longer in JC, university modules can be quite niched."
64010,"Don't understand how guys would always say I love you so easily like its worthless. I mean, I hate it when guys say I love you to a girl who isn't your girlfriend yet. Because its just awkward and what is that girl suppose to reply? Ok? Thank you. Or I love you too? Lol. Plus guys should stop pestering the girl when she already dropped hints of rejection or friendzone. Like bro, you won't get anywhere like that. You are only gonna push her further away from you and when it gets to that stage, you then blame the girl for not appreciating what you have done for her.

If you really like her, please respect her decision. There are plenty of fishes in the sea, there will definitely be a perfect for you, but the sad thing is, the one in front of you ain't it. So suck it up and just continue with life."
64006,"hi seniors! if i were to take my primary & second major modules in y1, but realised that somehow i wanna drop my second major later instead, will those MCs read be used for UEs graduation fulfilment instead? or it’s just wasted? thanksss"
64005,"Hi there! I'm an incoming student and I have a lot of questions about 'student life' in NUS (Basically what my social life gonna look like). I'm curious because I have mad social anxiety and am worried about what kind of people I may come across. I struggle a lot with meeting new people yet enjoy having caring friends so much and enjoy caring for them too (Hope y'all understand what I'm sayin'). So yeah, here are my questions:

1. Should I join a RC or Hall? (I've already applied for a RC and finished the interview, waiting for the result now, planning on applying to a hall too)

2. If your answer to 1. is 'Depends on what you want', what is the difference in culture between the 2 if any?

3. Is there any culture of students helping each other out for school work even though they are technically competing against each other? (Damned bell curve)

Thanks for the help! I appreciate your time!"
64004,Was given the option to retake finals after granted special consideration for a few of my modules. Any seniors who retook final examination before? Was the level of difficulty similar to your original finals paper?
64003,Hypothetical situation but how do counter offers work? You sign on with. New company and your existing company gives you a counteroffer? You wait for a counteroffer before signing the contract? Hopefully some  experienced seniors would be able to help.
64001,"How long after the interview should the interviewer call you up? Is it needed to check if the interviewer is still interested or if the interviewer does not contact you back, it is automatically assumed I did not get a job?"
