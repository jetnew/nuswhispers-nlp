60999,"Reply to #60919. Why are you only talking abt guys. I've met girls who do that too. Even more scary and surprising than when guys do it tbh. They straight up cosy up to the guy and worm in to break up the couple, especially when the gf is overseas or in another faculty or another hall or something. But it still ends up being the guys fault somehow?"
60998,Wow...just wow...background. We have a presentation where there will be peer grading for the class. The module is on Engineering Professionalism.
60995,"Hello friends! I have a bit of a dilemma... I have been asked if I want to go for a selection for national team for a sport, but the selection tournament is a few days before exams, and even if I get in, it would be quite tough to balance school and training.
Hoping to ask some opinions so I can think a bit more about it, please be nice to me!

FOR TAKING PART
1) I'm actually a beginner in the sport, but I have a lot of experience in other sports so actually I can sort of get by in spite of my inexperience. I am legit ""not too bad"" so I would find it wasted to not take part.

2) I really like this sport, and I always wanted to have a ""cool guy"" image but actually in school days I was always quite fat and slow and gross so I want to test myself here and prove that I am a cool guy who possible to represent SG in something. My grades are quite shit anyway so I really want to have something to show for my youth and I don't want to be a regretful old fart next time. Esp because the world championship is only 1-in-4-years.

3) If I get selected, I would get to go to other country for competition, which is very cool. Even if I don't get selected, I would have fun at the tournament.

AGAINST TAKING PART
1) As a beginner, it's a bit arrogant and presumptuous to think I can go so far... And am I going too fast? Should I focus on my basics and go at it slow and steady instead? I feel like if I take part and screw up then I might ""burn out"" my love for the sport which is stupid also...

2) Although I want to grab this chance, I also want to study properly also. If I neglect my studies, then it's also like I'm running away from my duty as a student to do my work properly because it's a stake in my own future. I understand that it's only 1 exams period, but like if I bochup my studies here then I might do it again down the road then yada yada yada I will end up being a half-hearted human who just keeps running away from something that I'm not good at also... Then there's the factor that I'm not paying for my education so I'm wasting other people's money also...

3) If I take part, I will definitely get hurt because it's pretty rough. It would get in the way of my studying and my normal life also for a few weeks, I expect. So... it's kind of foolish to just try because it's not really ""nothing to lose"" also...

Actually as I type this I know I'm leaning towards not taking part but I just wanted to rant and hear some things back from you guys... :D"
60993,"I went for lecture today at Utown and omg it was soooooo cold. I'm not sure how the professors take this kind of temperature,especially since my module is cotaught by two profs. Are they just used to the freezing temperatures? I haven't taken classes in the other Utown Audi, but the one at town plaza is just positively freezing.

But then I saw my crush and I just got this warm and fuzzy feeling. She seems to be on good terms with the professors, and I find that really attractive for some reason. She always sits alone in lecture, but she always sits far away from me and my friends so not much chance there...

I kinda want to ask her out for dinner today, but she seems to be able to disappear after asking questions at the end of lecture, and this is even though her jacket is a bright rose pink. You'd think she'd be easy to spot..."
60991,Hi need help. Im looking to register for a post grad course in the US. However i need to accreditate my nus degree to get equivalent US credits. wondering which credential evaluation organisation is better? International Education Research Foundation? any agencies/branches located in Singapore that can help me prove that my transcript and degree scroll and assign equivalent US credits?
60985,"Hello, this may sound very preachy. 

But I just wanted to share my favourite quote from Louis CK - one of the funniest stand-up comics in US (but is now embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal). Regardless, that doesn't undermine the validity of this meaningful quote by him: 


""The only time you should look in your neighbor's bowl is to make sure that they have enough. You don't look in your neighbor's bowl to see if you have as much as them.""


I easily get resentful about the life I'm living especially since the university is filled with many privileged people. This quote keeps me grounded, prompts me to check my own privileges and prevents me from becoming overwhelmed by envy and jealousy. It's bloody hard not to covet after the glamorous things in life, but I think I'm beginning to understand that many material goods really aren't as attractive as they seem. 


(Conspicuous) consumption is in reality, over-rated, and many times, if we can see pass strategic advertisements (people actually take courses on how to make ads successful!), social media self-aggrandizing, and the inherent biasedness and partiality of the wonderful images that surrounds us, we might realise that an exotic holiday to Maldives, the branded LV bag, the Adidas Stan Smith shoes collection or the latest iPhone isn't really that big of a deal. My no-brand shoes actually feel very comfortable. I haven't changed my no-brand haversack for five years now and its still working very well, dutifully carrying all my heavy books and laptop. I heard my friends' Nike bag tore within a year (she changed to another Nike one). 


I have never been to anywhere apart from Singapore and Malaysia and sometimes i feel like I'm not worldly enough but also what's the point of going to romantic churches in Europe when you don't even know the significance of these historical sites and you're only using the architectural design as the backdrop of your vain instagram pic. I'll go to places that I find meaningful. Not just what travel agencies shove into my face and down my throat.


I can't help but feel that we yearn for these luxury items for the very superficial and shallow reason of making ourselves feel good, especially when we post our hauls and purchases online. We elevate our esteems through eliciting envy from others and i think that is harmful to all of us. We seek validation from being conforming to the glamourous norms we see around us. 


Maybe it's time we start to have our own opinions on how to live a life that we find meaningful?"
60984,"Hi, I was wondering what kind of jobs a degree in Economics, with specialization in Applied and Policy Economics, can lead to (other than govt jobs)? Any help will be appreciated, thanks!"
60983,"i feel like i'm dying in nm2209. the content is interesting i guess but i really, genuinely have no idea what the prof is saying. it's not just because of her accent (my english isn't the best either) but she'll fold her sentences over each other and kind of mush different lines of content together. after she confuses herself then she'll say ""you know??"" no prof i'm really sorry i don't know

thankfully a lot of the key parts of her content are covered in the readings like definitions etc 

yes i've gone up to her to clarify when i'm really confused by her. however, she didn't understand most of my questions and just reiterated what she said in the lecture which sigHhH aiya but she's really trying and very passionate still"

60981,"Is it OK for someone to copy your email (even though it's for the same intent e.g. reaching out to external sponsors) without even telling you? My PRC team mates simply copy my email that I've cc'ed her in, changing my name to hers, without informing me. I only found out when the partner cc'ed me into the email. I've confronted her and she said that she was about to inform me at a later date.. Post event, she even copy my speech and pass it off as her own as a ""thank you"" message.

It seems that you are just a insecure prick and have no faith in your girl. You resort to violence to keep guys away and this tells a lot about you. You are abusive and might harm her in future so please consult UHC.
Warning her or resorting to unorthodox method to keep her in your clutches only proves that you are immature. I have seen lot of guys hurting girls this way but they have the courage to voice it out but not pulling little tricks behind her. 
While you called other guys selfish, you are the real manipulative and selfish guy. It might be wrong to break up couples but should the girls just stick with their Boyfriends even if they know that their boyfriends are not the one they should be with? You are afraid of losing her and you don’t care whether she would be happier with someone else. Your love is selfish. True love should be wanting best for her even knowing you are not the one."
60977,"Women in Singapore have a much better life than men. Entry into university and hence opportunities for high paying jobs is equal for both genders, yet there is still a lingering Asian culture of expecting the male to provide for the family. 


As for the gender wage gap (last I checked it's 9%), women entering the workforce 2 years earlier due to lack of NS obligations definitely more than makes up for that."
60976,"Reply to #60959 and #60927.
I do not agree with #60959's advice. There must be a legit reason why #60927 really thinks that their relationship will not work. Tbh if there are indeed legit reasons to doubt if the relationship could work in the first place, why risk it and risk a heartbreak ? 

If all you want is just being part of their life, it is still 100% possible to achieve that while maintaining platonic relationship. Romantic relationship is not always the ultimate goal of relationships. If all you needed is companionship/emotional attachment from them, it is fine to keep it platonic. For all I know the latter may die out sooner than you thought. But if indeed at the end something really grew out of it then by all means. It's definitely okay to give some thoughts to this. Romantic relationship based on impulses is really childish and will not work out in the long term."
60975,"#60975 I hate to admit it but there are only guys who lie and guys who go for appearance. Even if the girl has shitty attitude but has a pretty face and good figure, it will compensate for all these shitty attitude and send tonnes of guys chasing for her. "
60974,"An environmentalist here. Instead of harping on the ""straw problem"", I want to address another problem regarding plastic pollution: replacement materials.

From what I see from most media, many single-use plastic replacement materials have the same problem: they are not waterproof, which is what many plastics products are designed for. In fact, many of those are designed to soluble in water. This defeats the purpose of being a ""plastic replacement"" since the job that plastic does so well (waterproofing), the replacement materials are next to useless at it.

I am no materials engineer, so I have no solution to this problem. But if we truly want to make a perfect replacement for plastic products, we need to remember what is the intended purpose of these products in the first place, before coming up with ideas like ""water soluble plastic""."

1. Your current standing already open doors to almost every graduate programme (work/ post-grad) out there. Ofc, you’ll need to perform well during the interviews as well. 
2. It’d be rather nice to be recognised—by having an extra word on your cert—for your effort if you managed to “level up” to the next range. 
3. However, starting pay only differs by a small amount. It’ll be insignificant after 2-3 years. 
4. No one cares about your class once you get the job. The only main concern you should be worried about is whether you can finish your work properly and being able to blend well into the office culture. *i.e. don’t f-up.
4. Your professional working experience and network recommendations will be the main consideration from your second job onwards. *like do you still talk about your PSLE t-score today?

60967,"While we're complaining about NUS IT I gotta vent about the engineering website. Seriously, the new website is much worse than the old one. If you go to the top bar, a menu-bar pops up but 4/6 categories are completely empty of sub-entries? It's like someone just threw their hands up and submitted incomplete work at the deadline. You have to go to their individual pages for each programme (e.g. IDP) and click through another 3-5 pages before getting to actually relevant information such as module descriptions. And I'm not a fan of the new-age style web design which is endless amounts of white space, text that takes up only 10% of the screen and forces you to scroll forever, and 1440p ultra-high-res pictures of handsome/pretty smiling students, which is of absolutely zero use. Oh, and large numbers of pages still have not been migrated over from the inaccessible old website, despite it being months since the change (tip to the poor guy trying to find out if he's on deans list, you're probably not).

For those curious, the current computing website is about what the old engineering website was like, and the current science website is slowly morphing into an engineering-like one (somebody please stop them). Frankly the new website is less useful and the change was not needed, and I strongly suspect some kickbacks were passed around to make it happen at all."

60963,"Everyone is quite privileged and blessed in one way or another. but I am not.

 Is like, 90% of a “normal” singaporean adult life had been cut off from me.

 I never got to go on overseas exchange. I did sign up for a bunch of CCA and internships but they’re all local. Can you believe it, I NEVER went overseas on exchange to live by myself in a foreign country before. 

And if you go work, you’d be trapped in a small cubicle all day with nary a chance to travel overseas. What kind of jobs provide good travelling overseas opportunities? 

I never went for any grad trip at the end of JC. Plus now I never went overseas on Any immersion programmes, what should I do now? 

Is there anything I can do to make up for the lost overseas opportunities I previously missed out on? 

 i never tried Starbucks/ jewel coffee/coffee Smith. I only tried kopi Beng and Nescafe COs they are cheap. I never ate at restaurants before. I don’t mean Michelin Star ones, I mean ALL restaurants I also never try before. I only can eat Hawker and food court food. Maybe macdonalds, subway, kfc I can eat, but the higher tier one should I really never eat before. 

I always rotate between the same 10 sets of plain clothes in school. I never bought a single thing from Zara, Forever 21, cotton on, 
OG or metro. 

I also got no expensive bags. I wonder if that’s normal?? I don’t have a single bag costing over $30? Normal girls will buy a handbag that costs around $100 but I am not one of them.

But after a while, I discovered that grades (or getting to the top of the cohort) doesn't matter as much as actually learning from my peers. I also realised that I enjoy helping people or sharing my stuff, and it's nice when the other party reciprocates and does the same.

60956,"Contrary to opinions expressed here, I've generally had a great time in CS2030. I enjoyed doing all of the assignments; the lecturers and lecture slides are crystal-clear, and Prof Henry's management of the module (despite the ballooning cohort size) is effective. 

He and Prof Zhao have set clear deadlines, answered questions on forums promptly and directly. 

I was having some difficulty with a particular lab, when all of a sudden at 11 pm, Prof Henry announced that he'd be extending the deadline due to popular demand. He had already extended deadlines for several previous labs. He even offered an alternative for students who couldn't complete a certain lab that was floated before recess week.

This motivated me to work harder on the lab, and I finished it at 12.06, six minutes after the original deadline. Despite not being amongst the students who asked for a time extension, I still felt relieved that I was able to complete it, because I was ready to tank the marks for that lab. 

Needless to say the module has been very smooth sailing and marking has been completely automated, quick and responsive. Any bugs have also been fixed promptly after feedback was given. Compared to the borderline fiasco that was a certain other introductory module last semester, CS2030 has been calm waters and smooth sailing all around.

Many of my fellow CS peers have also been of great help, and the TAs go to length to ensure students understand content. 

Thanks, everyone. "

You've been here for a while, talking to someone else about what i could only guess was an accounting group project, this happens every week, same time, same routine. It seems that we have a similar timetable, always finding ourselves seated in nearly the exact same tables. Yet somehow I only ever got to see your back view, because you always sit facing away from me ever so slightly. I never quite got a full picture of how you look like, perhaps i did, the image never lingers in my mind, but the feelings did. Knowing you're there while I'm working hard towards assignment deadlines somehow fills me with comfort, your presence is a special one. Just keeping you at the corner of my vision makes me feel at ease, like a long lost friend who you know can connect effortlessly, always looking out for you in a strange way.

60940,"I am currently working part-time in a retail job in a sales position while studying in uni full-time. 

It pays slightly better (basic $10/hr) than the market rate given by most other retail or FnB jobs around ($7-$9). Additionally it has commissions for products that we sell and a few other small little monetary benefits here and there which probably rounds up the pay to be about $12/hr.

Now, I know I should feel contented with the pay, but I feel out of place. This is because most of the other part-time colleagues working with me are studying in poly/ITE while working part-time. Most of them are younger than me. I rarely see other uni undergraduates working in the same company as me. I feel as if I'm doing something wrong, like there is something other uni undergraduates are currently doing which I'm not, and I'm afraid of missing out on that and not making full use of my time in uni.

My family situation is middle-class, my parents can afford to pay for my uni fees as well other miscellaneous stuff, and I'm not pressured to pay bills or take bank loans or anything like that. The main reason why I've been working part-time jobs is because I like the extra money that comes in and I can build up my savings (I've already hit 5 digits), albeit at a pretty slow pace since most part-time jobs don't pay that well. I'm wondering if there are better things I should be doing rather than working in part-time retail jobs(which I feel isn't very relevant to what I'm studying, I'm studying a degree that prepares me for white-collar professional jobs in the future but I'm doing blue-collar work right now)

Hence I am looking for advice on what uni undergraduates do in their free-time aside from working in part-time retail jobs?

P.S I tried applying for internships related to what I want to do in the future (high finance, banks) but I haven't received any emails back yet. I know that those companies are extremely competitive to get into so I may be looking at continuing to work in retail jobs if I don't get any offers. :(

They are probably so mean to other people as well. Just because you see them being nice to 3-4 people doesn't mean they are so nice to everyone else.

60921,"Purely curious and would like to collect some opinions from the guys (or girls). So i was sharing my views (with my parents juz now) with rgds to mate selection criteria, then they said something along the line that - looks are more impt than wealth esp for girls, so even if a woman is poor and lowly educated, as long as 'she' is pretty and kind-heart, most men wouldn't mind. They also 'corrected' me and say that woman are not obliged to contribute as much financially to the household as men do. With rgds to buying a house, they also feel that men should have generosity to pay 60% or more.

Other than this, they also advice my brother to find a rich woman so hopefully she can take the financial lead in the household.

Isn't it more logical for someone (regardless of man or woman) in today's century to have a tendency to choose wealth compared to just looks??? When i read nusw, i also note that some commented in a more A-A way and feels that man and woman should share equal financial burdens. So is my parent's thinking wrong? 

Secondly, would a lonely single rich woman really don't mind taking the financial lead for a poor but e.g. handsome man. If that is the case, wouldn't remain single a better choice? (at least you still have the freedom)

So if it was you in such situations, choose looks or wealth?, or rather remain single???

60919,"Reply to #60919. Why are you only talking abt guys. I've met girls who do that too. Even more scary and surprising than when guys do it tbh. They straight up cosy up to the guy and worm in to break up the couple, especially when the gf is overseas or in another faculty or another hall or something. But it still ends up being the guys fault somehow?"
60918,"In response to #60857, only the biz grad who become investment bankers or traders in a bank earn 12-14k. Every year there are only a handful who are able to command such a high pay. And besides the work hours are very long. Most biz grads take a starting pay of 3-4k."
60914,"Hey, just asking, what are we Auditors/finance bank professionals “supposed” to wear on a regular workday from mon-fri? I mean those who graduate already or those who are on internships. 

I always wear white blouse and black pencil skirt, with closed toe black pumps for career events and presentations, but I’m not sure if that’s we wear EVERY SINGLE DAY in the cbd area because I don’t remember seeing a homogenous flood of white on black attire when I went? 

Are other colours (not white?) blouses okay? Are dresses (pls specify what Color and what cutting) okay for the Raffles Place office?
 What about shoes? Must they all be black when you work? Can wear flats instead of heels? 

Thanks! "
60913,"As someone with decent grades graduating coming May. Here is a piece of job searching advice to maximise your search. I've had the luck of securing a number of well-paid jobs and this is my experience.

1. Enquire about the interview process, skip out anything more than 3 rounds of interviews (formal + informal). They are simply not worth your time and speaking to clueless HR departments is an absolute waste of resources, effort and time.

2. Apply across a different range of companies. Fortune 500 to SMEs, a lot of times SMEs pays competitive salaries and they hire people they actually need and not another cog in the system. F500 places typically have a structured environment across diff functions to grow in. Great for people still trying to find out which part of the work you want to specialise in.

3. Always. Always. Always thank your interviewers be it via a short text or email. Show appreciation for their time.

4. Always always negotiate your salary once you've got the offer. HR department typically has a tough time telling their direct hiring managers that an applicant they accepted declined their offer. You have the upper arm here. Of course, be realistic and don't ask for a doubled salary, find out the market rate and adjust according to the actual skill set you have to offer.

5. If a competing company in a similar environment offers you a higher salary, but you wish to work for another one. Bring up the issue of salaries and let them know you hope they would be able to match their offer. Companies typically want to hire people in higher demand (basic logic), especially so when the competing company happens to be a reputable one (you have the obligation to not divulge any names, they would be unprofessional to ask you)

Good luck and all the best my friends. The future awaits you!"
60912,"To OP #60862 & #60844, 
I want you to know that it's okay if you needed space to rest and have an alone time. It's okay to be tired. It's okay to take a break. It's okay to be afraid. I know sometimes you feel alone. But also know that you're not alone in this world. And that there are still people who cares for you and accept you for who you are. If you ever needed a listening ear, I hope you remember that you can reach out for help. In regards to your medications, I know that it zombified you. I sincerely hope and pray that things will be all well for you. Life may throw all sorts of harsh realities to you so I hope, despite all of that, you will grow to be a strong individual each day. I'm sending lots of love to both of you."
60911,Is it ethical to create a fake resume and post it online so that recruiters can reach out to me for opportunities? I see it more of as a strategy to future proof myself when I make a jump to another company. I will create a fake resume with work experience dictating the job I am applying to and see how recruiters react to my resume so that I can plan ahead. Is that the strategy all of the top performers with high salaries are doing? 
60910,"I'm original poster of #60910. So apparently im not seeing any quality comments that actually answers my question at all.
Allow me to rephrase my qns more simply.

Must you love physics,math and calculation-heavy topics in order to be able to do well in Engr?

I cant seem to figure out if I find certain physics topics difficult and boring because I'm crap at them in general, OR the reason i'm crap at it is because i find those topics boring.

I mean, im dont really like forcing myself to study stuff i REALLY dont enjoy soooooo.

And please, I'd appreciate legit answers tyvm, not just selective nitpicking of points I made in my post that warrants smartass comments."
60909,"So turned off by the first half of CS2030 that I did not attend any of the lectures. Finally got around to watching week 7's lecture, gosh, Prof Henry is so much better. Seems like it's time to attend lectures again."
60907,"Hi again, I'm the OP of #60907 (FANG data point). I posted my comp data with the best intentions, but somehow, they were misconstrued into something totally inaccurate. I find myself trying to slay the Hydra, where more heads appear as I cut them off. So let me share more details to shed more light:

My salary figures are not exceptionally high. If you can't ask your friends for these figures, you can always check out levels.fyi. They crowdsourced starting salary figures for each company and each level (including indeed). My salary is definitely within those band for the corresponding levels. Maybe on the lower side for the levels where I was promoted.

The taxes I quoted are accurate, and do include Social Security Tax (6.2%), Medicare Tax (1.45%), and Medicare Surtax (0.9%). It's easy to question how is it that I have such a ""low"" effective tax rate. The answer lies in the word ""effective"". While everyone's tax situation is different in the US, there are a few standard ways in calculating and reducing your tax liability:
- Taxable income is quite different from gross income. It is subjected to deductions. The basic deduction is just to take the standard deduction of 12.2k (pegged to inflation). So, my taxable income is reduced to 317k - 12.2k = 314.8k
- I maxed out my Traditional 401k contribution of of 19k. 401k is the US equivalent of CPF, but voluntary. Income that I divert to my 401k account is tax deferred. That means I reduce my taxable income this year by 19k, and any withdrawals at retirement are treated as income. I won't go into details of 401k, but at retirement, your income is so low that the tax rate for your 401k withdrawal is also around the 10-12% range in the future. So, now my taxable income is 286k
- Social security tax is only applied to your first 132.9k of your income. The limit is pegged roughly to inflation, so in 2016, it is applied to your first 118.5k of your income. This also means that for 2019 I'm going to pay 8.2k in Social Security Taxes (or 2.6% of my expected income of 317k).
- Medicare tax is 1.45% applied to all gross income (4.6k for 2019)
- Medicare Surtax is applied to taxable income above 200k. For 2019, I expect to pay $774
- Federal taxes are progressive. This means that you pay 10% on your first 10k of taxable income, 12% on your next 20k, and so on. Even though I'm in the 35% tax bracket, my effective federal tax, after all deductions, is 75k (or 24% of Gross)
- Adding all taxes together I get 89k, or 28% of Gross.

Sales tax is ~10%. No question that this is higher than in Singapore. However, groceries are not taxed, and I don't spend much in general. Fun fact: I buy a year's supply of shaving kit whenever I'm back in Singapore as you have no idea how expensive those razors are.

Jordan Dea-Mattson's calculation of 50-60% taxes is just plain wrong. Perhaps his back-of-napkin calculation used marginal tax rate, and unlimited SST + medicare surtax + no 401k contribution. If there something big I'm missing here, please let me know because I'll need to file a correction on my tax returns before I get deported.

Point is, I'm just another guy offering another data point. Most of data here (taxes, rent, salary bands) can be verified on the Internet. You just need to put in the effort to actually do those calculations.

PS: I could do an AMA over NUSWhispers to answer any other questions about my comp if there is enough interest. When there is sufficient responses, I'll try to answer as long as I can anonymize my identity and company."
60906,"Hi OP of #60906, 

Like you, I'm from year 3 CS currently who doesn't really like my course.  I didn't choose CS for money as it isn't the in-thing at my application time then. I choose it for stable employment-sake. 

I think I'm still ""sane"" (Having at least 8 hours of sleep everyday and a CCA, average CAP with average intellect) by your definition, so I seem fit to give advice in handling overwhelming stress.  I can't say how to improve grades or become better in the course as I'm just average, so I will give different kind of advice to cope stress.

In the midst of your messy life, do you know what you like to do? Both as interest and as a career? I hated software engineering, but I do like to code for analytics and using Excel VBA, so I'm looking for a more numerical analyst kind of job in the future as I do like math (numbers-kind). And I'm better at talking (talk big lol) so it seems more fitting me to do a more analyst kind of job than being a software engineer which is more technical oriented.

Find some peace in your interests. I know what I like outside of CS or math, which I find myself peace in doing these activities. Yes it does hurt my CAP but I believe that my health/sanity is more important than my CAP.

Jiayou to you fellow computing student!"
60905,"I am a diploma grad and have been working at a company for>2 years until now. I have been found out that I have been doing jobs search on my phone during working time by my colleague and he/she notified my boss. So my boss questioned me and I explained that it is indeed true I want to do a career switch to the IT field since I have studied IT at poly and I have a sudden interest to go back doing programming. At that time, I was already given a job offer by a startup and I told my boss that I will resign by 1 month time since the notice period is 1 month. However, I couldn’t make up my mind whether to accept the job offer by that hiring startup because I think there could be better job opportunities out there and then I could compare and decide on which is the best job for myself. So initially I emailed the hiring manager that I could not accept the job offer first and will let him know my decision by next week. However the next day, he replied that he has already hired another person who accepted the job offer instantly when he/she came for interview on the day itself and as such the position is no longer available. In other words, I was kicked out and now I am left with no job offer since this is the only job I have been offered despite going to multiple interviews.  

How can I face my boss now? The date for my last day of work is still pending. Should I stay on until June and throughout these few months, I continue to take leave to attend interviews?But isnt it obvious to my boss that the reason for taking leaves from work is because I am going to interviews which means I will be potentially poached by other companies?Please advice me the best course of action. 

Also since I have lost contact doing programming work for the past 3 years, the employers told me I will have to expect a pay cut since my IT knowledge level is not up to par and will probably be the same as fresh  poly graduate despite having 3 years of working experience which is not related to IT. Which websites do you think is good that allow me to pick up programming language fast so that I can acquire the relevant skills that employers in the IT field is seeking for?  "
60904,"#60904 I've heard similiar stories about how the QET test is not actually marked legit. I myself am still fuming mad I got a Band 2 despite writing what I thought was well thought out and analytical paper. I had even memorised a whole bunch of 'cheem' words just for that paper.

Some say the examiners just mark the first few papers in an entire row then grade the entire row based on the first few students' papers they had marked. Surely it's gotta be raise a huge all-out controversy and investigation if this turned out to be true? That the QET is just one big masquerade of a joke?
I dont know how true or false such rumours are...but really, this is crazy if it turns out true."
60903,I thought it was normal - but anyone else has not had a single day of tuition in their life? I mentioned it in passing and was met with a ton of surprise. 
60902,"I just did the craziest thing. I changed my LinkedIn profile and lied that I had my dream position at my dream company. I even uploaded a fake letter of offer on my social media and treated my family with dinner to celebrate successfully a job.

Every morning, I travel to my temporary job while wearing formal wear only to change to more casual wear once I have reached the workplace in order to keep up with the act.

It may seem tedious, but it feels good waking up in the morning lying to myself that I have found a permanent job.

Whenever I see my friends struggling to  find jobs, I even offer job interview tips and tell them ""how I succeeded in passing an interview"".

If someone from my dream company sees my fake LinkedIn profile and demand that I remove it, I will tell them to hire me instead so that it won't be a fake profile.

If you think that whatever I am doing seem meaningless, you have to consider how it feels to be unemployed.
