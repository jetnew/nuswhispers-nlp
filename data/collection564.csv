Hello! I am a year 1 student in CS. How would you suggest a CS major pick up ""business analysis"" skills? Should I take biz analytics courses/some types of business courses, or take a MBA/Masters in technology management? 
Also, how does one progress from a junior tech position to a tech management position? From my understanding, the junior positions are programmers/SEs (please correct me if I'm mistaken). Is the progression based on one's programming skills, or understanding of software/ technology, or breadth of knowledge in some other fields? 
Thank you very much!"

It is true that Dean's list is little more than bragging rights. But for those who have never gotten it or aiming for multiple lists, the list is a goal and an affirmation of their effort / academic excellence. 

Anyway being on Dean's list is public information, having a high cap is not. Such a tattoo has its own pros and cons in group work in university. :P

From an interview perspective, Dean's list will add minimal incremental value to a FCH cap. However, during your employment and assuming you are an above average worker, Dean's list (similar to FCH, scholarship, valedictorian) might help to augment the image of you being an top performer among other above average peers."
56490,"Oh about dean's list not useful at all you are so wrong. Imagine having a third class CAP with a dean's list. I've gotten high interview per application opportunities from companies, even a few prestigious ones in my industry. It was also the reason I got my current job with it. Not every company requires you to provide your CAP before the interview. Use it to your full advantage *wink*"
56485,"To #56438: Hi senior, I'm a CS freshman who has also been thinking about this issue, thanks for your helpful advice. 
Just a minor detail here, I think it is a bit strange to use the term tech bubble since technology has always been advancing. Consider the cavemen who used their primitive technology to hunt and start fires. Of course, unlike the cavemen, most of us wouldn't consider their stone tools to be technology in 2018. ""Technology"" itself is a moving target. Maybe you meant the IT industry as we know it reaching the end of its boom period. In that case, I also think that it is a matter of time. 
My opinion: Instead of a tech bubble, what I'm suspecting is an AI bubble. I think there has been genuine and fascinating advances in AI. However, it seems like the media is ignoring its limitations and overhyping it, and all the investors/people who read their clickbait articles join the buzzword hype/fearmongering. So it reminds me of the dot com bubble. But my understanding of AI is superficial, it would be great if any seniors in the AI specialization can share their thoughts on this.

Some context: 
Apart from general usage, I will be using the laptop for schoolwork, programming, watching webcasts (lol), but not for gaming. I don't intend to buy a separate desktop for home, and I don't mind carrying a heavier laptop to school, so I'm thinking of getting ~14 inch screen. I'm looking at laptops around $1000 to $1300 -ish.

Some questions: 
- Should I buy now, or wait for IT fair, or buy on Amazon/another e-commerce website? 
- Should I go for an i5 or i7 processor? (Is the i7 processor worth its price, or should I just get a better i5 processor?). Should I go for dual or quad core?
- Actually, which specifications/ details should I pay attention to?   
- Any laptop recommendations?
Thanks a lot for your advice!

56480,"With due respect, all research prof are highly accredited in their research areas and how many times they have been cited in top notch journal. Partly, this is due to them obtaining their ""KPI"" in order to obtain tenure. Driven by how many papers the lab group have to published, most research prof doesn't take into account on how student learning can be improvised during lecture. Even though we are top in asia, the teaching method is just meh. 

Research prof doesn't take into account cognitive load of student and incorporating the various teaching strategies. Hopefully, NUS can send profs for teaching courses (in-house) where student-centered learning environment will be established to allow effective learning. Sometimes I feel that educator staff does a better job in teaching than a research prof. "

56478,"To #56478:  Dean’s list is an award recognizing a top percentage of students in terms of their grades for a single semester. Depending on how well the cohort performs, the cut-off can go from 4.5 to 4.9+. In most cases it’s 4.7-4.8.

4.5-5.0* (First Class Hons), is a degree classification rather than an award. *It is also not uncommon to see dean’s list holders not having first class when graduating. I.e they can’t maintain getting average of >4.5 for other semesters or they started off badly.

Yes, Dean’s list is definitely a moral/ confidence booster. It’s a testament of  your academic excellence by being top* of your cohort. There’s even other tier’s of award such as book prizes (for the top student of each cohort). And the even more prestigious IES gold medal award for the top student upon graduation by CAP. The list goes on... 

Being invited to get the cert and some buffet event lets you network with other fellow dean’s listers as well. Also, there’s still a motivation for you to aim for SAP 5 to get dean’s list if you realized that a first/ second (upper) is no longer in an attainable range.

You can then tell your interviewers (probably you had some personal/ relationship issues) during the poorer performing semesters. Usng the dean’s list, you can still prove that you’re academically capable. "
56474,"@ Ryan Tal Teo, I am OP of #56421. Thanks for your response! You said “Typically, A is not enough”, and elaborated that interviews are conducted. Could I check if this means:
1. Scoring an A is not enough for the profs, so they will interview you to further assess competency
2. Scoring an A is deemed to be not good enough (implying we need A+), so because one did not get that A+, further interviews are conducted.

I myself was a chubby girl who dressed in unfashionable clothes.

But in the past I have had an almost rs but I hesistated (I wasn’t playing hard to get but I was just unsure so maybe the guy felt that I was deliberately making things hard) and it didn’t happen.

56437,"I'm worried I'm not cut out to be an English Lit major? It feels like the ideal person who majors in the subject has a Wordpress with pretty poetry and analysis in their free time, usually with a certain Aesthetic, neatly cultivated Instagrams with Vscocam presets and are usually Murakami fans. (Obviously I'm over-generalising, but this is a weird sense that I get that I feel I don't fit in – because I feel trashy in comparison lmao with my fanfic and fluffy stories)

 Besides not quite fitting into the ""aesthetic"" i I'm a little freaked out because I worry my skills of literary analysis isn't good enough, and I actually don't nearly read enough fiction in my own free time. I used to love Eng Lit so much in JC, but in uni now I'm not so certain I can pull it off. I loved Hamlet and The Great Gatsby and all, it used to be the subject I most looked forward to and actually enjoyed writing essays for, but after the intro mod I'm not so sure I can do it with books like Derek Walcott's poetry and The Bluest Eye. Maybe I'm just too simple-minded to major in English lit because I can't see what's so mindblowingly fantastic about these books to warrant Nobel prizes in Literature when all I see is a whole lot of pretension? Sure, it might boil down to preference, but I worry that a lot of the books covered in an English major in NUS will be like the ones covered in the intro mod in Sem 1, and that my options of study within English literature are limited.

I had to avoid visiting places we used to frequent as I am unable to hold back my tears when I am at those places (I wonder if you remember what my remark about me unable to visit East Coast park anymore in the future without being reminded of you when we visited East Coast Park during our first year together - it is so damn true). I am unable to even look at any of the memorabilia of us without breaking down.

I regret letting you go. I regret not cherishing you. I regret not telling you how much I actually love you. I regret not realizing earlier that deep down inside of me, I truly and sincerely love you. We did so much together. We went for exchange together, we went hunting for student deals together when we were poor undergraduates, we visited several Asian countries together during our university holidays when we were poor undergraduates, we visited more exotic places like European countries when we started working, we did sky-diving and bungee jump together, we studied together (or rather you helped me so so much during my undergraduate years). We celebrated so many occasions together - our birthdays, you getting dean list, you getting first class, me getting good grades thanks to your encouragement and help, you getting a nice bonus, me getting a new job, our anniversary or simply being happy that we were together. 

I try to constantly remind myself that you were telling the truth that day: that you have moved on. However, my heart and mind refuse to accept the truth. My heart keeps saying that those years and memories of us cannot just fade away altogether. My mind keeps inventing random explanations for your current cold and indifferent attitude towards me.

Princess Dinosaur, I really miss you a lot. Although I have not seen you for so so long, there is not a single day when I do not think of you - your smile, your cute voice or your big beautiful eyes - and shed tears over my stupid mistake. Although I am not a religious or superstitious person, I have prayed at multiple temples and made wishes at multiple wishing wells – that you will reciprocate my feelings once more. My friends have all asked me to move on as they say that you are not worth the wait. However, I know that you are worth waiting for even if I have wait till the end of eternity. 

I think you will know it is me once you read this post and I sincerely and fervently wish that you will reciprocate my feelings upon reading this post. However, I know that scenario will only occur in my dreams. Somewhere out there, in an alternate universe, there is a version of us who is still happily together and looking forward to spending the rest of their lives together. I wish I was that lucky guy. "

1) the girls who “LOVE” to travel to Bangkok and Hong Kong for shopping won’t even travel from Tampines to Orchard for shopping. They said “I LOVE to satisfy my wanderlust, I LOVE to travel around”.

If you are scared your employer will see your transcript, I doubt they will see the grade. They will look at the module you take, and you can always explain why you S/U-ed it and all.

56413,"OP of #56375 here,

@ Ck Fong
Appreciate your well-intentioned (?) advice, I agree with you on the cheatsheet part, but perhaps I should have provided clearer context in my efforts to protect my anonymity. AFAIK, there are only 2 modules with cheatsheets in the entity of the course. And those modules require more applied response so rigorous information would barely useful anyway. So what about the bulk of the other modules? Also, not everything is MCQ, and MCQs can be extremely tricky if they play with 1 or 2 words you have to specifically memorise to not get tricked. Not forgetting the exam conditions when time is tight and every option seems to be the correct answer. Yes, I agree with your second paragraph, but these questions are minimal and don't forget they still require memory work for concepts across different topics. As for your last statement, sorry to burst your bubble, but not everything can be ""studied smart"". Try memorising chemical structures, biological names, numbers that have no particular pattern all at once.

@ S P Ong
It's not as simple as that. Please don't misquote me, I didn't mention ""just memory work"". Memory work is far from ""just"" and is extremely intensive if it is expected for every single question. It also defeats the purpose of setting an applied question because whether you have a chance to approach that applied question is conditional on whether you first memorised that detail. Not really sure what you're driving at by bringing in your educator experience. Are you sure your class is not simply overwhelmed by the contents in your second mid-terms? (Open-book is one thing, being reasonable about it is another) This may be my own postulation, are you sure you didn't increase the amount of content because it is open-book? But from an educator's mouth, I am astonished by your condescending tone towards struggling students. ""Only losers whine about this kind of thing"". Wow okay, way to go, social justice warrior! I have a better advice for you, if you can't take ranting, don't follow NUSWhispers.

@Prof Ben Leong
You never know, eyes everywhere. ;) Nevertheless thank you for your input, it made more meaningful sense without that tinge of condescension in the former. I largely agree with them, although I am still against the idea of using the stick approach on university students since we are expected to be independent adults. That being the adopting of cheatsheets in place of open-book tests to ""force the students to consolidate and summarise what they have learnt"". Maybe I haven't clearly stated it, but I am not against the idea of cheatsheet examinations. I barely even have them! Or maybe I'm being unappreciative of the mere two cheatsheet exams I have, but welps.

@Henry Goh
