55599,"There's this girl who's taking the same mod as me, seen her a few times in lectures, but usually she doesn't show up... Today I saw her during finals, noticing her trademark red jacket, and as luck would have it I was sitting a few rows behind her. So I made up my mind to ask for her number later after exam, but she disappeared after. Oh well...

I think she's cute, and she sometimes sits alone or with one or two friends during the late evening lecture (which is the one she attends the most regularly) so it was pretty hard to get to talk to her.

She seems like the quiet kind? Well Engineering is a rather large place, and this mod is a rather broad mod with many courses taking it so what are the chances I get to meet her again right?"
55598,"Hi,
I’m an exchange student from China. I am very curious, why does it seems to me that almost every student in NUS will swear the f word. So uncivilised. I am a bit ashamed when I hear my peers swearing "

55596,"I just felt sad and jealous after reading #55547, having sex with different boyfriends but still not happy with it. I wanted to experience sex but cannot get a girlfriend possibly for life, and I am trying to find a casual relationship or even considering to visit geylang to experience my first time. But its not just that, I also wished to know how to pleasure a girl so I can make my gf feel good if I finally had one in the future. Am I wrong thinking this way and I will never experience sex forever, while all the other uni people deserve sex because they can easily find partners?"

55589,"I'm just wondering... what do you guys think of office romance? Recently just graduated, and met someone who came from the same course of the same school. Been seeing that person everyday, I've been feeling quite attracted to this person... I know it's not professional, but I can't help hoping that the person will one day feel the same..."
55588,"Fresh grad here. Recently I got to know this girl 8 years older than me. She's pretty and have a good character and we hit it off unbeliveably well from the start. The more I interacted with her, the more I fell for her. As much as I wanted to, I am hesitant to go offically as a couple. Firstly is due to the belief that dating a girl so much older go against the Asian values. Second and also more importantly, even if we dated for a few years and get married, she'll be too old to have many children then and the children may not be healthy. I do like to have 3 or more children if possible. Should I just call this off? Anyone has similar experiences?"
55587,"I am on a 6 month internship that is worth 16 mc. But I am screwed... I was working with another intern from poly and when he asked me some questions; I answered ""dude,... (so and so)""

I always used the term ""dude"" as it sounds friendly. But the intern sort of misheard and complained to HR that I scolded him the Cantonese ""diu"". I explained to my supervisor but HR is gonna issued me a warning letter. Sigh... FML... What should I do? I think it will affect my grades for the 16 mc."

55584,"To papaya, I don't know if you'll ever get to read this but I have some things I wanted to tell you but didn't find it appropriate to tell you directly. You can never imagine how much joy you have given me for the past 1 month plus, texting you almost everyday talking about our boring lives and most of the time about the weather and the mattress. However, there were times I thought you have your own life to lead and I didn't think I really belong to your life since we don't really know each other well. This is why there were times I thought of telling you that I'm going to delete the app to stay away from you. I was afraid the more I talk to you I'm going to be more emotionally attached to you. Everytime I wanted to break the news to you it ended up with us chatting more and i gave up the idea eventually. I finally made the decision to tell you 2 days ago but I almost immediately regretted it. I really felt weird inside, the feeling that i'm throwing away a friendship that I really want to keep. I installed the app after a while but couldn't find the courage to say hi to you again until today. 

I don't know if I ever get to talk to you ever again but I just want to let you know I won't forget about you and all the great chats that we have. If there's a chance let's be friends again! From Mango."

55578,"Frankly I think that #55578 has some point here. Most of us just want to graduate with a degree and at the same time learn some useful skills to apply to workplace. Not everyone cares about research as much as the professors do and to place a heavy emphasis on research while not focusing on teaching and imparting knowledge to students who mainly pay to learn would be in essence mean that we are producing less capable students, who go on into the economy to work. Some professors are paid highly, but to churn research which benefits university, which in turn boost the rankings of the university, but to be honest, deep down we all know that NUS as asia's #1 university and its worldwide ranking is highly debatable. Tell that to any alumni and they would probably secretly snigger at the thought that NUS is ranked higher than Yale. NUS has been playing this ranking games for the past few years, but frankly speaking, the calibre of its students probably cannot rival those in the top of china such as Tsinghua or Peking university. I have taken the famous MA1512 and many other terribly taught modules in NUS and am not impressed with what the top asia university has to offer. Ultimately, i don't think NUS would care that much about undergrads as much as the grads students as long as research plays a bigger role in the rankings and it remaining as a research university. Also, comments that say that ""don't go university lo"" are not really helping, instead of coming up with toxic comments, why not come up with better solutions to improve the educational landscape?"

55573,"Teachers are very important in your learning journey, and they leave a lasting impact no doubt. 

Many years ago when I was doing CM2121, I struggled a lot and went to consult the lecturer then. He told me in these exact words ""You will FAIL the module"", which left me super demoralized and traumatic. Thank goodness, I did not fail it. 

Fast forward 7 years later in 2018, I am currently doing my Masters in NUS, and I do occasionally bump into him. His words still haunt me after all these years. I do not remember the content of his lecture, nor the grade I got, but only these 5 words: ""You will FAIL the module"".

55572,"Not just about NUS but all local universities in general. Local U's like to boast about their rankings and about how rigorous the Singapore education system is, when in actual fact no one gives a shit about Singapore universities outside of Singapore.

55563,"  It was near the date of 1231, Dueet has reached the level of immortality that mortals such as Kenyu can ever dream of. He has become one with the ideology of discrete structures. He took out his weapon of choice, a calculator. It sent massive ripples of energy, spearing his knowledge and wisdom throughout the School of Computing

  However, Buzz Lightyear noticed this. To maintain the stability of the force within the School, he needed to take action. He flew towards Dueet, slapping him with a piece of paper. Dueet felt weak, as the paper started to drain his energy. 

  Dueet collapsed and with that, the secret of discrete structures were kept secret to this day. But what was the paper you may ask? Well, rumours said that there was a hidden spell written on the piece of paper, stating:

  ”Your calculator must not have the ability to communicate with another person.”"

The sensitive ones tend to be oversensitive and smothering, the smart ones tend to be too disconnected, the good-looking ones are probably attached...

The rich ones are insincere and think they can buy you, the interesting ones are too self-absorbed, god forbid you go for an older one because clearly he's been left on the shelf...

The evergreens are bad at sex and relationships, the opposite is equally problematic, if they're good at sex they're probably fuckboys and to be very honest, most fuckboys are terrible at it, so the good ones are the ones that you be careful around...

I hear my friends complain every end-of-sem about this kinda stuff and it's getting annoying.

I don't ask for much, I'm just asking for a guy that'll stick with me, and be there for me, but even that is hard to find. Girls, cherish your boyfriends if you have them, some of us don't have that much luck.

55556,"Hey, you. A mechie friend from 3-5 years ago. I don't know if you'll ever see this message ( I hope you do), but I guess it's worth a try.

I don't know how you've been doing, after you went to Stanford (and your friend to Harvard, it's quite a pity I didn't get to know her better, I hope she's getting along well, and attached with her roommate) for your Masters, but I hope that you've been well. Who knows, maybe you've gotten married already.

Well, I won't be surprised if you don't remember who I am anymore, as with many other people, but hahaha, you've left quite an impression on me, so... I remember you. Not sure if the impression I left on you was positive.... *looks back* yeah... Don't think it's that good.

So, it's been a while, huh? I'm here to tell you, that sorry for being a few years late, but do watch the news on Friday, Dec 7th, or Saturday, Dec 8th. I did say something about building buses a few years back, eh? And I hoped that you'll see it.

Well, after many delays, and much of literal blood, sweat and tears, I've finally able to show you what I've built (aside from that modification I made to the nus shuttle buses, the front handrails are pretty small and unnoticeable, but hey, it's something). 

It's not much, it's a type of bus, not electrical or anything, nothing fanciful, but one day, I hope that you, and my other friends, will be taking one of the buses that are built under me.

Or helped to build. My colleagues and Production Supervisors worked, and pushed alongside me for this one. 

Oh, don't worry about replying, though. I uh, don't visit here often, and I don't have a social media account (aside from Google, because Youtube). In other words, you pretty much can only find me in person (I issue you... a challenge, I guess? If fate allows our paths to cross again, it'll be interesting to observe you again as a friend. Though, it's actually surprisingly easy to track me).

Hahahaha, need I say who I am? Perhaps, it's better for us to remain at a status of ""Hey, yooooouuuuu......... Uh, Paiseh arh, What's your name?"". After all, madman for a day, strangers the next, eh? I've changed considerably, and you'd most likely cannot recognize me any longer.

Anyways, if it's any clue, I'm an idiot who drew on the whiteboards of the PC Cluster in Engineering often. Who had, and still has, a lot of logical flaws. I fold flowers, and I like to eat the half spring chicken they used to sell at uTown Koufu. That, and I like to drink Kopi-O very specifically from the Arts Canteen (more... fragrant in the morning, imo). Yeah, that guy."

55534,"Hi #55301, OP of #55237 here, just to clarify some things - she's been fangirling over him ever since they met in one of their course mods, and basically gushing about it. I'm not saying that it means anything, but she's been emotionally distant since she met him, and it seems that even though they just met they're abnormally close. I'm not sure about how you see it, but for me it's slightly alarming that they go home together almost every day, and I'm pretty sure that their timetabling can't be so ""zhun"" that they're in the same class for literally everything? Either he shifted his classes around to meet her, or the other way around.

Maybe it's paranoia or just me. But I can't shake the feeling that people don't get so close to each other that fast in under a semester without something going on behind the scenes. I've mentioned that she's been emotionally distant, and that we haven't seen each other much of late since we've been rather busy. But despite the emotionally distant part - she seems to be rather overeager? Like she's emotionally distant, but on occasion it seems like she's trying to make up for something and seems extra nice and stuff. I know that sounds weird, but to put it more clearly, she seems nicer and happier, but less emotionally involved with me? It just seems like she was trying to hide something.

I thought at the time that it could have been just my paranoia too, but the speed at which she got with the other guy was alarming - it was barely a month after we broke up, and I wouldn't say our relationship was on the rocks. I heard she went home with him barely a week after we broke up, and she wasn't the type to jump into bed with just about anyone - for us it took months, so I'm quite sure of some things, I just don't have any evidence. Yeah, I know I'm insecure, but I made it a point not to badger her about her male friends, I only asked cause he kept coming up in conversation.

I've been trying to find evidence of it for some time now, but I can't seem to find anything. I've been stonewalled by her friends and sometimes even by mutual friends, and she doesn't seem to accept follower requests anymore - her social media seems to have gone dead.

I know it's still conjuncture on my part, and I know all of this might just literally be me overthinking, but it's not a good place right now. All of this is hindsight, and I'm not sure of what I'm seeing, so maybe I may have been too accusatory. I'm just confused right now. TBH, all my friends tell me I'm overthinking this, but my head's not listening.

I know it's time to move on, and that maybe I'll never get closure from her, but it's hard I guess...

Anyway finals have ended for me, so it's just me, my thoughts and I again..."

55505,What is the purpose of living? I don’t know. I’m not good in anything. No looks and no brain. How I wish I was born smart. I studied so hard every single day but couldn’t do all the questions during finals. I have no friends in uni as well. Feels like I’m wasting 4 years in uni. Really don’t feel like living anymore. Seeking help is much more difficult than it seems.

55503,"I'm and exchanger at NUS and I'm actually really glad exams are coming to an end and I can continue my studies back home. Don't get me wrong, Singapore is amazing. The people are nice, the weather is great and the food is delicious. I just don't really like the way the education system works. People only care about studying and grades here. It's like that letter on your transcript defines your self worth as a person. And the worst thing is that I don't feel like I've learned much more academically than I would back home. Assignments are not necessarily harder or more challenging, but because of the bell curve they are more stressful. I feel like a lot of people don't aim to learn something, but just to get a high score on the exam. No wonder NUSWhispers is full of mental health struggles."
