61499,"Since its coming to the last week of school, I just wanted to share a short story of working together in a group. I was working in a group where we all know each other (""kind of""). Unfortunately, we had to do a group project in a topic we were not very familiar with. Even worst, over the past few weeks, I realized that they weren't putting in much effort at all and sometimes I feel like just tanking this shit alone. I guess everyone started to have their own priorities and academics, group projects no longer become something they would want to prioritize. I found myself stuck in this situation where I still want to do well and just had to put in extra efforts to make sure the project is not a complete failure but a part of me has also given up. I was doing the project with this one other friend and another group came up to us and asked where were our other group members. I was kind of surprised by how my friend who was with me at that point of time has responded. He said that they had other important roles and things that were contributing in the project but a part of us, I am almost sure knew that they had not been doing anything significant. Honestly, I felt that he was such a great friend trying to cover the backside of others. HAHA. But really, if it wasn't for him I would have started complaining. Oh well. Guess we all have this kind of groupmates in some point of our life in university. One that covers your ass and one that doesn't give a shit. Just sharing this to tell everyone out there that you are not alone if you experience the same thing. Happy Week 13 friends! =D"

61489,"Hi guys, I am enrolling to NUS CS next year and I have learnt from the NUS CS notes some modules. I am really passionate about the module CS1101S as I find it to be very puzzle-based and since young I enjoy solving puzzles. However, I do not like CS1231 as I find it to be tedious and boring with the exception of the topic on describing statements using symbols. Could any of you guys tell me which modules would resemble CS1101S so that I can study them and take these modules when I matriculate in NUS next year ?"

Fast forward a year, I am really tired of the office politics I have to navigate everyday. Culture here is really toxic, and work ethics is equally bad. Taichi and backstabbing culture is so common and either u master the skill, else you will be the sacrificial lamb. Ons between colleagues is so common, that people knows who slept with who the previous night, and tbh, I also engaged in such acts. 
I was sucked into this culture, and while I am rather disgusted by it, I find myself lacking the self-control to remove myself out of this industry.. Really hoped I have never stepped foot here in the first place."

61478,"After reading #61466, I would like to add on. 

I think couples should do genetic testing before marriage because who knows what deleterous allele and gene does your SO have? 

Your SO might look fine phenotypically but genotypically, she might be a heterozygous carrier of a nasty recessive allele. 

Don’t you think it’s dangerous to reproduce with such people and risk having a kid with congenital defect? This is even more important for people with certain religions that forbid abortion. 

What’s wrong with genetic testing and choosing SO with no deleterious gene? Why is it frowned upon? I don’t think it’s logical to love someone unconditionally and end up having to take care of special need children for the rest of my life. I don’t get why people criticize me... What’s wrong with my thinking? 

(Of course, I will do testing too. If I have deleterious recessive gene too, I will not reproduce as well because I don’t wanna bring suffering to innocent kid. Alternatively, I will find a person with homozygous dominant alleles in that gene loci to mate). "
61477,"During year 1, we were paired up for a sem in a particular module. We started to get to know each other by talking and then u started to jio me out to study etc. Slowly I developed a crush on you. All the initiations you did to me, I really can't tell whether you felt the same as me (One day after class I told u I was tired and u wanted to offer your keys to me so I can nap in your room for a while). 

So somehow we drifted apart in sem 2 onwards, idk why. While we drift apart the crush feeling also fade along with time. From sem 1 till now my friends still teased me that u liked me. Last time I secretly wished u confessed to me, but right now I told myself it's impossible since we drifted apart. Do u really have feelings for me back then, maybe till now? I kept psycho-ing myself that u r just treating me as a close friend, but having 5 friends and parents telling me that u liked me for the past 1.5 years, I got curious now. 

So have u crushed on me b4? I'm curious about your answer, but I dare not tell u in person. Also, whatever answer u had in mind, it doesn't matter to me anymore, because I'm happily attached to someone alr. ^^"

It's even more tiring when I have to think of something to text them just so I can initiate a conversation and find out more about them, of which most of the time the conversation just ends awkwardly.

So I thought I was in a relationship, everyone around me thought that I am in a relationship. Because when we go out together we would also hold hands and take photos together. Until one of my colleague told me to go and clarify with him our status, then he said that we are just dating and not bfgf.

“It is hard when you put in effort to get everything going well, but if you miss out on one thing, it is the only thing that is focused on. People don't appreciate all that you have done but they blame you for what goes awry.” 

First of all, thank you for your hardwork contributed in nursing people back to health. :)

I believe healthcare workers can all relate to this. Some may say that this happens across all jobs, but let me tell the readers that it happens the worst in healthcare.

We (aka Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses, Therapists, Dieticians and all allied health workers) are frontline workers who are battling life-and-dearh situations all the time, and even if not critical, we are healing people back to their normal health. Healthcare is a depressing place, because nobody comes here except the unwell, diseased or injured. People don’t thank us when they recover from their sickness, because it is expected that they will recover and walk out normally. But when a mistake is made, patients immensely blame us because they often overreact and immediately associate a mistake with death or serious health consequences to their loved ones. Even colleagues are harsh on each other.

In reality, being in Singapore with top healthcare facilities, services and professionals, we as healthcare workers pride and push ourselves to be perfect, so most mistakes are those which will not affect the patient negatively in terms of health outcomes. When detected, we’re quick to resolve it, cause “patients first”. 

My main points to the readers are:
- If you are from non-healthcare, both healthcare workers and admin staff would benefit from some form of appreciation from you. Even the most simple thank-you goes a long way for us ????, especially when we face sick, grumpy and unhappy people everyday. (Who comes into clinics/hospital happy?!) 
- if you are from healthcare careers, remember to give each other pats on the back and be optimistic. Optimism is something really lacking in our industry, which i admit i forget at times as well.

Long post but thank you #61440 for your contributions as a Nurse. Even if you are thinking of quitting, hope you get a vacation soon to rest your health!

But KNS ended up the account got fixed after CNY, so all the debts all erased mah! Then ofc I can't ask her for the money because (i) like it's so cheap of me to chase back 1 small meal (it wasn't anything fantastic) and (ii) the CNY mark passed to the debt is erased then if the debt is still valid then is like I sabo'ed her into bad luck right? 
So actually it's just a small meal so I can't really be bothered, but then I'm scared I offended her because like those very strong independent girl refuse to let guys pay for them right? And I understand la it's not like I'm her bf or anything so no good reason for me to chia her also...

People who did well in algo mods in retrospect started earlier (maybe even secondary school), do you really think people are going to just show hand and tell everyone that they were already mugging for codejam? Reality is that it's not going to get easier, you have to work smarter and leetcode harder. To evaluate effort at scale, perhaps it is necessary to incentivise demonstrable effort. I guess this applies to interviews as well. If you want to go OCS, yet never pass IPPT, a bit hard. But if you start training 3 months before, maybe can get gold also. Oh CS, once upon a time TC and prestige was low, but people still trained like mad and it was fun, sort of.

1. Avoid fiscally irresponsible people.  Never marry one or otherwise give him access to your money.
2. Avoid money managers. It’s your money and no one will care for it better than you. 
3. Avoid debt. 
4. Save a portion of every dollar you get.
5. The greater the percent of your income you save and invest, the sooner you’ll have F-You money.  Try 50%.  With no debt, this perfectly doable.
6. Put this money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) This is the fund you already own, so just keep adding to it (in USA context - but you can buy this / similar low cost index funds through overseas exchange through your brokerage, or robinhood if you have)
7. Realize the market and the value of your shares will sometimes drop dramatically.  People all around you will panic.  They’ll be screaming Sell, Sell, Sell.  Ignore this.  Even better:  Buy more shares. 
8. When you can live off the dividends VTSAX provides you are financially free.

61401,"Today, shortly after the crowded lunch timings I was sitting near the mala stall in utown Finefood. I saw a piece pretty big piece of seaweed from their stall lying on the floor in front of the stall, the walkway where many people walk. Then after a few minutes, the cashier lady (the one usually in red and wearing a cap) nonchalantly pick it up with her bare hands and immediately toss it back into their seaweed bowl. Hilariously, 5 minutes later an entire piece of capsicum dropped from their stall and rolled onto the same place on the floor. A passerby picked it up for them and placed it next to their cash register. Unsurprisingly, I later saw the cashier lady placing it back into their capsicum bowl without washing. One may argue that these ingredients are raw and once picked by the customers, they would be cooked. However, it just seems to me that this is no excuse to have such poor hygiene standards, even doing it in full view of everyone even though it wasn't crowded at that time. Before this, I did hear of people saying the utown mala has poor hygiene standards but this is the first time I saw it myself. Perhaps their monopoly here (at least in utown) has resulted in lax standards, or they never had hygiene standards in the 
first place. Hmm....

Tldr: Utown mala seems to have poor hygiene standards"
