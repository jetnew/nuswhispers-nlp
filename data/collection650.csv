65094,"I dont agree with #65041

1. Many men these days prefer cubicles. Those who have been abused before sexually or those with gender issues use cubicles.

2. The handicapped toilet is used by those with gender issues and where it is a guy who needs a cubicle and cubicle is not available he will also use the handicapped toilet.

I hope you learn to understand that there are different people with different needs.

In my case I am legally a male but have done  discrete surgery to have a female part. So I need a cubicle  to use as I cant use the urinal."

65089,"I recently just started working and all is good except I find it awkward interacting with my colleagues. In particular, I am attached to a mentor and she is a really nice person. However, during lunch, there will be alot of awkward pauses and pathetic small talks that last no more than 5 sentences. It’s fine when we are talking about work but other than that, I find it very hard to hold a meaningful conversation. I know it is due to my introvert/慢热 personality but I do wish to be more social(which i know is important in the workplace). Any advice on how I can improve my social skills?

It's just that this lie is honestly such a burden. Like whenever she express her gratitude to my mom i'll always give the awkward smile like heh heh. Plus the thought of her blowing up after knowing that i lied abt that issue, literally scares me. With her temper, i think a week of cold war is already considered a pretty light sentence.

So I basically had been sitting on my chair doing admin stuff, reading emails, playing games, planning for my modules, watching drama, reading ebook, planning my future etc for 3 days in a row at work. 

To be fair, I'm grateful for the break, but I'm also damn bored la. I tried asking for stuff to do in the office, but everybody is busy with their own stuff (busy until no time to allocate stuff for me to do cos they have to follow up and what not????)

65068,"I’m op of #64974 here. Today my fiancé went to withdraw $5000 from his bank account. I don’t know how, but somehow he managed to switch all of them into $1 coins. Then he loaded all of these 5000 coins into a luggage, and drove to my house. He came to my door, he said he was sorry for what happened, and wanted to give me something to show his remorse. At that time I didn’t know what was in the luggage he was carrying, so I opened the door for him.

When he came into my house, he opened his luggage and poured out all the $1 coins into my living room. He said “see, I’m not that poor, don’t you dare look down on me!!!”. Then he said I could have the coins and stormed out of my house. Now I have a mountain of coins sitting in the living room of my house and I don’t know what to do with it.

Now of course my bigger concern is my relationship with my bf, and not so much about the coins. How should i handle my relationship now? Should I leave him or try to mend things up?"

65057,"I'm the OP of #65057.

My sister still doesn't know that I've found out. I'm a female by the way. Thank you to those who have provided constructive advice. For your information, that teacher is still currently a teacher in a local secondary school and it seems like he's being promoted or will be working in another school soon. This teacher is also the 'cool' type of teacher that got along really well with most students, he's supposedly a really nice teacher but I guess deep down he's not. And yes, I used the term high school because I didn't want to appear too obvious in case my sister somehow chance upon this post. 

So now it's either I reach out to the teacher and ask him to stop this or I'll have to talk to my sister. 
If I talk to my sister about this and she doesn't listen/understand, it might ruin our sister relationship for life which I really don't want. I believe this has been going on for years (according to their convo and how they continued to keep in touch since sec school till now uni.) It seems like she's really in love with him and I'm worried that she might be too deep in this for her to understand what's right and wrong anymore. 

One of the comments also said that she's of legal age now so it's not legally wrong but it's just morally wrong and I'm worried about what might happen in the long term. This teacher is definitely wrong and sick in getting involved with a (ex) student and doing such things behind his wife and kids' back. It's just disgusting. 

Pls tell me what I should do. Or what should I tell her in order for her to realize that she needs to get out of this."

65052,"Op of #65052 here. One more thing I forgot to mention about this girl is that she has a weird habit. When she is in her room alone, she likes to take off her clothes totally, like totally naked. She confided in me before that she feels more free like that, that’s why I know. We have gotten relatively close friends btw. Another thing that occasionally draws attention from others is when someone knocks on her door of her room, she takes longer than normal to reply, presumably because she has to get dressed. This has caused her to have a bad reputation among her neighbours, some people suspect her of being lazy, others for other reason, because almost everyone else does not know about her true lifestyle.

I have no issues with the bad reputation part, because I can see it’s purely some misunderstanding. But I’m concerned will she have other signs of weird personality that I don’t know of, given that she likes this kind of naked living lifestyle? And therefore I sometimes have second thoughts about chasing her."

What a one sided thought you have when you recommend that the womens toilet should have more floor space allocated. As a guy who use the cubicle to pee I prefer my privacy and dignity. Well if you want speed then you might as well invent a urinal for women to pee in a similar open fashion. I dont think you will agree to that. Likewise I dont agree on more urinal than cubicles in the gents.

When the train left the recent station, an OL (with a bitchy face) pointed out that I should give up my seat because there is a pregnant lady (who boarded at the recent station) BUT in my defense, she was standing at a blind spot (where she was blocked by the people around her and a pole so I couldn't see her).

65020,"Anyone else has a friend or friends who question the kind of food you eat every single chance they get and it pisses you off?


So just a lil background about me and my friend. I am someone who likes to splurge on food (food's about the only thing I splurge on. I rarely splurge on clothes or makeup). Meanwhile my friend is someone who DIE DIE must always eat at hawker centre and if any kind of food is above $5, she'll give it a pass.


DISCLAIMER; I'm in no way saying there's anything wrong with eating hawker food (I love hawker food myself) or that I look down on her for eating hawker food (tbh her family's well off and she's just the super thrifty kind). Whenever I hang out with her, we'll end up at hawker centre even for special occasions. I can live with that. After all, I've other friends who I can eat at so-called fancier places with.


What I can't stand is when let's say we're walking together in a mall and I choose to buy Koi or Gong Cha or any 'fancy' food like Chateraise cake or ice cream and she'll straight up tell me how with that one caramel milk tea I just bought, she could buy like 2 plates of Cai Png. And this happens not just once or twice!


Before, I used to just casually laugh it off but it's been bugging me lately because
1. It's my money, not hers. I choose to spend my money however I want
2. I'm not forcing her to buy the 'fancy' food with me to share or what
3. NOBODY COMES BETWEEN ME AND MY BUBBLE TEA OK??!!


Like gurl, I understand if you don't enjoy those food like me, but let me enjoy them with my own money? You don't have to be criticizing every food choice I make!


This post isn't to seek advice on what to do btw. I'll let her know how I feel about this the next time we meet. But just wanted to know if anyone else has similar experiences with friends who question your food choices or who die die refuse to eat at any place with food more ex than $10??"

But for a stranger or even mere acquaintances to do so with some hope that they might hit things off with the person they're DM-ing, how probable is the success rate?


I've a friend who talks abt DM sliding as if that's how the modern millennial is making friends/getting dates nowadays in replacement of apps like Tinder/CMB?? I myself feel tempted to try that with a guy I fancy on Insta, but it just feels so intrusive and awkward should he just ignore me?? I mean, it's not like in the dating apps where you've intentionally put yourself out there to be approached right?"

65017,"I graduated from a very well-reputed university overseas. However, from the time I graduated until now, 23 months... I have not found a full-time job nor an internship (even unpaid internships, rejected). Now, I do not command for very high pay, heck I even applied to jobs outside my faculties. I attended job fairs. I attended career workshops on grooming myself for interviews. I even applied for frontline jobs, of which I did do some as part-time. But many places rejected me, and I have heard because I was overqualified and even tell me, ""It's a waste of my degree"", and I told them was perfectly fine getting the basic pay everyone else was getting. Honestly I am very burnt out. I still apply for jobs, I seek feedback from employers if I am not considered. Always thankful for those who do, because it makes me a better candidate for future interviews or shows why I didn't get a job. Sometimes, they don't want you if your ""specialty"" is something else even within your field. It's like you are damned if you don't study hard in Singapore. And damned if you get a degree because nobody is willing to hire you as a fresh graduate as they say ""you lack relevant experience"". Where is that experience going to drop from? The sky? I also get tired when people keep suggesting fix-it solutions (including my parents) when I really reinvent myself every time... with the same result.

How has the graduated cohorts of 2017 and 2018 managing? Nobody in these 2 cohorts from my university in Singapore were open about their jobs. Makes it hard for me to relate to anyone... Except one person... I have a friend who graduated from a Singapore university , well NTYU, and he did B Eng (Chemical Engineering with Hons) in 2017, and only found a job 1.5 years after applying.
