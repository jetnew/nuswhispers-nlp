Depends on what ""biz"" mean to you or what you want to get out of the business modules. Every module (regardless of the fluffiness) would allow you to have some appreciation of a specific aspect of a business itself. Just need to know that taking biz modules won't turn you into a guru in that subject matter, but merely offer you a flavour of it. 

-if you want to get an overview of biz flow, you will need to make sure you are covered in financing/operations/sales. Some general operation mgmt/mkting modules will be good. AIS/MIS to understand flow of accounting information from front to back end. Corporate finance and international financial mkts modules to get exposure to why/how capital structure and financing options could matter.

-If you have a more specific angle such as budget/operational/financial assessment in running a company, you can tweak some of your modules selection. Switch AIS to mgmt accounting, and see which operation/mkting modules are more relevant.

-if you watch too much wolf of wall street and want to pursue investments related stuff, you can whack a series of finance modules. Accounting modules such as financial accounting, valuation and etc would be helpful for looking at financial statements for equities/credit investments

Have fun. Can't offer examples on non accounting/finance modules since I watch too much margin call.

56197,"#56197 sounds like it was written by the typical salty biz student.
If you are the type to diss CS students, call us selfish for not ""supporting and wanting to make your million dollar idea come true"", mock us for not dressing smartly, asserting that such attire makes us unprofessional (If attire is the only thing separating you from an amateur, I really question what you are doing with your degree), and look down on other majors just because they aren't as much of ""moneymakers"", or ""contribute as much to the economy"", then it is of little surprise that you should end up being displaced.

Of course this isn't a generalization of all biz students, but this smug and scornful ""I'm better than you"" mentality seems to be quite prevalent."

56193,"Hi I will like to know more about NUS work study scheme. I am a year one, currently looking for part-time job to work but I have  no specialised skills. I signed up for being a tutor this month only do obviously I will not receive any reply soon. When I checked the NUS website out, NUS Talentconnect, I realised many jobs are like IT or business related but I do not have the relevant skills like coding and marketing to work there. But would anyone know the range of the pay rate for internships there? Will they be lower pay rate than a normal job (no experience required kind of job) or same? 

There are some basic jobs like HR, customer service or retail, which almost anyone can handle but those jobs, in fact almost all jobs there, do not state the pay rate, which is actually a basic information when advertising for a job recruitment. I mean no one wants to go for all the job interviews without at least knowing the pay rate right. It will be too much an effort. 

What is more, the student FAQ here http://www.nus.edu.sg/cfg/students/employment-opportunities says that there is no CPF deduction? How is it possible like the government will allow that? "

56177,"I talk to my current BF about my sexual history (generally just going over the basics that I think he should know) and he totally flips his shit even though he's asked about them. I don't have many previous relationships but he's completely focused on the regularity of sex and other more specific details. I made the mistake of telling him (after he asked) that my ex and I had a very active sex life, about once a week, and he completely flipped out, demanding to know when and where and all sorts of things, asking me how good it was and all that.

I'm not sure how to respond to this, on one hand he's asking, and will likely think I'm hiding something if I don't answer, but on the other hand clearly he's not taking this very well?

He seems fine about my previous exes since the sexual activity wasn't that much, maybe about once a month, but completely flips out over this most recent one though it's been about a couple of years back and I honestly cannot remember much.

For context, he's asking about details like number of orgasms, positions and places, and like number of times we had unprotected sex... and I think he even asked about total number of times we had sex? I mean it's about once a week, you did ask, why you flipping out? And like do you really expect me to remember this? Number of times we had unprotected sex well I understand perhaps it's a concern, but I did get tested and I do insist on protection with him, so I don't see the issue; is he just jealous I insist on protection with him?

And it's not like he's a virgin incel or whatever, we do have sex too, just probably not as often since he's not exactly skilled at it. If anything I should be the one who's concerned, since he's been slightly dodgy on his relationship past.

56175,"To #56166, if you are already a year 3 student and still ""not really learning much about the medical field"" makes me think that you are not paying attention in class (or maybe skipping lectures). Granted maybe your syllabus is different from your senior batches, you should still have had plenty of opportunities by now to source for internships at institutions, retail chains or even pharma companies to learn more about the medical field yourself during the holidays (for SOUL program if that is still a thing or just for personal enrichnent) or sharings by alumni organised by NUSPS instead of waiting for the dept to spoonfeed you information. There is a lot more to being a pharmacist in any types of settings than ""really boring"" or ""just a salesperson"", tbh its really disappointing to know that a pharm student thinks this way after all that publicity done to show the public what pharmacists can do other than dispensing.

On your concerns of pharm students having a bleak future, there are also many other things you can do with a pharm degree. If you do not have a passion in caring for and serving patients, you can always jump into industry or regulatory jobs (take a PECT internship in year 4). Or maybe you like the science but not so much interacting with patients or patient care, you can go for research, do a phd after you graduate. Skip pre-reg if you do not intend to do any jobs that requires a license. Or if you like medicine so much just go overseas for a medical degree. If you don't have passion for caring for or serving people (not just patients but their caregivers as well), personally I wouldn't recommend going into patient care jobs.

56166,"To #56166: Good that you realised early that you want to leave the profession. However, since you're already in your 3rd year, focus on graduating with good grades (if not, at least show an improvement...a good employer should overlook any crappy grades from the past as long as you can perform). Do your pre-reg if you still want a foot back into the profession in future, or if you still need time to think about your next step. Or even an internship with a pharma company before you cross out those who have 'gone over to the dark side'. There are loads of options in industry if you care to explore - regulatory, patent work, sale/marketing ($$$), health econs/market access, research, etc. If this is still not your thing, start planning for an alternative non-pharmacy-related career in your area of interest. Learn coding (good for healthcare analytics), take biz modules (good for finance jobs), etc. 

Through the grapevine I've heard that many pharmacy grads have gone into medicine, research, finance, aviation, business, teaching, etc. However, most do not wish to be affliated with pharmacy and are not open about their undergrad training. That's why you rarely hear about such characters. If you calculate the number of pharmacy graduates from NUS and subtract the number of actual pharmacists employed by all the retail outlets/hospitals (not just those holding a licence), you have a rough idea of the hundreds who are no longer practicing. 

Yes, most pharmacy students tend to be med school rejects, who either come from low/middle-class families and don't speak eloquently enough to pass a med school interview. No guanxi with good grades in SG can be a somewhat of a hindrance in a meritocratic society as you can see. But that's life, and you gotta make the best of your circumstances. If you really want to be a doctor, explore other alternatives overseas and learn the foreign languages or save up if needed. You don't necessary have to attend a recognised med school unless you absolutely have to return to SG. Also, it may be that pharmacy practice abroad (eg. US, Aust) may carry more meaning for you so try to explore your options and acquire the necessary qualifications to practice there.

Whatever your choice, you're lucky you realised what you do not want to do early in your career, as opposed to after 5 years of practice. So, get off your ass now and follow your dreams. And remember to encourage your classmates and juniors who feel disheartened about their path...it's a long journey and a big big world out there..."

56161,"Hi! I am CS year 1, I’ve seen some useful CS advice around here, so I am hoping you guys can help me with some career advice too. I am interested in working in the technology sector. I enjoy programming and CS - I think of programming as a puzzle game with specific rules, and I think using technology to solve real world problems is meaningful. 

However, I do not wish to have a job where the only thing I do is code, for 2 reasons. Firstly, I think it would be too excessive. Just as we should not play too much games, I think I should not be programming excessively (eg for health, eyesight, relationship reasons). 

Secondly, from my understanding, programming is not the only skill needed to work in technology. If I only work on programming skills, I will probably end up with a short-lived career. Tech companies seem to prefer younger programmers and Software Engineers for their learning ability. When I am older and perhaps unable to learn as quickly as I can now, I would like to still have relevant and useful skills to contribute. 

I am aware that programming is simply a tool, and programming != CS. But I have heard that most CS graduates become Software Engineers, a job that entails spending most of one’s time coding (pls correct me if I am mistaken). 

So I wish to ask: 
1. How do Software Engineers avoid the aforementioned problems? 
2. What other skills should I be learning if I wish to work in the technology sector? 
3. In your opinion, which CS specialization(s) have useful applications/ good opportunities for innovation?

Or perhaps we can have marriage as a vow for celibacy b/w consenting parties but they are free to do whatever they like outside/before marriage"
56130,"Regarding the recent saga on fwb, I want to address 2 points. Point 1: Why it’s not advised for girls to have fwb? Point 2: Why men are not held up to the same standard?

I’m not gonna talk about human constructs like morality, religion or sociology. Instead I’ll address the issue through science, more specifically evolutionary biology, psychology and physiology (I’m a life science undergrad btw). 

Based on evolutionary biology and psychology, males are hard wired via natural selection to engage in casual sex because they can greatly increase their reproductive success and number of offspring, thus increasing his evolutionary fitness. Thus, this “promiscuous or polygamous” gene is passed on from generations to generations and is hard wired in male. Take a look at the animal kingdom, majority of the mammalian mating system (which humans are part of) is polygamy. Basically, relationship is fleeting, ie. touch and go, seed as many female as possible to maximize reproduction fitness. That’s why it’s not surprising to see players use terms like “I conquered x number of girls” or disappear into thin air after sex (hence the phrase “fk and go”). Furthermore, males are wired to be put off by female right after they orgasm (during sexual refractory period). This is to prevent repeated pointless seeding and to conserve energy and nutrient (aka. sperm and cum). That’s why guys are generally disinterested in girls after fwb sex. Lastly, it is in the interest of the male if he has sex with different female because it will enhance genetic diversity. Hence, males is easier to get bored with repeated sex with a same female. 

For mammalian female, they benefit more from being choosy due to the demands of gestation, breastfeeding and duty to nurture offspring. They maximize their reproduction fitness by being heavily invested emotionally to the male in order to seek security and protection during vulnerable periods like gestation. That’s why you see girls becoming clingy and emotionally attached after sex. Also, being choosy turns guy on because they are wired to thrive in competition and fight to mate with female. Female who have sex easily with guys are not choosy. As a result, words like “cheap”, “slut” and “easy to get” emerged and are used to tag these women, and only women but not men. 

Although the invention of contraception eliminated risk of childbearing, the human genes and innate instincts (shaped by thousands of years of evolution) don’t understand about modern contraception. The subconscious male and female brain still associate sex with reproduction and the series of psychology and emotion described above still gets triggered automatically during sex. 

Even if the girl so happen to have gained a rare spontaneous loss of function mutation in your gene and all the above physiology and psychology don’t apply to you, remember that your fwb most likely will still have these hard wired instincts. 

Basically, male and female have fundamental differences biologically. Comparing the 2 sexes is like comparing apple to orange (or should i say banana to abalone). It is simplistic to fight blindly for equality without addressing these intrinsic differences. 

I’m not condemning girls having fwb. I just hope to share my information so that girls can weigh the benefit and cost. Girls having fwb is taboo for a reason, and I don’t think it’s purely because of social reasons such as female oppression, religion or ancient conservative culture. "

56119,"the author of #56104:

i'm a woman, and the more sexual partners a guy has had, the lower his ""value"" to me too. your theory that it only applies to girls makes no sense. whatever you think about sleeping around, you should be willing to apply it equally to all genders.

also you should probably spend less time reading these 'theories' on reddit."
56118,"Maybe let me offer a different view on sexual exclusivity? Graduated from NUS, married with kids and now doing okay in the financial industry to be given a corner office in the financial district.

You people may be too hung up about sexual exclusivity in a relationship. Yes it is good to monogamous after marriage, but have seen way too many examples to know that sexual exclusivity is not a necessity for a happy marriage, or relationship. For all the romantics, affairs are way more common than you think. Try throwing a rock in the mbfc area and you are more likely than not to hit someone who slept with someone outside a relationship. The anxiety and anguish over loss of sexual exclusivity is what causes people to hide affairs in the first place.

I used to be a romantic for monogamy too, until my husband confessed that he was sleeping with a colleague. At first I felt angry and divorce was on my mind. Then after a night of cool down, I was not going to dismantle my family because he stuck his dick in another female's hole. He was and is still a loving husband and father. 

For the sake of the kids, I told him no divorce if I could have my own fwbs too. Funny how when the tables are turned, males start reconsidering their actions. He agreed though, and the kids were none the wiser. In my industry, well-dressed, good-looking people working long hours together are conducive grounds for finding fwbs, and it was not difficult for me to find my own (two is all I can handle).

Of course, there are ground rules, like protection to be worn at all times, to let each other know before liaisons with the fwbs, no getting pregnant or impregnating an fwb, and that family time is of paramount priority. I also go for and get my fwbs to go for regular health screenings. You are wrong if you think the sex is very frequent because we all lead busy lives. It's more like a catch up lunch, then followed by some private time together.

Some will judge me for this, and I don't care. My value as a female, mother and employee does not decrease because of the number of dicks I explored. Similarly, my husband's value as a male and father does not increase because of the number of females he stuck his dick into. Perversely, maybe due to the male ego, my husband insists on a session with me after he knows I had a liaison with one of my fwbs. Letting go of our insistence on sexual exclusivity has returned the much-needed spark to our relationship which has honestly gone stale before this.

For the girl who slept with her colleague, you should be honest with your boyfriend. If he cannot accept sexual non-exclusivity while you crave it, then you guys are not suited for each other. Find someone who can accept this craving of yours and you will be much happier.

This ability to let go of insisting on sexual exclusivity is not for everyone, and many will have a hard time accepting it. But this is an option for those who are unsure of a way forward."
56116,"Hey guys, need some advice here. I suspect my brother has serious anger management issues and it is really getting on my nerves.

I saw a completely different side of him and frankly speaking, it was quite scary. However, it seems like the more I ignore him, the more overboard he gets. He is now at it every single day. I think the reason why he became like this was due to poor parenting on the part of my mum who have always been giving in and tolerating his shit behaviour since young.

i'm a woman, and the more sexual partners a guy has had, the lower his ""value"" to me too. your theory that it only applies to girls makes no sense. whatever you think about sleeping around, you should be willing to apply it equally to all genders.

also you should probably spend less time reading these 'theories' on reddit."

56101,Is it possible to do a mutual swap for PGP accommodation? I've got Single B but I want Single A
56100,"Looks like its getting into a trend in Singapore to stay single now at post 25, looks like being single at post 25 is starting to be cool nowadays. The greatest winners for guys in 2018 are not those who chase the girl of his dream and winning her heart eventually but rather those who choose not give in to the concept of a BGR and guys being ""nice"" to girls but rather living a lavish and luxurious lifestyle  all by themselves. If this trend continues, we are moving in the direction of greater gender equality where may be 10, 20 years down the road, we will achieve gender equality in Singapore in terms of relationships. "
