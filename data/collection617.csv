The question is what did the authorities said to her EXACTLY as to why the perpetrator was let off easily?

61793,"#61793: Can just post it if it is true. so far, i have not heard of any guys suing for defamation when they are a perpetrator of sex crime. they will threaten and hope the victim dont take any action. this is just legal intimidation.  empty threats. 

they definitely wont sue. reason that they will not sue is because: 
1. they did it. 
2. so when it comes to legal proceeding they are at a loss, it cast a very negative light on them. and the whole world will know they did it
3. after losing the civil suit of defamation, they will still face criminal proceedings

they would rather threaten and hope you are intimidated, and dont even report to police.

whatever happens, just report to police and post on social media to warn other potential victims. 

today it is you, tmr it could be someone else. zero tolerance to sex crimes. do not be scared. even if you receive a legal letter, seek counsel, and post.

61786,"I would like to share a very meaningful lesson I've seen some time ago, and it resonates more and more with me over time.

You can check it out here, but let me share what I've derived from this below which slightly deviates from his.
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RBG1PadWI

My Life lessons:
1. Life is inherently meaningless. 

We are biologically coded to go through this cycle of birth, reproduction, death. There is nothing to lose or to gain at the end of the day. As sentient beings with the ability to think (be it logically and illogically), we are pushed into this miserable cycle with no purpose. For those approaching midlife crisis, you'll understand deeply our craving for MEANING. We try to find purpose from the people around us like spouse, children, family, friends, the less fortunate. But I see this as being analogous to two people freezing in an ice land with zero chance of escaping while they just rub each other trying to get some warmth. 

But fortunately we are also biologically coded to feel so damn good when we help others and get appreciated. Everybody's got their own level of thirst for this form of satisfaction, look around for your friends who seem too friendly, too outgoing, too helpful, their thirst is high. If you deprive such people of the appreciation they need, they'll just dive straight into depression, and discover the meaningless of everything.

2. Your happiness lies in other people's hands.

Just like the analogy mentioned previously, ""two people freezing in an ice land"", these 2 people may not find meaning in their death BUT if they spend their last minutes hugging each other out knowing that their warmth will make the other feel better, they will derive happiness and meaning during their time alive. You will find no meaning in rubbing yourself to produce some warmth. However, it is important to note, happiness is derived from the appreciation from others, not purely from your act of kindness. So, in this journey called life with a meaningless end point (death), if you seek meaning of your life, go be nice to people around you. And if you're lucky, some of the people in your life give you the appreciation you need. 

Side track, if you have an insurance friend, you'll see him posting on ig, fb or any other public platforms all the time thanking the people around him, appreciating the people around him. Appreciation is something that can be free coming from you, but priceless for those who receive it. It is an emotional drug that people need to fight the meaningless of life.

So, go out be active in showing appreciation to the people around you. Not everybody has got the fortune to have appreciative friends. Be appreciative to all, the cashiers, the cleaners, the lecturers, everybody. Depression can be found in tears and also the widest smile. You may be saving a life with a smile and thank you."
61785,"Recently some things happened which made me doubt whether true love exists. A couple of years ago, my uncle's business failed and he was made a bankrupt. He sold all his nice cars and property and his family's lifestyle underwent a huge downgrade. His wife left him soon after. One of my neighbours became permanently disabled in the legs after an accident and will need someone to take care of him for his life. His wife left him not long after too. I am hesitant about marriage after seeing these things. I think people only show their true colours in a crisis and all those things people say to their partners about staying by their side no matter what is just lip service. Right now, my relationship is rather smooth sailing and there is no way I can tell my girlfriend (or future wife) will stay until a big crisis happens. What should I do to protect myself in this case?"
61781,"Responding to: #61657. I think your argument and post is extremely problematic and counter-productive in improving the quality and support of local television. Yes, a large portion of the demographic captured by Mediacorp is comprised of members of the pioneer generation - but that's exactly and only because they're the captive market. Mediacorp has no competition for the viewer who has no access to cable television, or the knowledge or will to use the internet. Given the option of better programming, I have little doubt that older generations would also make the switch.

While you might be correct that there exist, at least in theory, a positive effect that might result from the covert PSAs littered in the storyline of local TV, you should also keep in mind (a) that it's exactly these PSAs that appear to turn off so many others from watching (if you care any at all about viewership from other demographics). (b) There is also equal opportunity for local tv to be used by corporate entities for covert advertising (read: unethical product placement). (c) It is doubtful that these efforts have any impact in encouraging cross-generational dialogue any way- the shows themselves certainly won't serve as a common topic if nobody under the age of 30 has ever watched them. And (d) there is a question about how accurate is their depiction of Singaporean worries and troubles if they only ever deal with these questions with the bureaucratically sanctioned sanitised kiddy gloves that appear to be issued with every show. 

The truth is that Mediacorp is losing viewers and will continue to lose viewers regardless of how people talk about it. Even the younger generations that you cite as once watching okto and kids central, now have smartphones and are internet-savvy enough to utilise YouTube. The solution to bring them back shouldn't be to remove their phones (though I think removing their phones is a good idea) and strapping them to a chair facing an okto original- it should be to improve programming to speak to the cultural and Singaporean-specific problems and worries that the youth have. If you want to support any product (local or not), your task shouldn't be to convince people to buy it regardless of its quality, it should be to support the improvement of the product so that it can stand on its own merits. And if the only people who watch it, are the people who have nothing else to watch, then it simply isn't very good.

Good art serves a purpose in society. It creates a shared national identity that transcends economic, racial, and generational differences; it serves as catharsis for the anxieties that are unique to the Singaporean experience. There's so much more that local television can be, and we do disservice to the industry if we say that we should support it regardless of what it's currently like. If you want to support the local tv industry, then demand more from the company, not the consumer."
61780,"Just an opinion, I strongly agree that the punishment was not severe enough and feel sad for the victim.  However, I do not support this social justice thing. Blowing the matter up on social media is akin to taking the law into one’s own hands.

While I have not experienced the trauma that she is going through right now, I truly sympathise with her. However, I urge everyone to think about the repercussions of their actions before hastily sharing her posts.

If the guy is clearly unrepentant, then yes, as a community of NUS students condemn him in unity. But without perfect information, I think we are doing him a great injustice and are likely sentencing him to a fate far worse than the law would ever have. Persecution from the whole country is far worse than going to jail. What if this guy was in fact truly repentant?
"
61779,"Lets see if this gets posted or not 

It seems many people have started talking about the voyeurism saga and NUS (and maybe even the police's) inadequate response. But I do find it interesting that while there may have been a few direct victims (the family, close friends etc), almost all my friends react just as strongly as if they were wronged. 

They tell me to think about ""what if you were the victim here"" but I clearly am not. Honestly, I would like to have discussions of these sort without people just going ""ITS WRONG NUS BAD CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE"" and if I shown any sign of resistance I'm blacklisted as a friend (like really? You know me for a few years now and you can threaten to unfriend me because of this? The last time this happened I was 8 years old)

I'm honestly curious about something (and obviously I cant be bothered to ask my friends when there seems to be a high risk that I'm misunderstood with REAL consequences) what do YOU guys think is appropriate punishment? 

Some seem to say a jail term is effective, both the experience and the permanent criminal charge. Some suggested expulsion as the minimum (also note that all Singapore Unis will know why you have been expelled). Fines seem to be warranted but I'm not a law student (neither are my friends) so the fine seems to just be ""whatever the law decides"" - even though it was the law that allowed a 12 months warning period. 

I'm legit curious what would have been an acceptable or applaudable action by the police, school, or both and any other party involved. It seems the few friends that do indulge me give all sort of responses that I'm more confused what should be done (although it seems like they are quite comfortable over-punishing versus under-punishing...which i am not)"
61777,"Strongly agree with #61777.

In my honest opinion, in this particular case yes the victim wants justice which is right and proper, but what she feels most sad from what I've been reading seems to be her disappointment and anger that this has happened on more than a few occasions, and in I'm understanding her correctly what she wants most is for the same thing never to happen to anyone else again. Rather than for everyone else to play judge, I think the victim reiterates very clearly that she wants there to be compulsory re-education or community service, which is something within the powers of the school. Again, prison sentences are not within the power of the school nor the police but the courts, and it would be crazy to bring corporal punishment into the university setting.

The suspension by itself unfortunately doesn't go any way to ensuring that there is going to be any change in the mindset and behaviour. It's like going to a 'some sort of therapy centre' (see Youtube and you'll see what I'm talking about), and saying ""It's OK, I'm dealing with this myself, no need for the police."" For some, yes a suspension is good enough for them to reflect on their actions, sincerely make up to the victim and never do it again. But for others who are more stubborn, this will not work. Something more helpful in changing all offenders and be of better use to the victims would be to institute community service & compulsory re-education during that suspension, and with someone (whether it's a counsellor or etc) to track the offender's progress for a full semester to see if the offender is ready to earn his second chance. Random phone spot checks for the offender (again this might be a privacy concern to some but I think at least for the period of his suspension it seems fair) or instituting a curfew for the period of the suspension if it's easier to strike at night.

On the other hand, I've been for rehabilitative measures where possible because I think what brings closure to the victim is that this shit doesn't happen again. You can jail the offender but if he ends up being that 25% of inmates who reoffend despite going through such a harsh punishment what you end up with is a hardened criminal, who may do even worse things in future. Our society still has some way to go in reintegrating former criminals after they complete their sentence, which is why we need to be cautious when we call for jail sentences because 1 in 4 will reoffend. Being tough on crime is one thing, but being tough on the causes of crime is another. You need both to nip the problem in the bud."

61762,"Reply to #61703:


Hey there, I'm the original OP again. This will be my last reply and clarification for this whole debate.


Much of your retaliation comes from a student's perspective where grades matter and hard work deserves to be recognized. If you continue to think that way, that the world owes your for being hardworking and smart, that every company need to appreciate every interviewee's hard work during their school days, then I think you need some proper real life counselling. 

You are smart? Good for you. You are from the Ivy League? Good for you. Everyone will recognize that you are a smart kid who excelled in school. Grades are important to climbing the academic ladder, no doubt. Did I ever strung in the way where I downplay in excelling academically? No!

The root of my argument has and always as been the same. That being academically elite in your studies is not a representation of how capable you are in your future workplace. 

Firstly, I do not condone your statements : 

""like it or not grades ARE A REFLECTION of how intelligent you are (academically), the ability to retain knowledge and to a certain extent how hard you studied.""

and 

""As mentioned by many of you, ""no one cares about your results or where you came from, only how much you can bring to the table.""

Grades are only a reflection of how intelligent of how you are to a certain extend. You are going through an academic process where knowledge is pumped into your brain and you're expected to regurgitate everything you know into a 2 hour paper. 1 week after the paper you can't even remember some of the basics. I've been through that so don't bullshit me.

Boy/girl, I'm not running a charity over. I'm running a business where we have to constantly pit out talents, knowledge and ideas against our competitors, whether local or overseas. To excel academically is the basic criteria you need to even consider before entering any company. Who wants to hire a CAP 2.0 fellow? I'm sorry if I hurt your pudding emotion but this is a very realistic world. You want to apply for a degree holder position then you need to be a jolly good one. I would choose a CAP 5.0 fellow over a 1.5 fellow any day.

This addresses the need for academic results for applying a position in a company before the HR even starts reading into details about your resume.

Next comes the interview(s) where we would actually talk and understand how capable this prospective employee actually is. If we smell some bullshit, then obviously even if you are CAP 5.0, I would reserve my acceptance.

If you managed to smoked through your interview and land in my company then your probation period starts. 3 or 6 months, that is the standard. This is where you are really tested on how capable you are.

If you are good, then I'm glad I hired you as my employee and enabling you to grow professionally. If you are struggling but still have a very strong learning capability and character which I deem you can be groomed, you are hired. But if you cannot perform and through repeated meetings and counselling sessions on what is hindering you at work and you still can't improve, I don't give a hoot if you are a CAP 5.0 or not, out you go.

Smart student? Good for you. If you want a job here, then show me the results.

Secondly, I do not condone your statements again : 

""To say that grades are not important in the future, would just be a lie and give students in their impressionable pre-teen and even JC students the false impression that ""I don't need to work hard since it doesn't matter in the long term"".

Your argument is simply invalid and is a straw man fallacy. If you're taking it personally and refuse to take it as an adult who is soon entering the harsh workforce smiling at you, refer to my reply above.

Thirdly, I do not condone your statements, again and again : 

""While this may be true in hindsight, it is not right to discourage or mock those who have done well, telling them that no one cares about their results. After all, most of them worked hard for their grades, so shouldn't we celebrate their achievements with them?"" 

Your emotion is taking over you as you type as an unjust teenager.

I did not discourage or mock those who have done well. You shouldn't take things out of context into your own form of imagination. Any students who successfully passed or graduated, I'm happy for them. Anyone would be proud of anybody who graduated because it means we have successfully instilled knowledge into the young minds enabling them to create a better future. Sound cliche I know. 

On a personal level, I am genuinely glad about it and I celebrate these achievements.

But on a professional level, graduation is but a stage where you have proved yourself to be academically capable. Thousands of young adults goes through that stage every year. Hundreds of academically capable students apply for positions in my company every year. Am I supposed to connect to them on a personally level and share their pain and struggles? No! I expect your to show me the skills and knowledge you have to scale my business further. It is not a charity organisation here. 


Fourthly (Seriously?), I do not condone your statements, again and again and again: 

""Lastly, just cause a few of us are ""arrogant"" and think of people who did not do as well as inferior, does not mean that all of us fall into that same category. How would you like it if I said all the people in low-demand courses ""lazy"" or ""stupid"". You wouldn't like it, just like how the people in better courses don't want to be universally classified under the arrogant category. ""


Honestly I do not understand where did you get that from. I wrote from a neutral POV where both degrees are equally good in their aspect and what matters is whether they can offer their skills and knowledge from their textbooks into their work. Neither did I even attempted to generalize a perception that BEng students are universally arrogant.

Read: skills and knowledge from their textbooks into their work.

If you cannot offer despite coming from NUS and scoring a CAP 5.0, then you are not valued at all to the company.

So, what do you mean by ""just like how the people in better courses don't want to be universally classified under the arrogant category."". 

Did I see the word ""better""? You just slapped yourself in the face right there.


My series of post was to shed some light onto BTech and some motivation and wow, I managed to shed some light on how you should prepare yourself mentally for the working world today.


On an ending note, I hope you students stop harping on how you deserved to be recognized just because you did great academically.

Remember that meritocracy is the crux of our elitism issue today in Singapore. Meritocracy works to a certain extend and goes by stages (School, Work). Meritocracy in your company does not follow how well you did when you're in school years ago. You do not demand a promotion by reasoning that you score a CAP 5.0 despite showing a lousy performance record in your company.

Trust me, when you immerse yourself in the workforce years later you would understand where I'm coming from.

Peace out , indefinitely. "

61754,"Definitely not a whisper but more to spread awareness. Those who have seen the story spreading on insta/media platforms, lets not allow this kind of things to be swept under the rug. 

A guy was made to write a mere apology letter to his victim (if you have seen it its extremely unapologetic and still makes it about himself). On top of that he was given a 12-month conditional warning (aka he will only be punished if he recommits the offense) for filming a girl showering. This happened in one of the halls near to FASS.

NUS even told the victim that the private punishment was severe enough already (who judges?). They also told the victim to keep quiet about this case. The police said they cannot do anything unless the case gets bigger. It feels like those public campaigns on privacy invasion are just lip service. The school is protecting itself and thus the perpetrator at the expense of the victim. 

The girl feels that the punishment is too lenient. About a year ago, an NTU guy was given 4 weeks jail time for secretly filming other guys in the shower.

In the guy’s defense, he was drunk while he was doing it, and he got a really good future ahead to be marred by such things.

Thoughts? Extremely frustrated to know that this kind of shit goes down and is being swept under the carpet. Not the first time this kinds of story have been heard. Last year around this time, a similar incident happened in one of the halls as well, the one near to business school. The school also swept it under the rug and tried not to create too much negative attention. 

It is extremely disconcerting to know that nothing is really being done and that the consequences of such behavior is met with a light tap on the wrist. "

People seem to have the compulsion to make it a point to compare themselves against you, and in the way to reaffirm themselves. 

Even in NUS, you can't even say that you did well for a module or scored anything above A- without getting dirty looks from others. I'm not talking about people bragging in other's faces about their A-grades, but the kind where your friend casually asks you ""how did you do for XXXXX last semester?"", then immediately scowls openly when you tell them you get an A. Quite evidently they weren't asking out of interest or curiosity. It seems to me that achievement is actually frowned upon, unless it's your own! 

In the workplace you have the inexplicable discussion of ""how long I have not taken MC"" the moment someone goes on MC, where it becomes a flexfest of who has managed to suck up to middle management the best at the expense of everyone else due to presenteeism, which is another topic in its own right. Employees who stay behind later and later at night just because they want to be the last person to leave, which ends up being a staredown between the last two members, each waiting for the other to leave, just so they can claim they were the last person to leave, which somehow translates to them being ""hardworking and productive""...?"

61723,"There's a curious trend of students, mostly girls, getting 'trendy' tattoos such as faces of wolves, maybe some flowers, birds, anchors or 'meaningful' words. Just fyi, getting these generic tattoos don't make you cool, it makes you a generic tryhard. Trying to be different by getting a wolf tattoo to show that you are an independent, strong and cool? Nope! Sad to say, you're just unoriginal and generic. It seems that it is the usual attention seeking girls that gets these tattoos, y'know, the ones that laughs really loudly and claps whenever they laugh. To freshies who are just entering uni, it is easy to succumb to the need to stand out and be a 'cool' person in uni, especially when you're in hall. But think twice before getting a thrashy and random tattoo. A wolf tattoo might make u look cool for a day, but it makes u unoriginal and thrashy your entire life. 'What if there is a meaning to my tattoos?', one might ask. The problem is many don't have a legit reason for getting a tattoo. Many end up trying too hard to justify their tattoos, to the point that it seems pathetic. 'I got through a tough breakup, my wolf/ anchor tattoo is to show that i am strong!' Come on man, it just shows that you're not a person that thinks things through. I'm thinking that many girls with these random generic tattoos are regretting it right now even though they don't show it. So freshies, you can clap and laugh loud and dramatically to show your keeness and support in a topic to get attention, but think twice about getting a useless tattoo because you will most definitely regret it. Once you leave uni and begin work life, you will look back at these now irrelevant girls with those random thrashy tattoos and think to yourself, 'Phew! I'm so glad i ain't them!'"
61721,"I add my two cents worth to the btech/Beng debate. 

If u are honest with itself, Most of the work we engineers do doesn't need the knowledge we acquire from university.
 
Some work exp and common sense is all that is needed.

Beng itself is too complicated and academic. Btech while watered down is also not necessary for real life work.

The whole purpose of btech and Beng are just a piece of paper to get you a job.

So who cares whether it is a degree mill, btech, or Beng?

However the paradox is while actual work doesn't need the degree knowledge. HR and boss wants that piece of paper. As long as HR thinks Beng is better than Btech which is better than degree mill, then the value of Beng is there.

But honestly the truth is there is no difference in actual work performance between the three, coz the knowledge acquired is really not necessary.

We are slaves of HR and the society.
Same thing with PhD.

61720,"Hi, I was one of the very lonely, consistently feeling down person but as the sem ends, I wanna share some happy things.

1) I joined a CCA. although I suck so hard at it but I feel I'm learning something and I'm happy to have people around me, although we are not close yet but I'm very blessed to help had all the help from them

2) I'm very happy now I have a friend whom I can regularly exercise with in school

3) I've always been passive and shy and I always stutter and have difficulty expressing myself. Very blessed to have met this person who took initiative to talk to me rather than just work itself

4) I feel a lot happier these days, even though my grades are expected to slump :) Although I'm still that phantom in school and by myself all the time, at least I have some company and have had people reach out to me. Like I really can't thank you enough again and again.

Have some questions:

1) how do i talk to people and try to be closer to them? I've always stuttered while trying to say something. I'm also kinda afraid of being a nuance to people around me and I don't really know how to start a conversation without making other people feel uncomfortable

2) i would like some advice to already working people / employers, what are things to have in application of a job or in the working world? what would like to see in us? i've been told to ask myself what can i bring for others, but i've been so mediocre and passive i usually just follow orders and finish what im assigned to.

Thank you and I hope everyone does better too."
61716,honestly just feeling so drained from this relationship. i've an extremely selfish partner who likes things to go his way. he doesn't care. he likes to think that he cares. he doesn't watch after my safety. he doesn't act like a damn guy in a relationship. he doesn't put in concrete effort / acts to show that he cares. after finals will be the right time to break up.

I know what I want to achieve, like a particular role A that I want to be promoted to in the future. Definitely don't want to be stuck in an executive position and doing the same routine things forever right? I want to take more initiative and do more work, but i don't know how to. Am I supposed to take initiative to reply to the emails directed to my colleagues in role A? Like ""steal"" their work? Just take and do? If i want to be in role A that means I need to learn how to do what they are doing right? That means taking the initiative to steal their job scope? "

However, I've heard from other students, with similar background and experiences, who recently got offered the same role in the same company and that they are getting paid 15% more than me. Most of them, however, had counter offers that they utilised during the negotiation process. I really love my job scope but it sucks knowing how much more they're going to get paid while doing the same kind of job as me. Do you think its acceptable to re-negotiate your salary after signing the contract and how do I go about doing so?"

61703,"This is the admin of #61703 replying to Mr. BTech who is ""not replying indefinitely"".

If you still do not see the point that I am putting across, assuming that I am a ""emotional teenager"", perhaps your inability to comprehend my argument is the exact reason you spur us on by saying ""grades are not important"".

Old man, our studies do not simply comprise of ""regurgitat(ing) knowledge"". Granted, everybody knows the knowledge you learn in school, regardless of level might not be used for your future job or even tertiary education. The chemistry knowledge I learnt in JC definitely isn't fully applicable to the course I'm studying now. What the education system does succeed in however, is fulfilling the purpose of nurturing critical thinkers. The questions I tacked in A Levels set the foundations on how I should study, problems which come out of it and how I should solve it. Just like in uni, where a firm grasp of knowledge on my major would be a good indication that I can critically think in the field and perhaps contribute to the firm I join. 

More importantly, thank you to #61802 for your insight on the topic. I guess it does take a real life example to show people the reality of the situation, and I wish you all the best in your future career. Bottom line, grades do matter for most jobs as the first point of selection. What comes next (e.g. attitude and ability to work in a firm) will be judged AFTER grades were looked at. Typically, the people who say ""grades don't matter"" either really don't need them cos they are secure in their future, or are just trying to throw you off to study less for the bell curve.

A lot of you have commented (esp the guy who said something along the lines of it depends on what you do). I do acknowledge your point, and I did think about it. You are right by saying that everybody has different aspirations. After all, we cannot have a society full of doctors, just like how we cannot have one full of poets. But that brings me to the point I brought up in my original post. However, what mommy told me at the end of the day makes perfect sense; ""it doesn't matter how well you do, as long as you tried your best"". I admit that maybe me and the other guy might have made results sound like a means to an end. Thats not true, we are just saying that the notion of grades not being important is utter rubbish. At the end of the day however, there will always be people who do better than others. To the people who aren't doing well, as long as they have done their best, thats all that matters. To tell them however, that grades aren't important before they have even tried could lull them into a false sense of insecurity. Instead, EVEN IF WE KNOW that they are not at the top of their class, we should still encourage them to work hard, and the end product does not matter as long as they tried their best.

It might seem confusing but let me summarise my argument. 
(1) Grades do matter, I'm sorry but this reality will be here for a long time. 
(2) Grades are not means to an end. TRY YOUR BEST in whatever you do, thats what is important. If your aim is to be a world-class farmer, take a course related to it (hypothetically), and WORK HARD AT IT.

61701,"We started dating one year ago when we both knew you have plans to go for further studies overseas. During this one year, I got to know you and really fell for you. Times spent dating you were the happiest moments of my life.  I do not say it enough, but it always felt like you were the missing part that I have been searching for all these while. Unsurprisingly, I fear the inevitable and often held hopes that you will change your plans and not pursue these plans. I was even slightly happy when you told me that your GMAT scores were not good and may not get you into a good school (yes I know that's selfish). 

Fast forward today, you have accepted a scholarship offer to pursue a 2 years Masters degree in the US. As much as I inherently do not believe in it, I had offered to give LDR a try. I started talking about how I will plan my work ALs to visit you; about how we should start making video calls a habit in our relationship. Not easy, but I thought we agreed...  However, yesterday you suddenly changed your mind and told me that you do not want to make the commitment of coming back after your Master's degree. You also do not want to bear the guilt and obligations of making me wait. I was unable to change your mind.

I guess I am not good enough. I guess we were not meant to be. "
