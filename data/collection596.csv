59699,"hey #59651, just like you, 
I went through the hoe phase a few years ago. After I lost my mom to an accident, my world fell apart and I felt like a part of me died and I didn't deserve to feel happy anymore. I also had a long-time bf but at that point of time, he was really busy with work. 

I often felt empty and isolated. I then left him for another guy who turned out to be emotionally abusive and the relationship left me with nothing but tears and disappointment. I started partying every weekend and had a few fwbs to numb the pain. Eventually I got tired of everything and decided to end my partying ways. 

I then focused on rebuilding my relationship with my friends and family whom I had neglected and it gave me a new sense of belonging. I also started doing volunteering work to give my life a new purpose. I then met someone through volunteering.

I began to see a future with him and so I decided to get myself tested and it came back clean. I decided to confess to him about my past and sadly, he started to see me in a different light and so we slowly drifted apart. I don't blame him because afterall, he's a very eligible guy who deserved someone better. 

Honestly, I have no regrets in life and I think you shouldn't have any regrets too. Why? Because there's no point in having regrets. As cliche as it sounds, everything happens for a reason. 

After I broke up with my then bf, I met my abusive ex. Because of that, I learned to appreciate my friends and family more. My friends then introduced me to volunteering where I made many like-minded friends and developed a new purpose in life. 

If I hadn't partied so hard, I wouldn't have realised that drinking and partying can never truly take away the pain in me and that they are just temporary solutions. 

Don't regret. Don't look back. You have paid the price for your bad decisions and you have learned your mistakes. You have grown wiser and stronger because of the pain you have been through. Love yourself. Forgive yourself.

Yet.. I still hope that you would have been together with me... I can't let these feelings go away, especially not when I'm seeing you everyday."
59696,"seeing that the ""smart/nerd girl"" thing has blown up, i think people could also consider that not every relationship has to look like the kind with standard gender roles and dynamic that we (as society, and also as the NUSWhispers community) are used to. it's definitely also worthwhile seeking a partner to be your source of comfort, friendship, support, and advice, apart from love and the frills (gifts, dates, sex) that come with a relationship.

59695,"Just a curious question - Why do the printers in soc prints the first page of printing summary? IMHO it can be more cost-saving and environmental if the summary is emailed to the student account instead. Maybe for printing jobs with say > 15-20 pages, then print the details page since it also kinda act as a divider? Idk just a random thought.."

59690,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to use this platform to gain some relationship advice. I've been in a relationship for close to 3 years now, and I'm wondering... Does your other half ever end up changing his/her bad habits for your sake despite you repeatedly talking to him/her about it? These bad habits are ones that I feel like it's really tough for me to tolerate and despite talking to him about it, arguing with him about it, he is perpetually telling me ""I understand"", but nothing ever seems to change. It got me thinking, could I be expecting too much out of him? 

These bad habits include: 
• Firstly, his lack of effort in interacting with my parents when he comes over to my place. He simply says hi to both of them, showers, then stays in my room the whole day. Or when my parents fetches him home, he doesn't even bother to make small talk with them in the car... And for me, I feel like that is quite disrespectful. I think being an ''introvert'' is not an excuse at all, because I also do make an effort to make small talk with his parents, buy food for his parents when I go over to his place. So for me, I can't quite understand why he just can't do the same for me.
• Secondly, we are taking a few classes together so naturally, we decided to be in the same project groups. However, he hasn't been doing much work at all for these projects that we are together, just physically appearing for meetings while he focuses his time on projects from other modules. I am also taking other modules in this semester, but I still believe in doing my best for all projects across all modules. Honestly, I'm just perplexed as to why he thinks that by doing projects with me, it gives him the leeway to relax and focus his time on projects for other modules... 
• Thirdly, his actions constantly contradicts what he tells me. Every now and then, he likes to tell me that a relationship is all about giving 100% from both parties, and that he truly loves me a lot. Yet, he also expects me to just throw aside whatever I feel (such as stress from the semester) to be there for him, throw aside whatever work I have to help him with his work and so on. I feel that I have been just giving, and not receiving at all throughout this relationship. I know it's an unhealthy mindset to have but at the same time, I can't just keep giving but not receiving because when I talk to him now, I feel so exhausted and drained. I used to look forward to his text messages but not anymore.

And to be honest, I am just touching the tip of the iceberg with these few bad habits which I feel like I can't tolerate (anyone feel me?). Other things include how he's always tardy with repaying me (the money just accumulates), his inability to understand my frustration (oh I've tried scolding, talking nicely, discussing.. None works - he just tells me he understands and proceeds to do the exact same mistake the next week) and so on. I feel really drained, and at this point in time I'm just wondering if I should just end the relationship. It would be great if you can share with me your advice, thanks everyone!

59688,"I had a very serious crush on my jc classmate for a few years. In those few years no other man existed in my eyes. But the phase is over because I kind of let him know how I feel about him but he did not respond. So I accepted the rejection and I have decided to move on. However, moving on is not as easy as I thought it would be. 
I have liked around 4 guys in this past 2 years. But none of the crushes are as serious as the jc one. The reason I like those guys is usually because they reminded me of my jc crush... 
Subconsciously I will compare all my crushes with my jc crush and I find it really ridiculous since I have already told myself to give up. 
I realize I couldn’t like anyone seriously anymore. At most I find the person cute and nice and that’s about it. I couldn’t like him with the same intensity as I liked my jc crush. And the feeling is really fleeting like I can like for a few days and simply forget about this feeling.
It is like as though I just like someone for the sake of liking someone. 
I am worried that if I can never like anyone else the same way as i have liked the jc crush... "

59686,"What do you guys think about PDA? Where exactly would you draw the line between what's acceptable and what's not?

Obviously my partner and I don't go into full-blown kisses on trains and whatnot, but what about, say, hugs? I feel like Singapore's pretty divided on this...some don't like to see anything other than hand holding, others don't give a shit even about long kisses"
59684,"Dear #59684, unlike those people who commented on your post, I'm not here to judge or condemn you. 

You mentioned that you have a gf and got on tinder recently. Have you thought about why you did this? Is it because you were bored or you were trying to find someone new? If you were just bored, you can try to develop new interests and hobbies. If you were looking for a potential partner, you could first evaluate your current relationship i.e. are you happy with your current partner? do you see a future with her? If you're happy and do envision a future with her, I would advise you to stop talking to that new girl before it starts to affect your relationship with your current partner.  

Yes, that new girl may seem very interesting to you. But that could be due to the very fact that you have known her for only 2 weeks. You mentioned that you're not sure if you like her or are infatuated with her. I think it's very easy to 'like' someone, especially if that person is nice and attractive. Based on my own experience, I think infatuations usually don't last. They are merely feelings that fade away as time passes. Afterall, as humans, we are often drawn to new things and then lose interest as the 'newness' wears off.

It's also easy to feel like you've known someone for a long time if you two share a lot of similarities. To be honest, I've met a lot of people whom I felt a great sense of closeness towards because we shared the same thinking and values. Although it certainly felt good to meet such people, it doesn't mean we would be compatible in the long run. 

You also mentioned that you got physical with that new girl but didn't move onto the bed. Are you trying to say you have not cheated? Everyone has a different definition when it comes to cheating. Some people may feel that cheating means seeing two person at the same time. Some may feel that cheating means having sex with someone other than your sexual partner. It doesn't matter what other people think. It doesn't matter what your definition is. Most importantly, you have to ask yourself if you want to continue to stay in your current relationship. 

The length of a relationship may not be the best gauge of the quality of a relationship. But I think 5 years is quite a good amount of time to get to know someone well. Throughout these 5 years, I'm sure there were ups and downs and you should be able to see if you partner would be a good match in the long run. If you don't see her as a good match, you should end things with her as soon as you can. Then you can take your time to get to know the new girl before taking it to the next level. All the best.

59679,"I wonder since when have I began to close off my heart to everyone. I'm introverted, but I can socialize with those whom I feel comfortable with, and I can feel that they're comfortable talking to me too. However, those are just passing-by acquaintances. I cannot really connect to anyone. I even tried and managed to get myself into a clique before, but due to lack of common interests and common opinions on some things, I just gradually drifted apart and I could feel that I didn't really want to be there (I'm completely one of those typical otakus). But I was lonely. 
Here I am, alone again as I have always been for the last 24 years. No true close friends, but several acquaintances. I had some crushes, but they remain crushes because I saw no point in confessing.

59677,"This is not a troll post.
Hey #59677 , this is coming from a guy whos going for exchange soon. I also have a girl which I like but I honestly don't think I'll tell her about it before I leave. Chances are that you are probably not the same girl I have in mind, but just let me pretend as if you were her.

I really like you too, to the point that receiving wa messages from you will make my entire day. But I probably won't be confessing to you in person. Cos while I know that we are close, I don't know what you think of me. Am I special to you? Or am I just another one of your close guy friend, like the other one you often hang out with? 

I had a close friend which I liked back in JC as well. But when I confessed to her, things didnt turn out well and I lost her even as a friend. Because of this I am still afraid to confess to you because I'm afraid to lose the status quo. If anything, I dont mind being your friend for a little longer.

I wish we could get even closer, find more excuses to hang out together, so I can know for sure that you are interested in me as I am in you, especially in the upcoming sem break before I leave for SEP. Once I establish that we are mutually interested in each other. I will definitely confess to you. If not, I'll probably keep my feelings to myself.

But truth be told is it tiring. I've had times where I just wait things out, continue doing my own things lest I be dragged in. Sure, maybe I'm not the best friend out there but we all have our lives too heh. And at times it gets so tiring that I just want to rant, and I get so annoyed.

While I know life for you is hard, all of us out here have our own problems too. I can only offer you so much help. If you can't even be bothered to TRY and do something to help yourself, then what do you expect me to? Fcking hell.

59669,"I broke up with my girlfriend after a long relationship, and I suddenly realized I had no friends. I spent most of the time with my gf and said ""no"" to others. There was a group I used to be a part of, but they've moved out and stopped inviting me to join their gatherings (understandably). I went to their place sometimes and ended up studying instead, things were just not the same. 

At day, I study hard and feel alright. I'm happy about my grades and excited about what I'm studying. But at night, I terribly crave for human interactions. I go to the gym, eat, watch Korean dramas to numb these feelings and exhaust myself so that I can sleep. I just don't know how long I can last this way.

I made bad life choices and didn't appreciate my friends while they were around. I also can't rely on my family as parents keep arguing with each other. I don't want to go home. I've tried attending events in my interests, talking about personal stuff with project mates, and introducing myself to people who sit alone in lectures. There was no awkward silence, the conversation flowed, but I found it hard to ask them out after that. I'm not sure if they need a new companionship as I do. It's also too late to sign up for any new sports clubs or interest groups, and there are another 5 months to the next semester.

59654,"It's not mother's day yet but i realised that ladies esp mothers shld be appreciated more.

I really appreciate my mom. Why? This is because she carried the infant me in her belly for 9 months. And every mom did the same for everyone who is reading this post.

You see, she carries you for 9 months, she may have to sacrifice her full time job to take care of you, and let her body to rest etc (There's a long list). The sacrifices they have made is really tremendous & very Respectful.

Besides sacrificing, there are so much emotional swings & insecurities they face. Sadly, there are some moms who are left to take care of their infant alone (as boyfriend/hubby doesn't want to take responsibility)

I grew up with both of my parents often in long cold wars. Like can last up to 6 months or longer. prob 8 months. And every time they argue, i got frightened. (In some cases, couples may be violent to each other too)

Over the years, if your mom chose to be the homemaker, she has really done alot of stuff (ie. cooking, cleaning up, washing, ironing, marketing etc etc).

Tbh, i've never learnt how to wash my clothes/hang my clothes to dry etc.. i just feel indebted to her. I'm alrdy 22. Yes, it's time for me to learn and take on more responsibility. 

Right now, she's almost retiring from her part time job, and I hope can be more responsible for her and myself and take care of her when she is in her golden years. I know money can't buy everything (i.e i bought birdnest on bdays etc) I need to be obedient and responsible so that she doesnt need to worry about me anymore (they showed so much concern when you were a baby till now..)

Which is why some people say, find your partner who shares similar traits to your mom. Because of her sacrifices, her effort to love you, her constant worry etc have made you who you are today. Just like how your partner can potentially change you for the better. Someone who will always be there for you.

The way my dad ""treated"" my mom in the past was really harsh that I shed tears on certain arguments. And i really wanted to protect my mom at that time but i couldn't because i was just a child. Hence, growing up i promised to protect her. 

Ps. my parents are more loving now, cold wars don't happen so frequent now, once in awhile and it lasts at most 1 week? I'm kinda glad. 

I promised myself, that if i were to find a partner, i make sure that i love her wholeheartedly. Besides giving her a comfortable life, but also to appreciate her. 

I hope that this post would justify on why i think mothers shld be appreciated more. And guys shld treat their girlfriend better, because can you imagine they will go through so much in their life, longer than the 2 years we served. I promised myself, never let my future girlfriend  to go through this situation.

Thank you for reading.

59648,"Just my take on the whole ""smart girls, sexist guys"" issue- I don't see why there is such a gendered divide with how the issue is discussed. 

I have been in both male-dominated environments and female-dominated environments. I would agree that there are some guys who are very charismatic and overconfident, and there are rarely girls who act that confident. And as for the people who treat girls too gently, possibly by way of underestimation, those are  usually guys as well. 

But I find other girls just as scary. Girls may not underestimate your book smarts, but they can get jealous and paranoid of it. They can backstab you as well as a guy can, maybe even better, because all the while they will sing praises of how smart and how useful you are. They can drive a group project off the cliff, just as well as guys can. They too can say a lot about nothing, and even if they arent as charismatic and confident, they may be hugely popular by other means. They can exclude and ostracise you, perhaps even in ways that most guys dont know how to-- and they may do that because they are afraid of your book smarts. 

Maybe they are afraid you will give them a bad peer evaluation because they arent as smart with academics. Maybe they think you are one more data point on the bell curve, stopping them from getting their FCH. Maybe all this isn't even about your grades or your intelligence, they just don't like you. Rest assured they will never tell you why. I am as afraid of sexist guys as I am of these mysterious girls. 

A sexist guy might give you the easy part of the project, because he thinks you cant do anything more-- he thinks you're dumb. A scheming girl gives you the easy part, because she wants to trash you in the peer evaluation for being lazy and not contributing as much, and talking up her harder portion instead. She thinks you're book smart, and that might mean you are done for."

2. but when it comes to deeper relationship topic, or sexual/hookup topic, European women tend to be more conservative on non-european and less likely open the opportunity to Asian guy. They also prefer to stick with people from their own country (so this trend is NOT just for PRC!)

So for those who have been in a relationship/ hookup with European/Caucasian/American, what do you (man/woman) think?

59632,It seems to me that almost all pretty girls are dao and have a sense of self entitlement. Am I correct to say that? I would very much like to believe that maybe only those that I meet so far are. I would love to meet one who is not and is appreciative.
59631,"I read some posts about someone pitying herself not having closed friends, but maybe some people are not meant to have closed friends. I grew up without any closed friend and my sibling often teased me for that. A few months ago, I initiated a conversation with a quite guy at a social event, after that he expressed interest to befriend me. We came quite close but after a while, I started to find the friendship irritating. When I decided to end the friendship, he suffered emotional breakdown. After this incidence, I realized not everyone is meant to have closed friends. "
59630,"Hi all, this is mostly for computing people/ those familiar with programming.

So, the problem is that I overthink a lot, and I think it really shows in my code. For some reason I just tend to go a roundabout way to get the same result as everyone else and (e.g. if others have about 10-20 lines, I'll have about 20-30 lines). This also means my code is not elegant and readability is compromised. Idk how to fix this problem of mine and don't really know any platforms to share my concern on. ):

I would really appreciate any advice or help given thanks a lot!"
59629,I am thinking what do single girls look out for in a guy? What exactly make them to want to give you a chance to talk further?
59628,"I've just got one piece of advice to people find it hard to get dates: Please learn some self grooming. Despite what people like to say, it is a fact that looks and appearances are very important factors that contribute to others' impressions of you. 

Proper self grooming shows others that, at the very least, you care about yourself enough to put in the effort to look good in front of others. If you are not even interested in taking care of yourself, how do you expect others to take an interest in you?"
59627,"Regarding those who mentioned about dating same age or younger, I am a lady, dating a guy 5 years younger than me (he is in early 20s and im im late 20s). 

I was really skeptical about it because the age difference is really too huge, felt like im gonna baby sit him. Also partly because i have dated same age and one year younger who are super immature when it comes to dating. But I was wrong, age is just a number. I guess it's the experiences we went through in our lives respectively that can allow us to be connected. If i were to date someone older but has been a prince the whole life who cant eat kopitiam food, does it mean that the relationship will turn out to be better? No. Thats why, age really doesnt matter. 

So we have been dating for 3 years and my pay is at least 2 times of his. He never knew and he never asked. He mentioned that it doesnt change the way he gonna love and dote on me even if I receive better education than him or receiving higher pay than him. He still wants to pay for small little things when we are out, and i would do vice versa. We dont argue about money. 

I was so afraid that someone younger and prettier may appear and cause the downfall of the relationship, but i literally think too much because he was also afraid someone handsome and more mature appear would take me away from him. We reassured each other from time to time to keep our relationship strong. 

To be honest, ever since we started dating, i actually forgotten that he is younger than me. All i know is im in love with someone i want to spend my life with, and nothijg else matters anymore. 

We both invested our time and effort in something and someone we know its gonna last for life. 

So now, he has popped the question during our 3rd year anniversary and we are looking at a simple wedding will do. 

Before meeting him, i always tell everyone i will never date someone younger, but i guess life is making me a fool for being too sure about something uncertain - the future. 

Good luck for those with 姐弟戀! "
59625,Should friendship happen normally? Lets say there is an acquaintance who I dont see regularly. Would it be weird if I ask him if he would like to be friends?
59624,"Why are all my lecturers so damn secretive about how much % of final grade each CA/test/practical makes up? First, they don't put it up publicly. Then when you take the initiative to ask all they say is either ""not confirmed"", ""not much"" or ""can't disclose"". "
59623,PGPR please revise your regulations regarding the early closure of study rooms. It really affects alot of students. 
59622,How should I try to be friends with someone who already have a clique? He always hang out with his clique and I dont know how to talk to him since he is always with his friends whom I dont know:(
59621,I'm a Y2 about to graduate from an RC and looking to stay in one of the halls or PGPR next sem. I didn't join any clubs or CCAs outside of my RC. Do I realistically have any chance of joining a hall? Or is PGPR the only place where I'll be likely to get a spot?
59620,"I am the OP of #59574 on going on a shopping spree for tech stuff.
These are my response to the comments as of 6pm 5 March
Dji osmo pocket if you’re more serious about vlogging:)->Thinking of tech vlog, not really those walking outside vlogs

Is okay I also spend about S$1k in Taobao this morning.->Ok what did you spend it on

Rent one instead->Rent which one?

Nah, photography is for losers. Can’t you find a better hobby.->Was planning to use the camera for video recording.

Dont listen to people who say ""Money cant buy happiness"" ???? Everybody has/needs a hobby->That is why I am asking about this.

If you’re looking for affirmation here it is. Yes.->Not helpful, but ok

Buy stuff that you will use frequently, don't buy those that you use once in a while.-> I could argue that I would use those items at least once a week, would that be frequent enough?

1. Will you bring around a tripod when you are out->More for stabilizing my phone if I shoot video at home while using a device for example
2. A phone camera can easily double up as a digital camera in the $400 price range ->If want to do a tech vlog start small with phone camera then?
3. Keyboard and mouse can buy if you intend to use them daily->Ok then
4. I don't see a need for a SIM router->Because I have a 2GB/day data plan and bringing another phone around means the need to carry a power bank just in case.
5. Might be a need if you own the new MBP. I suggest looking on carousell for much cheaper type C hubs. I got mine for $49->May consider, but it is not for an MBP.
6. Might be a need if you are short on storage->More for backup purposes

Rule of thumb: if you wait for 1-2 months, you might feel that you no longer need the item. After waiting, if you still feel that these items will really aid your productivity, then get it!->1TB HDD been thinking about it since February,SIM router since end of winter vacation, camera and tripod since winter break,Type C adapter since January.

Buy everything from carousell. If you happen to not like it or need it, you can relist them on carousell and get back most of the money.->IT Fair this weekend though

Unless you intend to get an interchangeable lens camera it's difficult to justify getting a camera when your phone camera provide most of the functionality plus easier share options/->So just use the phone camera for shooting video first then?"
59617,"So, I live in an RC and was going to the pantry which was on the female floor. While walking through the hallway, I passed this girl's room. And to my shock, she was sitting in front of her computer, completely topless and wearing shorts that are as short as my FBTs. Like come on, I know this is a female floor, but the pantry is on this floor and you know very well that guys will also be walking by. I don't care what you do in your room. But if you want to leave the door open, at least have the decency to wear a t-shirt, or wear longer shorts. 

As a guy, I'm sure other guys will also be shocked or disgusted by you. You know who you are, and if you're still doing this, I'll report you to OHS or campus security.
"
59612,"You are going for exchange really soon.

I was elated when you got your dream exchange location.

However at the same time, I felt a deep sadness inside me, I have had friends going overseas for long periods before, it never felt this way

For you, I felt happy and yet at the same time sadness.
Sad that I won't be seeing for for quite a while
Sad that I won't be able to see your beautiful smile. 
Sad that I won't be able to hear your rants. 
Happy 
That you are.. happy 

Not that we have been seeing other much anyways, after all we are just friends, but whenever we do meet, I feel comfortable around u, and happy, even though I may not show it.

I am going to cherish the time that I can catch you in school or during lessons.

I will never tell you this but I know I will miss you, and I think i fell for u..

I wish you all the best on your exchange! Have the best time in your life! Play hard and work hard, have fun and grow! 

I hope that we stay in contact although I highly doubt that given how popular u already are in school now.. 

After all.. 
We are just friends...
I'll be fine if u are happy.
So stay bubbly, always! 

That evergreen awkward guy"
59610,I’ve graduated about 5 years ago and have recently started dating this guy much younger than me (poly grad waiting for ns). I earn like your average 2 year+ grads. What worries me is that he doesn’t seem interested in planing for a future. He told me he plans to sign on after ns. Is that good? Bad? He comes from a decently ok family...
59609,"I graduated almost 2 years ago (science fac) and am currently earning a regular grad pay ~5k after Cpf ~4k. Was a very comfortable amount but my father recently got retrenched and I know it’s hard for him to ask me for cash so when he does I do give it to him. How do I cope because at this rate I’m almost giving him all of my pay (to pay off household stuff). My siblings are crap and they won’t help. I don’t have any outstanding tuition loans though, managed to pay them off but I’m just struggling right now trying to cope.  "

59603,"I just broke up from my first relationship, but it was a nice break up with mutual understanding that there’s seemingly no way we can both stay together. How do you normally deal with a break up? Is it normal to feel in denial and regret?(even though it still feels like i made the right choice)"
59600,I have been applying jobs that is related to my major. Wasn't going too well. Is there any other jobs that only requires a degree? I don't want to sign on.
