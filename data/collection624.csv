62495,Does anyone need a ride home from school next week at around 1030-11? For those staying around yck/amk/Thomson 
62490,"OP of #62490 here, the post with the 'unusable' G2(unless change ink).
1: I do not remember dropping it in recent memory. So I don't think dropping is the issue
2: Could it be correction tape/liquid paper?
3: No, this is not worth calling a townhall over. It would also need to be held in Japan,so not going to happen.
4: Suggestions for a good replacement please. Would like suggestions with a 0.5mm version."
62486,Thumbs up if you honestly don't give a shit about this peeping tom saga because finals more important. 
62485,"Hi I’m currently majoring in applied math. I would like to know, how useful would it be for me to pursue a minor in computer science?"
62483,"Ehh... So... I made a friend in the library. Well... I gave her cookies! And frankly speaking... Everytime I see her around I am usually rushing for something and I keep forgetting to get her number. I hope she sees this! Good luck for your finals!!! (On hindsight I should have like, left a note or something)"
62480,"OP of #62480 here, looked at the comments recently and realised actually, yes #62452 and I could literally be talking about the same person since it fits the description... and I'm beginning to be paranoid about it.

Thing is, his course isn't the smallest course there, so I'm just holding out hope that it's at least referring to another person in the cohort and not the same person???

That would be really awkward."
62476,"Attended Steven Halim's lecture, couldn't help but go OwO. But seeing confession #62476, I guess many people are feeling this way too. Any opinions on a Steven Halim fanclub? :3"
62470,"Quick qns, is it bad to be touchy and all after maybe 3 dates? Assuming you've been acquaintances/friends (cos ppl hv diff definitions) for at least a yr. 
Just curious how ppl view relationships these days/people's differing views in general "
62469,What do girls think of guys with a dad body? I suspect the reason I am not able to get a girlfriend is because I have a dad body. How can I get rid of my dad body? I play sports and can get gold for IPPT but still cannot rid myself of that beer belly and fats.
62466,How hire-able is an NUS CS degree with a CAP between 2 and 3?
62465,An exchange here and just finished two final exams a week before. I thought I acted really bad as I could only answer half of the questions in exams and not sure if my answers are correct. So I really afraid that I'll get an F... Is it OK for me to write e-mails to professor to ask if I fail?
62462,"Hi, just wanted to ask if anybody else here thinks DC/Marvel is just over-hyped? Like I’ve seen a few of their movies, but I’m not really a huge fan of them, I’m just like okay(?) they make for some good entertainment. Just wondering because it seems like everyone I know seems to be very invested in the DC/Marvel universe, and like especially when someone in my group of friends starts the ball rolling about the plot or so and so actor/actress in one of the movies, man the convo can go on for the next hour..."
62460,"With all the (supposed) girls from SoC coming out to say that you can't find a boyfriend in SoC, let me say that as a guy in SoC we have a simple rule of thumb when it comes to any girl we meet (assuming a heterosexual relationship):

If the girl is attractive in anyway to us, be it physically, emotionally, personality, and etc. she's probably attached so most decent guys won't make a move. This often rings true; most guys make this assumption unless told otherwise... Then prepare for an onslaught of sausages as the guys will stash their code and commit for you.

Else, the likely truth is that the girl is simply unattractive, batshit crazy, or a lesbian that has zero interest in guys, which is why no guy is making any advances. Minus the lesbian part, it's the same exact reasons as to why certain guys still can't get hitched or a date. 

The best first two steps to mitigate unattractiveness and get a partner in SoC and anywhere else on this planet:
1. Be attractive.
2. Don't be unattractive.

If you have already satisfied these 2 steps, then simply wait or start making some advancements on the guy/girl. Else, keep trying to make yourself attractive in some way.

Now, let the incoming salt from incels rain over this post."
62459,Since we’re talking abt gender ratio and all is biz gender ratio good? Is it true there are more girls than guys there??
62457,"Hey guys, would really like to know more about what do you guys think about the future of our hawkers in Singapore. Do you guys think that we are losing our hawker culture because more and more young Singaporeans do not want to venture into the F&B industry? Also, for those here, have you thought about starting a F&B business even with a degree from NUS? If so, what are the things stopping you from pursing those dreams.  "
62456,"I'm 32yo Guy and i like someone in my office but i haven't been in relationship for more than 6 years, but she is in a relationship recently. But in my heart i felt we have an connection but i already lost touch on how to approach someone i like, should i just stay away from it or should i tell her how i feel? I actually hate to jump into others people relationship as i felt i might hurt them, but what my friend told me is that her relationship that just started may not last as the BF is not living here locally and they know each other when she is at the origin of that guy country, so they don't really met each other much. I am very easily hurt but relations stuff for a guy as i got hurt last time in many ways, but i really do feel a connection with her just that she is currently in a new relationship. I need someone enlighten me and also possible tell me how i can approach someone even if this didn't work out, i really lost....."
62453,"OP of #61889 here. Just want to say thanks to the guy who commented on my post, Jonathan Choi. I’m only able to do 10% of what you said cos I really really suck at talking to girls. But it worked! Got myself a date for Endgame after exams! Thanks man! "

62451,"A guy that I was dating for 6 months invited me to his company’s incentive trip which he can bring a partner. We are not official during this time that he invited me to the trip. During the incentive trip he introduced me as his girlfriend to his colleagues from other regional office in his company. I was shocked as we are not official and he could have introduced me as a friend instead. Maybe he is trying to save face in front of his colleagues? Some of his colleagues even mistake me as his wife which made me awkward but of course I denied being his wife, just said that I am his girlfriend (playing along with him). Is he just trying to make use of me to be his arm candy? Or is he serious when introducing me as his girlfriend to his colleagues? My gut feeling tells me he is not serious about me (him always looking at his phone and I don’t feel loved), but I don’t understand his actions. Maybe I am really just an arm candy."

62447,"#62438: You're confusing double degree and double Major a bit there! If you do a double major, you only get one degree - i.e., a Bachelors in Something. Then, you take a second major consisting of about 48MCs (credits), which is on average 12~ modules. A single degree requires 160MCs which is taken over 8 semesters, so while you do need to overload for a few semesters, 48 extra MCs is (comparatively) doable. Compared to a double degree, I mean :)

A double degree is when you graduate with two Bachelors degrees (in most double degree programs, it's two Bachelors). So, if one degree needs 160MCs, you need to take double that. That's why people doing a double degree take 5 (or even 6) years to graduate and overload on most semesters. 

Last option is doing a minor. From what I recall, a minor is 24MCs. That means you need to do about 6 modules, which is completely doable since you have what are called unrestricted electives. A minor might not give you the expertise that a double degree or major has, but you can still explore different areas.

So I'm guessing that the number of credits required at SMU might be slightly different, but I believe they have a similar distinction between a double degree and major as well. "
62446,"Is it acceptable for a CS major to graduate with second lower? I get mixed views, some people say CAP matters and grades matter a lot but other people say that it doesn't matter because it all boils down to your technical skill as a programmer.

I have been getting a lot of depression and anxiety because of the over competitiveness and I can't get rid of all these feelings of stress, I feel like I'm going insane. It does not help that I have been clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression since JC started.

Don't get me wrong, I love my major and have had a genuine interest in programming since secondary school, and I'd never change my major for anything else. I just feel defeated, confused and anxious at this point in my life and I don't know what to do or think to make myself feel better. "
62442,"Everyone's chiming in on the MB saga now, but this isn't anything remotely related. 

May seem like a slightly naive question, but how does one know if they've met the right girl? In particular, I have two experiences I want to recount. 

I been talking to and meeting up with Girl A for a few months now. I've enjoyed our meetings, and I would say she sweeps me off my feet. Whenever we meet she'll have a lot of interesting stories to share. One could say she's my dream girl, but when I'm with her I don't really feel completely at ease if I'm to be honest. I always feel like I have to be on my guard, and the ""best"" version of myself.

Then there's Girl B. We've known each other for longer, and we have good banter. I feel so comfortable when I'm with her, like I can express myself freely and openly, and basically be my true self. I wouldn't say she sweeps me off my feet, but I would definitely consider her.

Is love supposed to be like things are with Girl A? Where you feel this sense of euphoria each time, but also feel constrained in your interactions with her? If I continue going out with Girl A, will this lack of feeling at ease get better, and will I eventually warm up to her and become more comfortable with spending time with her? Or is love closer to what I described with Girl B, someone who could be your best friend at the onset? Who you can be yourself around, but perhaps doesn't ignite in you the same sense of anticipation or euphoria as Girl A? "
62440,"I think amidst all the negativity surrounding recent issues, let me say something positive :) I am a history student in Dr Wang Jinping's Imperial Chinese History Module this semester and I absolutely adore her lessons. Her interesting take on how history should be taught and viewed inspired me to want to continue taking History as a Major. 

For example, every tutorial in the semester we look at history in a different way/source. One tutorial we did debates between confucian scholars and government officials, understanding the dynamic relationship between the clergy and the scholars. In another tutorial we looked at a famous scroll painting which depicted life in Tang China and examined how we can better understand history via these lenses. 

Her modes of assessments are also very interesting and contribute greatly to my understanding of the subject. For instance we have an Individual Passion Project that we are allowed to creatively (in whatever way we wish to) express our understanding. Ive seen some of my peers even do imperial chinese history memes for the project, some wrote poems, some even designed games and infographics! We also had a group project that forced us to work together to present a SKIT in class! Among all the group projects I had this semester I think this was the most fun preparing for and performing in!

The best part about Dr Wang is that she never fails to relate what we do (assessments, tutorials etc) to how we can better view, learn and appreciate history. Through her classes I not only better appreciate History, but also the pedagogical approaches to the teaching of the subject. I believe that all classes should be as fun as and as educational as hers! Fellow students past and present of Dr Wang's classes, what do you think?

p.s. yes, I have also submitted my module feedback to commend her on this."

62422,"Honestly wished more visitor lots can be allocated to CP1 to cater to SDE. Now all the lots near SDE are dedicated to staff parking and all visitor lots located at engineering. It would be nice if there could be a redistribution of visitor parking lots so that us poor architecture students dont have to park so far and lug our models/deliverables across schools (hilly terrain) or park indiscriminately whenever we need to transport our submissions.

62421,"Just my opinion, but is it just me, or do lecturers who teach technical or maths-heavy subjects tend to teach badly compared to lecturers of other subjects? I've never heard of FASS, medical or law students complaining about lecturers before but sure get a lot of complaints every time from comp science or engineering students. 

Maybe it's because of the subjects are obviously harder to teach and understand, but I also notice these lecturers tend to be those that care less about the students and don't put in as much effort.  "
62420,"From fellow art student here,

Don't try to find a bf from the medical lib. They always only date people within their own faculty or nursing peeps. And they have so little time as the years go by, so they never pay attention to us (from experience), even when dating. They only care about studying TBH."
62419,"OP of #62205: You probably won’t want to listen to me, but I still want to advise you that your best course of action is to break up with your boyfriend. I have an ex who’s like him as well, except that he wants me to have sex with other guys and watch. In the end, I just have to break up with him because what he wants - he has other fetishes as well - is just something that I cannot give him, and sex may not be everything about a relationship, but it’s one big part of it.   

I don’t want to use the word “pervert” to describe these kind of people, but there are guys (or even girls) out there who just have very weird sexual fetishes, and they are only going to become more and more extreme in their “preferences”. If you cannot accept and satisfy them, they are very likely going to cheat on you anyway because they are going to try to find someone else to satisfy them. Your boyfriend is very likely one of these people, and it’s almost impossible to change them. You end up having to change yourself to suit his tastes, and you are very likely going to be unhappy in the long run. I’ve been through it myself. 

Please make the best choice for yourself, not for your boyfriend, or you are going to waste your time in a relationship that won’t work out for you in the end.  "

62405,"To the OP of #62331

Do not be disheartened. I am somewhat like you. I do not have any material wealth to speak of. I come from an extremely humble background, my family were homeless for a few years even and we sought refuge under the roofs of relatives.

That being said, it wasn't all that bad. I mean, I'm here in Asia's best university aren't I? I somehow beat the odds but I had a lot of help along the way.

Also, I have been dating someone from a background that could not be more different than mine. She comes from an extremely wealthy family. And yet she chose me, someone who came from nothing.

She told me that she was attracted to me because of the fact that I am a person of strong character. Guess what? It was precisely because of the long years of hardship and uncertainty that had annealed me into this person. (So make your unfortunate circumstances count)

However, while the 2 parties may be happy with each other, people will say things. Nasty things. Especially if one party is not only poor but of a race that is stereotyped as ""cannot make it one"". You'll have people saying to her ""are you sure he's that intelligent?"" (because intelligence is only accorded to the upper echelons of society right) or ""people who are *my race* cannot make it one la"" or just about anything to do with race or SES. This is when you really need to know yourself (where you come from and what you are) and to acknowledge that others probably would not accept this union due to their own selfish reasons."

62403,"I need some relationship advices.

Everytime I get close to someone and grow fond of them, I tend to sabotage the whole relationship. It happened to my previous relationship too. I have said many horrible things which I know I shouldn't have said, or rather, my logical self wouldn't have said. However, I still had to hurt his feelings despite loving him. It kills me inside.

Is there anyone who knows of this problem? And how can I solve it?"
62400,"#62388 I left NUS years ago. It really depends on your degree, what you have done and what you want to do. Trying to get an engineering job or be a doctor with a biz-ad degree (even with FCH) is almost impossible while going into finance with an engineering degree (FCH) happens all the time. There are industries where you don't even need a degree to get into, for example, programming (before I get flamed, this statement doesn't mean that a CS degree is useless; it makes getting into a good company exponentially easier) or insurance. As a personal experience, I did industrial software dev after graduation even though I did not have a CS degree. However, I think I demonstrated that I can code through some demos I gave to the interviewers. 

It is difficult to give specific advice without understanding what you are doing and what you want to do."
