59599,"Convince me otherwise.

My theory is about the messed up Singapore market and in terms of dating opportunities for guys. I'm writing from the standpoint as a Single, Male singaporean who I consider decent looking but argue all you want about me, I'm here to discuss about the issue at hand.
So the issue here is Singapore naturally has a unfair environment for guys in terms of dating opportunities and my theory is tied to National Service. Lets assume that there is a same population of guys and girls for argument's sake. Out of whatever that number is, lets assume if you groom and really take care of your body and overall health you become decent looking. Assuming there is a natural number of 100k decent looking guys and 100 decent looking girls. Because of NS, the amount of Decent looking guys increased to 200k because of all the shit NS throws at us.

TLDR: 
Less supply of decent girls = shortage of decent girls
High supply of decent guys = overflowing supply decent guys

Girls naturally has a higher bargaining power and guys lose out. How can guys (decent or not) hope to survive in this environment? (P.s. I'm pretty sure most of you will say Up your standard or something along those lines which is unrealistic and all, those who have serious inputs do give your advice, thanks)"
59598,"So, I live in an RC and was going to the pantry which was on the male floor. While walking through the hallway, I passed this guy's room. And to my shock, he was sitting in front of his computer, completely topless and wearing shorts that are as short as my FBTs. Like come on, I know this is a male floor, but the pantry is on this floor and you know very well that girls will also be walking by. I don't care what you do in your room. But if you want to leave the door open, at least have the decency to wear a t-shirt, or wear longer shorts. 

As a girl, I'm sure other girls will also be shocked or disgusted by you. You know who you are, and if you're still doing this, I'll report you to OHS or campus security."

59595,"I'm a graduate student from one of the other local universities and just got my results back today. Not sure if I'm too used to the blessings of the bell curve god back in my days as an undergraduate at NUS but I was just dismayed by the subpar grade for one of my coursework modules. The important thing is: nearly everyone else in the class got a B-/C+ too, and the best grade I heard was a B. Unless everyone underperformed, or just plainly couldn't care enough to bother about the term papers and final exam, is it unfair to think that me and my coursemates deserve a better grade for all our effort?

Will a group appeal to the examining authorities be a good idea? We are pretty sure it's not going to improve our grades very much but it doesn't seem unreasonable to want to voice our grievances and perhaps, spare future cohorts from a similar fate under the offending lecturer.

P.S. grades here in my university typically range from A to B+, so unless you don't turn up for exams, B and below are usually unheard of."

59591,"Hi would like some advice.

I am applying to NUS MSc Computer Science (specializing in AI), but I don't think I meet their prerequisites, which say applicants should have a degree in computer science, or a related degree with 2 years IT experience. I have a degree in biomedical science, they taught us very little math but I learnt the basics like probability theory and calculus. I also have one year internship experience working in an AI lab. 

Just wondering, how much chance do I have to be admitted, and how challenging it will be for me given that I didn't study computer science or have a solid foundation in math. I believe I will learn a lot though, which is why I am applying. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."

59581,"Hi #59547, I dated a guy 2 years younger than me so I kinda understand how you feel. 

I was already working when I met my then bf. He was a year 1 student and comes from a poor family that relied on relatives for financial support. His uncle gave him $150 a month and he did a few internships and gave tuition to sec sch students for extra pocket money. I offered to pay for meals most of the time but he also offered to pay whenever he received his tuition earnings. 

In order to save up for our future wedding and house, we tried our best to be as thrifty as possible. We mostly dined at coffeeshops and spent our time watching downloaded movies at home. We agreed to not buy gifts for each other and to travel overseas only after he grad. Despite being so poor, he never fails to buy me my favourite food when I feel down and give me handmade cards on my birthday. 

Last year, he graduated and managed to find a job that pays well. Every year he would ask me what I want for my birthday and I would always say I don't want anything. However, a few months ago, he gave me a diamond ring for my birthday. Yes, he proposed and we are now looking for a house.  

I used to jokingly ask him if he would ever leave me for those prettier and younger ladies at his workplace. He would tell me, ""you've always been there for me throughout all these years of hardship, no one can replace the love and support you've given me, I wouldn't be where I am today if you weren't there for me and for that, I wanna give you the best life you could ever have"". 

To answer your question, yes, it is not practical to date a guy of the same age or even younger than you. You would have to make compromises and sacrifices along the way. But he would be eternally grateful for your support and see you as the most precious gem in the world if you ever stick with him through thick and thin. I would say it's definitely worth giving it a try. "
59580,"Regarding the smart girl debate, it's not really an issue about finding mates. Nor is it dismissing other talents (e.g. Athletic or artistic prowess). It's more about having our voices heard and being respected by guys. So many guys just assume that we are dumb and don't know what we're doing. I've been in so many group projects where everything i say is ignored even when I've done loads of research and put a lot of thought into the project. I have to argue twice as hard just for my project mates to even consider what I'm saying while everyone follows the confident guy even though he is just smoking his way through. There have been countless instances where an arrogant guy refuses to listen to me and caused the whole project to tank. When we talked to the professor about the project, the feedback they gave was exactly what i said. The debate is not really about smart girls vs the world. I'm just really sick of being dismissed. All girls just wanna be respected for our intelligence, as well as other ""conventionally masculine"" talents. "
59578,"The guy I am seeing lately is same age as me. Before taking it further, I really need advice whether it is practical (financially and waiting time) for us to work out. He will be graduating 2 years later than me cos of NS and that means I have to wait longer to settle down. Most of my friends are dating older guys like their uni batchmates or seniors. I am an emotional and practical person so I am torn between. What do you all think? "
59577,"Hello Whispers! I have a crush on a guy for a year but until now I still haven't told him. Ever since I was a child, I don't seem to know how to express my love for a person. Until he left me for exchange, the connection between us was also reduced by the time difference(-14hrs). A week after he left, I began to feel that I should have liked him. How do I feel this feeling? I have always been a person who can concentrate on learning, but I found that half a sem is almost over, and I feel that it is terrible to spend every day thinking about him. If I continue this way, my midterms and finals should be terrible which I don't want to happen at all.

He has a very good personality and we went hanging out a few times before he left. He told me that he is not a romantic person ever. btw we are both evergreen.  

In a way, I think I realized that I need to tell him my feeling pretty late, and he has studied abroad and will return next sem, I prefer to say these in person. On the other hand, I don't want to be rejected by him online, I guess that's feeling sucks. However, I want to let him know now then I can go back to focus on studying. 

What should I do? Any advices? Very appreciate for read this! Feeling a lot better after I typed these! "
59576,"Reading stuff here reminded me of a guy I once hooked up with. (no he's not from arts, he's from engineering, but his course is almost an even split gender ratio... His lab group last year had 3 girls in it.) Maybe it's something about these ""player"" type guys that make them apply to courses with female majorities or basically fertile hunting grounds...

He's the kind that gets hook ups often, saw his tinder match history when we were out (I was one of them). I can't say was surprised by his performance in the bedroom, coming from someone who didn't even bother counting his ""conquests"" or ""numbers"". Probably too many to count, or he intentionally left the number hazy, and I'm not sure even he knows that number.

He wasn't really male underwear model standard, just average and in good shape. Just very vocal and convincing I guess.

Though yes, I'll admit I'm pretty sold on his ""I've turned over a new leaf"" appearance these days, he's been dating the same girl for about a year, which is a stark departure from the 3 month ""relationships"" that he used to have.

I think I've waxed on and off quite strangely about this so I guess I'll just give my point here straight.

I can see him putting in effort in this relationship, and honestly as someone from the outside I can see that he's really trying his best and not just going through the motions. He's changed quite a lot since that time. So party girl, party guy, cheater or serial playboy, I think they all deserve a second chance. Reputation may be a good way to judge people, their past does tell you who they're likely to be, but it may no longer be an accurate gauge of people.

Just because people did things in the past doesn't mean that that behavior will continue indefinitely into the future. People can and do change. Maybe some don't, but I'm sure given enough effort people do change if they want to. Maybe you're not willing to be the person that gives them that second chance. Well that's fine too, to each his own. But I guess maybe it's time to be tolerant about other people's choices, as long as it doesn't affect you, I'm not sure you can really get angry about it. Why bother sticking your nose into where it doesn't belong? Don't we all have enough to deal with on our own already?

Why am I posting about this guy? Well, because it seems that his behavior has turned a complete 180. He's just so different that I almost thought that he was just someone else that looked like him. Maybe it's too early to tell whether he's really changed for the better, but I guess I'll just give him the benefit of the doubt.

Everyone has their own story to tell, and everyone has their own journey to make. Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions about who they are just because of *one* thing you've heard them do. Opinions are fine, just don't badger people with them. By that same coin, it's fine if you all disagree with me, and if you think people are set in their ways too. We'll just have to agree to disagree about this. Peace people, don't be negative, be positive. "

These are my response to the comments as of 6pm 5 March
Dji osmo pocket if you’re more serious about vlogging:)->Thinking of tech vlog, not really those walking outside vlogs

Is okay I also spend about S$1k in Taobao this morning.->Ok what did you spend it on

Rent one instead->Rent which one?

Nah, photography is for losers. Can’t you find a better hobby.->Was planning to use the camera for video recording.

Dont listen to people who say ""Money cant buy happiness"" ???? Everybody has/needs a hobby->That is why I am asking about this.

If you’re looking for affirmation here it is. Yes.->Not helpful, but ok

Buy stuff that you will use frequently, don't buy those that you use once in a while.-> I could argue that I would use those items at least once a week, would that be frequent enough?

1. Will you bring around a tripod when you are out->More for stabilizing my phone if I shoot video at home while using a device for example
2. A phone camera can easily double up as a digital camera in the $400 price range ->If want to do a tech vlog start small with phone camera then?
3. Keyboard and mouse can buy if you intend to use them daily->Ok then
4. I don't see a need for a SIM router->Because I have a 2GB/day data plan and bringing another phone around means the need to carry a power bank just in case.
5. Might be a need if you own the new MBP. I suggest looking on carousell for much cheaper type C hubs. I got mine for $49->May consider, but it is not for an MBP.
6. Might be a need if you are short on storage->More for backup purposes

Rule of thumb: if you wait for 1-2 months, you might feel that you no longer need the item. After waiting, if you still feel that these items will really aid your productivity, then get it!->1TB HDD been thinking about it since February,SIM router since end of winter vacation, camera and tripod since winter break,Type C adapter since January.

Buy everything from carousell. If you happen to not like it or need it, you can relist them on carousell and get back most of the money.->IT Fair this weekend though

Unless you intend to get an interchangeable lens camera it's difficult to justify getting a camera when your phone camera provide most of the functionality plus easier share options/->So just use the phone camera for shooting video first then?"
59572,"It can be sad to be a lonely intelligent girl here but the truth is many are seeking someone who is their equal or better in intellect but those intelligent guys don't see the need to get together with one. The main value proposition you have is intellectual stimulation but they already get that from their own boy's club, plus they don't have to navigate the emotional complexities of needing to appease an upset girlfriend because of some intellectual debate that went south and got personal. 

For most guys, even the smart ones, intellectual stimulation is low on the list. If you don't want to be lonely develop other skills, real attraction cannot be bargained with. No amount of saying how you are deserved to be liked just because you are smart will make guys like you. Has any socially awkward nerd managed to get a girlfriend just by saying he should be liked by girls just for his brains? Not very common and the reason is obvious. It's amazing that so many nerd girls don't understand this also applies to them. "

59565,"To #59518,

Being relaxed is key! When you're nervous your body will tense up which will make it uncomfortable for you, and probably for your partner too.

59562,"ok, dear #59518 OP, I know you were asking the ladies, but I'm a guy and I'd offer your bf some tips, though I don't know him so I suppose I'm offering you some tips hoping it'll help you both.

Well the first time will hurt, but I think there's a way to ease it through. Firstly, get yourself a bottle of lube. Cuz not everyone is naturally lubed up enough to have sex. Lube kinda allows it to slide in more easily, otherwise some of the pain you feel is dry skin versus dry skin of your sensitive bits trying so hard to slide past each other.

The second thing is, I think it can be a lot less painful if you both start with fingering (I hope he at least knows what to do with his fingers!). I did that on my ex first, and the advice I'm giving you got us to have sex without too much pain. The hole in the hymen should be large enough for a finger to go in. Might be a little tight at first but with lube and some patience it can be loosened up. If he knows how to find and stimulate your G spot, all the better. Gotta be real patient with this one. Use one finger to kinda stretch it a little in all directions, gradually of course. Then if it becomes loose enough, try two, and use the two to stretch it a little more.

If necessary, spread out between sessions. not all in one day.

Then finally, you can try the actual tool. Just, lube again, and lots of foreplay.

Results will differ, cuz remember every woman's body is different.

By the way, there's also the possibility you're having vaginisimus. One of my ex gf's had that, and she would recoil violently the moment I touched her vaginal opening. I didn't know what it was at the time (we were young but definitely way old enough to legally have sex).

A quick google search gets me this:
https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/sexual-dysfunction-in-women/vaginismus

BUT do bear in mind it's not a doctor's diagnosis/assessment. if you find you're having difficulties inserting your own finger without experiencing pain then perhaps you might want to see a doctor."

59560,"Is there a way to complain about lab GAs in engineering? It's obvious that the GA in my lab only has eyes for girls and doesn't care about the rest of us guys (we're in engin, there's one group with 5 girls and 4 groups with all guys). He's been pretty much ""stationed"" over at the lab group with the girls for half a semester already, but today was even worse than before. He spent about 2 hours of a 2.5 hour lab at the girls' table, and ignored several of our groups who told him about problems with the calibration of our lab apparatus that messed up our results. Not only that, but he went through the whole lab report with their group, down to the level of telling them the explanations and marking points for each question. I'm quite sure that's academic dishonesty somehow. We've tried bringing our concerns to the prof for our lab group, but he also always seems to disappear partway through the lab session."

Anyway, to respond questions regarding CAP, I was lucky. In year 4, FYP had the highest credit weights. So effectively, as long as I did A in FYP, I could mess up other modules and nothing could change CAP much. By the end of year 3, I fulfilled many graduation requirements since I did not do semester long industrial attachments. (I found that many attachment programs were borderline useless. Some big companies such as Exxon asking engineering students to deal with their retail business etc). 
I also had great lab mates to be motivated and a group of good friends  to help me focus. Since friends were Singaporean guys, they were like big brothers to me. 
Yes, it has been long long time ago. Last week, I brought my son to a tech museum and showed him old IBM PC with Floppy drive. I explained to him that that's where we saved our files. I told him that when I first arrived in University, I did not even know that those little disks needed to go there and I saved files. (computer illiterate). So, I hoped I conveyed the message to my son regarding how far we have come. I hoped it was as good as other stories of immigrant parents (usually written by Indian kids) coming to Silicon Valley with some dollar notes (almost always under $50) and became a VP in big tech company. 

I also owe a lot to great lecturers such as Prof.Aaron Tan, who made computing fun, and I ended up doing this as a career."

And that's the thing. I tell myself that. But I also see myself walking a tightrope. One failure, one slide, one drop, and everything will unravel. Everything will all go to pieces. How do I explain why I'm so tired? How do I deal with the errors creeping in, sometimes too late to notice? How can I show I'm trying? How can I, when I'm sure the outside world will only see laziness, carelessness, uselessness? How will I deal with disaster; will there ever be a coming back from one anymore?

So damn much to worry about. Will I do enough for my family. Can I keep us from going under, into poverty and suffering? Will I keep pace in this cut-throat rat race? Will I disappoint the people I know and love? What's the lowest I can sink? How can I stay afloat?

What I hope to see improve though would be the quality of the tutorials, especially when the tutorial submissions account for 20% of the grade. The tutorial is vague and ambiguous, making it extremely difficult to answer. Comparing it to the past tutorials, it is world's apart. I struggle to understand what the question is asking of me and it is difficult to draw links to the topics we learn. The ""there are many solutions"" approach because of ""the many implementations"" is a terrible one because it is too generic. I won't even get started on how the tutorial comes as a HTML file with all the HTML tags. While I do appreciate the effort that the prof is taking, with his constant spam emails, I hope that CS2106 can become more substantial with tutorials like that of Uncle Soo? Similar for the past year papers. The only past year paper we have is the one from 2005 and it's also extremely vague and iffy."

59546,"Hi, glad you are reading this. You don't know me, and I don't know you. But still, I want you to know something. You see, when we were young, many of us had the most crazy, amazing dreams. We were astronauts, dancers, actresses, singers and superheroes. I can't imagine the number of hours singing at home telling myself I was going to be a singer one day. But somehow along the line, society taught us to be realistic and to chase what is practical, and we give up those dreams to pursue more realistic ones. Also, there was pressure everywhere. Every step you took, someone was watching. Whether it was to make someone you love proud, or to show everyone you were a loser.

And I understand. The pressure is immense, and life is hard. We are all under pressure to succeed and achieve, and we felt that no one thought much of us if we don't achieve anything. We never felt so alone, growing up, looking at the achievements of others, comparing, and regretting this and that. We felt like the world has forgotten us.

But I haven't. And if this is you, I care. I don't need to know your face or your name, but I do. From one human to another, deep down, I want you to live, and I want you to smile, even if every step you take was one of suffering.

If you are out there, feeling lost, feeling alone, feeling like no one remembers or knows the real you. Don't give up. I know and I believe that deep down, you want to achieve great things, and I know you can do this, regardless of your story.

You could be suffering from depression, a cap 5.0 student, a loner, a star athlete, a party girl, a jc student, a poly student, a poor student working 2 jobs and trying to study or just someone trying to live their life. Your story is just as important as the next guy.

So go out and live, not for your parents, not for your friends, and most certainly not for me, but for you. Life is a gift, and I treasure yours as much as you treasure it. At the end of the day, we are all wanderers, venturing through space. We were all born to create, and to discover this world.

Whatever you do, don't lose hope, don't lose your humanity. Life is too short to do too many, but long enough to dedicate to something. When we look down on earth, we see one united mankind, with no divisions and no segregations. 

So you are important, your very existence, has altered the course of the universe. Yes, life is hard. Yes, life is difficult. But you are stronger, whether you believe it or not, however, is a choice. And from one human to another, I love you, and will love you always.

Love,
Your Fellow Human"

59529,"My girlfriend showed me her gallery the other day when she wanted to show me some pictures. I saw that her phone has thousands of photoshopped bbw nude pictures - all of them have the same Indian lady photoshopped in it. I asked her about it and she said that her friend sent them to her. When I asked her why she didn’t delete them, she said she was lazy to delete. Is she falling for that Indian lady? Is she lesbian or bisexual? What should I do? "
59528,"I hate seeing girls wearing a layer of powder on their faces. Imagine one day you remove the layer of powder in front of your bf, won’t he be shocked? I also hate girls that always wear revealing clothes and expose basically all their body to let guys see free show. I don’t know how to make up and act like a girl. Guys always wanted a gf that is very polite and chio. But I’m rough and not even chio, more like an ugly duckling. Guys always have high expectations of girls and girls have a higher expectation of guys. Guys will always expect their gf to be virgins and willing to give them free sex services. Girls will always want the guys family to be rich so that she can buy whatever she want and get all those branded goods. People like me will never get a chance to know guys who don’t really bother about all this. Life’s always unfair and only those chiobu will get to choose good guys and people like me will always end up single."
59526,"There’s this guy that I really like, but he seems like a player... I first ran into him when he forgot his card and he asked me to open a door for him. I’m pretty sure he likes me too, when I post Instagram stories, he will usually post a corresponding story about what I posted, or comment on my story. He’s really sporty and talented and plays multiple instruments as well as Rugby. He’s always in school with his gay best friend and that’s the cherry on the cake because it shows he’s open minded and tolerant. 

I’m really attracted to him, but I don’t want to be just another conquest. Recently, he started dressing a lot better too (probably a side effect of leaving hall lol) and started driving to school (come on, a guy who drives is hot). He’s like the perfect guy for me but I don’t know if I’m ready to date someone so ups. Any advice for how to deal with this? And how should I tell him I like him and get him to go out with me?

P.S.: he’s from arts. All the best guys are from arts <3"
59524,"Looking at all the fwb and sex before marriage posts, I observed something interesting. You will always be flamed if you say it’s right or it’s wrong to have fwb. 

Defenders of fwb always like to say “not wrong” when posed such question. Upon thinking deeper into the issue, I realize they are just playing the burden of proof game. 

By saying right or wrong, you have to take up the burden of proof and explain your stance. Explanations to such controversial topics will always be bashed and put down, no matter what you say. 

By saying not wrong, there is nothing to proof or justify. This also reduces the decision to personal preferences and opinion. Only things that are right or wrong are objective.

Instead of justifying, it’s so shrewd to shift the burden of proof and find loopholes in other’s proof in an attempt to boost your own stance. If all else fail, just transform everything into subjective opinions and preferences so that you can continue with what you do without caring what other people say. 

Thx NUS!! I learnt so much "
59521,"There's a lot of antipathy towards the  'smart girls' that have been cropping up lately on NUSWhispers, but to be completely honest I don't have any issue with women who are smart and competent in any discipline. What I have a bit more of an issue with is that there are people (be it women or men) vain enough to consider themselves a 'smart' person as a blanket term. There are so many ways one can be considered smart, and that you are particularly smarter in a few ways that society considers important doesn't make you a 'smart' person, any more than being particularly dumb in other ways makes you a 'dumb' one. 

To all the self-proclaimed 'smart' people out there reading this, please note - you are not special - at least, not anymore than anybody else. You are right that it may be quite possible that society rejects you because you are smarter in those particular aspects, and I appreciate you for raising the issue - but by making a blanket statement that the problem resides (solely) in society, and not with any failing on the part of your character, you lose out on any opportunity for genuine self-reflection and self-improvement.

59518,"To #59518,

Being relaxed is key! When you're nervous your body will tense up which will make it uncomfortable for you, and probably for your partner too. Communicate your worries and desires with each other but also trust your partner. Foreplay is important to get both parties emotionally, mentally and physically ready as well. And as some commentors have mentioned, use lube! It really helps ????"

59516,"Hi i am an incoming freshmen enrolling in August 2019. I am not sure if this is the correct platform to ask questions regarding NUS but pardon me if it’s not the right platform. 

I am looking into Project & Facilities Management (PFM) course and i was wondering how are classes like. Is it a 5 day school week? I am not intending to stay hall even though I live relatively far from NUS hence if it’s a 5 day school week, should I consider staying hall? 

Also, I am an poly grad hence I do not have good maths background. I have read online that certain subjects in this course might require maths so I was wondering will I be at a disadvantage since I do not have a JC H2 maths background. 

Thanks for answering my questions! Have a great day ahead! "

59510,"I saw a post requesting people to make sure posts here have impeccable English. But you know what’s even more annoying? People who just comment about other people’s English mistakes and typos RATHER than giving the advice that the OP wanted. 

I’ve seen heartfelt confessions who are genuinely asking for advice, but instead are flooded by comments lamenting about their poor sentence structure or typos. Some even say things like ‘instead of worrying about your family problem or whatever, you should worry about your English’ or ‘how the hell did you even come to NUS?’. Is this what we have come down to? A bunch of heartless grammar Nazis? Honestly -.-"
59509,"So I have this weird habit of not sleeping early and sleeping at very random times, so I end up sleeping at times ranging from 1am to 11am (the next day) and sometimes when I have school go to school half-dead (or full-dead) and sleep after class. I'm not particularly proud of it because sometimes it really does take a toll on me. When I tell people about it, mostly the replies are like ""don't study so hard la"" or ""wah actually I slept EVEN LATER sia"" but I was really trying to be serious. My closer friends understand but at the same time they don't provide solutions (they kind of listen to me rant and complain I guess). One of them recommended a therapist to see if this is a psychological problem or maybe even a case of insomnia (but I do get tired and I do sleep when I finally get tired) but to be honest...

I'm really scared because what if there is no actual problem? Then it would seem like I have been chasing an excuse for my bad habits.
And what if there is? Then it would seem like I can just justify all my not-so-decent grades up to now (well decent enough for honours at least)

I don't know I guess this is more of a rant than anything. I think secretly I know the solution is to meet a professional. I think most people do. 

But we don't."
59508,"to #59479 he sounds like a gold-digging, trophy boyfriend at best. congratulations on dodging a bullet. what are you waiting for? grab this chance to cut him off and make sure it is a clean break.

not to be preachy but if you try to hold him back after he had expressed his desire to leave, the only thing you will get back from him is going to be contempt and pity. if he is not nice to you the best thing to do is break up to liberate both of you - give him the freedom he was asking for and yourself a chance to find someone who is actually right for you. all the best!"
59507,"I've been working for over a year now. I've now become a walking zombie because I have this issue where I cannot bring myself to go to bed before a workday until 3-4am because I somehow have all this thoughts about work and associated issues. It's not in-your-face kind of anxiety but there's something inside keeping me glued to the computer, even when I'm just surfing doing nothing and the bed is right behind me.

Is it because I have no discipline and am being childish or do I have an underlying mental issue? I tend to amplify problems in my job and despair over my inability to communicate with my superiors. I feel that things are bound to deteriorate; I can't sustain work relationships. Things will just fall apart.

I'm afraid I can't go on any longer sleeping so little. My concentration and focus at work is affected and because of this I've made mistakes that have not done me any favours at work. I may get fired or something.

I wrote this at 3:30am. Can anyone help or advise?"
59506,"To all those super smart girls out there, I can relate to your pain but in a different way. I also had trouble finding love but it's not because I'm too smart. It's actually because I'm too pretty. My friends envy me for having plenty of suitors but what they don't know is that I have trouble choosing which guy to go out with. Sometimes I feel tired having to go out with so many of my suitors and I often feel guilty for hurting their feelings when I have to reject their advances. Being a smart girl is tough but being a pretty girl is like way tougher. Be thankful that you're just smart :')"

59502,"Hey admin, it’s the OP from #59224. Didn’t thought there are so many threads following smart girl post!! (Trying not to sound emotional, using 3rd person narrative below) 
Thank you all for listening to my story. The OP has been happily attached and has quite a lot of friends around her, she clicks well with those who shares the same passion or those she admires. To answer some of your questions, she is taking care of her appearance well as she was in charge of CCA fashion design department back in old school. 
However, she feels that sometimes there are definitely drawbacks for being unique, like many people can feel connection with you, but you can only connect with so few. She can speak a few languages, but it is very difficult for people to get a full picture of what she is thinking. She’s never a member of a girl clique either, due to skewed boy to girl ratio in her course and she’s more or less raised up like a guy, interested in history and maths. That fail in connection and constant losing interest in things other people like led her to negative thoughts and she was once keen to read through lots of  psychology books to find what was wrong with her mind. The reason why she said she could not be popular is that she could not keep small talks going.
She’s not perceived as the hardworking type either, but that is exactly what she was talking about. She’s seen girls who asked for help and attention given more credits than those who worked hard and chasing their own dreams, where hardworking and competency are definitely redeeming qualities!! She thinks it is a social phenomenon here (Asia in general) and wants to call out. As she admires smart and attractive females depicted in foreign literatures (Irene Adler for example) and she thinks competent females more widely accepted overseas. 
She just doesn’t want to be alone ."
