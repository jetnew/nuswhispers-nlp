53997,I got only median points for my 2106 midterm. Can I still get an A?
53994,"#53994 Have you thought that it is because men are just more superficial? Good looks are enough to get them going in all directions, but for many women, good looks are just eye candies until they prove that they are something more."
53993,"It's nearing the end of the semester and most of my group projects would be due soon.

Unfortunately, I'm down with a wave of depression and can't be productive. I feel like a burden on my teams. 

Yes, I do have valid MCs, but I'm not sure if it will affect my overall grade due to peer reviews or a lack of contribution to a specific part of the project which I'm in charge of. 

Is it possible to request for extensions of deadlines? Even so, I feel very bad. 

I do not wish to apply for special consideration as it would mean obtaining IC grades for those modules and delaying my graduation. 

I'm just so lost. The prospect of dying really seems nice now - no responsibilities to worry about. Makes me wonder why my attempt to kill myself few years back was thwarted. I'm suffering so much more by living."
53992,Is a degree certificate worth all the pain in university? I cannot seem to find true friends or friends with similar frequency. Perhaps I am the only one who entered university to continue learning new things and enjoy the campus life whereas most of my friends focus on grades. Do not get me wrong. I love learning new skills and knowledge but I feel very inferior studying along side with such friends. Friends who drink stay together. Is it true? I do drink but I do not find such friendships is worth my previous time. 10 weeks into Year 1 and I hate the environment I am in now so badly. Are there any advices out there? 
53990,"Recently my friends have pointed out that my taste in guys is weird...

Where most girls go for the rather athletic tall guys or at least the rather sportier ones, I tend to go for the rather skinny gamer guys... Provided they're decent looking, yes, I'm rather superficial.

My ex was rather slim, he lost a lot of weight in army attached to an infantry unit and was about 10% TBF and captained an esports team. Was kind of hoping to see him during dota IFGs this sem but it seems that he wasn't playing.

Since then I haven't dated anyone else, but the guys that catch my eye always seem to be around his build and height (he's not very tall, but neither am I...).

Is this really that ""weird"" or strange?"
53989,"Trying to move on.....more n more...though i still think of you frequently. Passing by each others with the act of we are strangers. Being heartless on the surface but painful on the inside.

53988,"In a hot country like singapore, we unnecessarily use a lot of air conditioning, powered by CO2 spewing natural gas power plants. To reduce our CO2 foot print and Ensure our posterity will have a better earth, I propose we go clothing free. By going naked, you reduce your body surface temperature by 1 degree on average, reduce risk of heatstroke. Air conditioning can be omitted 

Furthermore it reduces the need for laundry which wastes precious water.

Textile making and dyes generate toxins. Clothing free reduce pollution

I hope the university will consider making the campus a clothes free campus. 

We have taken the first step of making campus cashless, strawless. Now clotheness campus will really improve our lives, and make the leap from symbolic action to real action."
53987,"Is it just me or SOME of the track and field people extremely boastful online? Saying things like “so much speed in one picture”, “this was too easy” and shit. It is cringeworthy. I don’t see such boastful attitude in the other sports teams. This is just what I have been observing. "
53986,"i want to use my starbucks tumbler (grande) at the drinks stall, but i'm not sure if it's too big..? like the coffee or whatever i'm getting (too broke for real bucks). would the vendors mind giving me more beverage just because i have a seemingly larger tumbler? it's double walled so the inside is actually a lot smaller than the outside. will they give me less than what i pay for? because i get a drink everyday, so it's pretty cumulative down the road + it actually comes with a straw so i don't have to use that soggy paper straw"
53985,"Hi everyone, I'm a Year 2 undergrad who recently figured out that I wanted to do a 2nd major in Mathematics. My home faculty is FASS, and I'm majoring in Economics. I'm just wondering if anyone out there has any advice for planning a 2nd major? I'm not sure if I'm too late for this or what. I'm not even sure if they'll allow a year 2 to apply for a 2nd major at the end of his second academic year. Help."
53984,"fk. I really hate one of the module I am taking. Forced to take cause was outbidded for another module. Damn the prof is just piling assignments as CA which is ridiculous. 5% for an individual 25 min presentation. Another 5% for 2000 word writeup on a random topic of choice (that somewhat had relation with the module), 5% MCQ midterms. I have a feeling he is just splitting the 40% CA components into 8 5% parts; and making up those 8 parts as he goes along the semester.

FML. And now it is gonna be week 10, and I am certain he is gonna make up more assignments.

53982,"I'm not mad at the fact that plastic straws got removed per se. I'm mad at the way whoever the 바보 in-charge of this nonsense campaign did it. No warning, no lead time, no nothing just one email and 'hey no more plastic straws'. Not even a 'oh we will try to remove them like what 3 times a week or something first before we remove them all together'.  No trial, no phase-out programme or publicity or anything?"

53975,"Admin please don't filter. Is there any way to report uneven grading? This is regarding HY2250 midterms. The two profs apparently split the scripts amongst themselves, with one just returning her side when her counterpart has yet to even grade finish his pile. The marking standards were clearly very different - with that woman giving extremely harsh grades. Is there a way to flag this out to be taken seriously?"
53969,"I'm currently a freshie studying engineering in sem 1. I don't really enjoy it though and i'm thinking of changing course...i understand that the application for changing course has already opened. But I feel like i might need a bit more time to think about what i really want to do and dont want to make a rash decision so i might not apply in this round... Does anyone have any idea when would be a good time to change such that i wouldn't need to delay my graduation... would i be possible to do so after sem 2 instead.

Also, does anyone have an advice regarding this... i understand that engineering is a secure degree to have to secure a job in Singapore. I do foresee myself working as an engineer but there's a very high chance i would not enjoy it. I'm thinking of jumping into physics which i think i'm quite good at or psychology which I'm interested but I've a track record of being bad at writing . Would anyone kindly give me their advice. Thanks!"
53967,"Aside from the 1000-Straw Warrior, I get some of the valid points raised by those who don’t take well to the iReject campaign and hope to offer my views in response.

Going straw free is undeniably inconvenient and I agree with #53848 that they really add up and can make a bad day suck more. But I see it no different from stuff like taking a detour because of finding out that there’s construction on your usual route. Over time, we’ll adapt – walk another way, bring our own bottles etc. Once we come to expect it, we won’t be thrown off any more. I think calling the initiative draconian is an exaggeration. It seems like in Singapore, convenience is perceived as a human right, not a privilege and I believe this mindset has contributed to much of the backlash.

Some also suggested developing alternatives to straws. Given that researchers manage to produce a comparable, biodegradable, disposable alternative with their scientific sorcery (they probably have), consumers will still have to do their part – give them a rinse and dispose of them separately, so they don’t get mixed up with all the food waste and be incinerated with the rest of the trash. It takes two hands to clap. If people simply avoid straws/other plastics, nothing has to be done at all.

And of course, ideally, people would find the good in their hearts to be eco-friendly and we can slowly promote the culture without ‘forcing’ it on them. But most of us are too caught up with life to make eco-resolutions and stick to them despite being concerned and so could do with the push. And, as many uni students can relate, we procrastinate even for things of direct personal benefit, what more environment stuff? However, as studies have proven time and again, the environmental crisis is pressing. If “slowing down global destruction” was due at 2359, we’re probably at 2300hrs. I think too much is at stake for us to blindly hope for divine intervention or technological revolution. We can’t s/u Mother Earth yall.

Also, to agree that helping the environment should be encouraged in principle while refusing to give up even the smallest little luxuries or conveniences is just a politically correct but vacuous statement IMO. It’s like wanting to have your cake and eat it too. I’m not saying this to pagro at people who use straws but contribute in other ways. Rather, I’m referring to those who are expecting change with absolutely zero compromises or work on their part.

I think it’s perfectly fine to be pissed for a bit and offer constructive criticism about the implementation of the campaign (like having more education). It’s still in its teething stages and I think the initiative should be applauded. I’m glad that there is some healthy debate going on but the blind hate and angry tirades need to stop.

53963,"Recently, i saw a lot of advertisements on coding courses provided by some coding academies on Python, Data science and etc..

I want to do something about it now but I am afraid of rejection or the possibility that it might affect our friendship... What should I do? "
53959,"In light of the recent drama against the plastic straw “ban”, here is a perspective from someone who supports the iReject campaign and hopes that the world can rid itself of disposables someday. 

Regarding the entire plastic straw “ban”, (I say “ban” because the school stated that they provide paper straws upon request) I agree that there was a lot that can be better managed. Yes, it could have been better communicated. Yes, it might have come as a rude shock to many of us who are used having straws with our drinks. Yes, there didn’t seem to be an alternative because of how paper straws that were supposed to be given on request were not given out. Yes, it’s so inconvenient when you reach out for that familiar straw to stir your drink, only to realise that it wasn’t there. 

You know what? I like straws too, because I’m used to having them around and I can’t deny that they are convenient. But when I know that I don’t NEED them, which I don’t take them anymore. (I know I am speaking from a position of privilege when I say this because not everyone has this choice to reject straws because they can.) When I committed myself to stop using straws last year unless necessary (i.e. bubble tea pearls :3), it wasn’t hard. It’s not like going on a plant-based diet where you have to actively look for meat-free food. All it took was saying no when offered a straw while getting weird looks and questions like “huh then how you drink” “walao can don’t so environmentally friendly or not?” and using my two hands to hold my cup and drink from it. Sure, it took some getting used to but soon drinking without straws became normal – normal enough for me to diss friends who were drinking with straws. Habits can change.

I just hope that the angst that the lack of communication of the project has brought does not dilute the greater meaning behind rejecting straws in the first place. Straws are just a small part of the entire problem of single-use disposables, which are although at times necessary, most of the time they are not. At least recognise why they are a problem and realise that we as consumers are also part of the problem. All single-used disposables have a super short life cycle, which means that lots of energy goes into producing them. Energy means fossil fuels which also means emissions that could have been avoided if we all just took one less plastic straw, plastic bag, or even paper cup etcetc. They pollute oceans (google Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch), ruin lives of marine creatures (sea viral turtle video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw) and take forever to break down. Even though we incinerate our rubbish in Singapore, remember that toxic chemicals are still produced in the process. The list goes on, and I can write more if we want to bring in the topic of climate change and how it affects animals and people around the world. 

I think we can differentiate for ourselves what it means to be a need and want. Instead of tearing the campaign down, let it be a reminder to what you can and should do as a fellow human being living on this planet. 

TLDR:

[1] I hope people see the straws ""ban"" as a well-intended project despite its shortcomings, and definitely not write off the cause against disposables as meaningless. Think about whether you really need that straw, plastic cup, plastic bag, flyer before you actually take it.

[2] Differentiate between what it means to be a NEED and a WANT. (No, convenience =/= need). 

[3]  Please, please remember that the implications of taking another piece of disposable does not just come at the price of your convenience, but at the cost of our planet too. 

[4] On a sidenote, for those who feel that they absolutely cannot live without straws, here’s a gentle reminder on other ways to be more environmentally friendly –bringing your own containers to takeaway food (you even get a $2 discount in NUS!!), bringing your own reusable bags/ reusing  plastic bags for shopping, taking public transport, supporting ethical businesses etcetc

53958,"Uni really has shown me the tediousness and frustrations of group work, especially where different personalities mix. 

Put one extrovert who can't shut up in a group and suddenly that extrovert will literally drive the entire group in his/her direction, shooting down objections and insisting on his/her way.
But due to the extrovert's amazing charisma, no one really dares doubt or go against him/her. It's impossible to politely tell an extrovert to just...STOP talking for once. Meanwhile it's very easy for this extrovert to politely tell OTHERS to shut up.

A group of introverts only on the other hand, can peacefully pool together their ideas more collectively while taking into account everyone's different opinions and interests. Unfortunately it's quite rare for the latter and more common for the former, to have at least one domineering extrovert present.

With more than extrovert on the other hand, and you're likely to have some group conflict OR these extroverts now dominating the entire group direction and discussion in their way.

I'm seriously just plain sick of it. 
To any extroverts actually reading this, please learn to shut up once in a while. Learn to be receptive to others and realise you're about as wrong as anyone else. And maybe develop some self-awareness while at it.

53955,Since we are gonna stop using disposable straws then why not give out free reusable straws instead of getting around and finding places that sell it?

53953,"In response to #53953: That sounds like quite an uncomfortable situation. Maybe it was out of goodwill or convenience that you were able to try your friend's cooking at the start. However, I think it's quite apparent that you are uncomfortable with his current actions (eg. pestering you, waiting for you for long hours just to eat, etc). Bottom line, I think you should set proper boundaries with him. Since he's just a friend, and not your boyfriend or anything, I think its alright to let him know that he should not transgress sound boundaries. Just remember to do it tactfully! :) Can let him know that you still appreciate him as a friend but it'll be good if he can respect the boundaries and treat you in a respectful manner too."
53948,"Also not a philo major here, taking 2211 as my first philo mod. I find the professor puts in quite a lot of effort even given that he's taking this mod on as extra workload. He's made lectures engaging, but perhaps the TA could do with more classroom engagement...

But I do find the readings manageable as long as you keep abreast of them and clarify your doubts through email or by asking prof when you can.

There's no reason to bash him for selecting the readings - it's a intro course, so we don't go in depth, but there is still a large scope of content to cover to give a full overview of the differing philosophies. To be really frank, I found this week's readings hard too, but I don't think it's really anything to take to the streets (NUSWhispers) and shout about.

If you're really struggling and the TA cannot help, I guess you could always book a consultation with prof himself. It's philo, nobody said it was easy.

Anyway it's hard to please everyone, because well, hard mod, you get rants like this, easy mod people say ""oh the curve is going to kill me!"" 

All the best and as what #53921 said, hopefully it gets easier from here on out!

#53893, don't add fuel to the fire, your opinion is not needed here. If you don't have anything constructive to add, don't. There is no point in bashing people and calling people out when you yourself won't come out.

Yes, maybe guide them a bit, but do not cross the line which one commenter of your post said. Maybe don't show the actual code, but give a flowchart(bearing in mind that 'boundary')
And apparently this is not as bad as CS1010E. Not sure how things would be very different if EE stuck to that. But then it would be probably less painful since you would get into some C in IT1007 part 2 with some experience in Python.

Hello #53863! Just want to say, dont put yourself down like that. I too lost all my JC friends after JC, entered army and made a lot good friends there, so I can relate to that front part of your story. In fact your story reminds me so much of myself back in my JC-army-Y1 days.

However I would like to say that making friends in Uni is a totally different ballgame from NS unit days. In NS, everyone is going through the same thing together at relatively the same pace. Its easy to relate to one another, and hence make friends. You guys also live together(or even work office hours together for non-combat soldiers) 5 days a week, and in NS its generally better/advantageous to work well together with your unit mates. Hence under such conditions, friendship actually comes rather naturally, and even if it dont come in 1week, you still have the next week, next month, in fact 2 years.

Now Uni is totally different. Everyone has different commitments, everyone leads their life at a different pace, there is also not a need to work together. To make things ""worst"" you only have like perhaps 1-4hours of interaction per week from either tut/lec/cca. If you dont capitalize on that short amount of time to talk to people and try to know more people, you will find that time pass by so fast, 1 sem is over and you know no one. Next sem comes, you see new people again. 

In my y1 days i was in a similar situation as you, I wish people would just open up to me, and i was afraid to open up to others because I did not think i was worthy of anything. I was a quiet person throughout my sec sch to jc to army. However I soon come to realise that by waiting for someone to open up to me, that will be like gambling and hoping I get lucky to meet such a person. 

Year 2 came, and from that year on all the way to y4 I decided to just try to talk to anyone beside me in tutorial or lecture who I find interesting. I would say the number of times i felt like i embarrassed myself was so many I cannot count. However this should not stop you! Take it as like a learning process. Its easy to say ""I am quiet thats why i have problems making friends"". Identifying that is good, but you have to work on it too! I promise you it gets easier as you ""practice"" more and more. It doesnt matter even if you made no friends eventually, what is important is you have learned to open up and be comfortable initiating conversations, and this my friend will go a long way.

If you dont take the first step to try, you will never learn. Dont think about how others will judge you, everyone is in fact too busy thinking about themselves anyway to judge you. But one important thing to remember and live by is ""No one owes you anything"", talking to someone does not mean he will be willing to be your friend. But it doesnt matter, KEEP TRYING. 

Love yourself! When you stop putting yourself down all the time, you will become more comfortable opening up to others. When you think you are not worth others time, of course you will fear interacting with them.

Just take it as a learning process when it comes to interacting with strangers in Uni, leave friendship to fate. But one thing i know for sure is: If you dont try even fate cant help you.




"
53930,"#53863 To the guy who posted about having no friends: I certainly can empathise with u as I'm a loner myself too. You are certainly lucky to find a group of mates in army. I graduated from NUS 4 years ago and am happily married now. I feel that it would be good to share my experience here since this topic was brought up. Since young I am always extremely introverted and shy. This means not only I feel difficult to approach people, I have also no motivation to make friends. And this goes on in a vicious cycle for years. From primary school till university, I have zero friends and social life. Because of my personality, I find it extremely hard to socialize in large groups. Even on 1-1 with people, I always find that I run out of stuff to talk in a few minutes. I lived life pretty much in silos and spent almost all the time at home. 

Most of the precious few friendships I had are based on practical reasons e.g. project mates or colleagues and immediately died off once the activity is over. Other friends are mostly hi-bye friends whose friendship never progressed past a certain point. I find that as I age and mature, I do gradually overcome the shyness part but I am still the introvert I am. This means I love to spend time alone. I am working now and while I am able to get the job done with colleagues, I am never truly friends with them. I felt very lucky to have met my wife in NUS (she's a fellow introvert too, I met her by chance and it does make it easier to interact between 2 introverts but that's another long story). Now apart from my wife and family, there's no other person whom I can truly have a friendship with and enjoy the time together. I certainly have accepted myself for who I am as I know that deep down, I am still the introverted loner I am and that part will stay with me for as long as I live. I believe every one has some part in them that they might not be happy with. But it's more important to appreciate the small little good things that come into your life and be grateful for what you already have, and not mull over what you don't. Best wishes to you and hope that you'd be able to live life without regrets."
53929,Found this in the business school. So apt. 
53926,"#53888: first, the idea that modern wars will be fought not by men with rifles but rather machines, network, precision-guided munitions, etc ... is a rather old idea. It was called ""revolution in military affairs"" (RMA). Soon after, we found out that there was a ""counter-revolution"". Indeed, if you look at wars after 1945, they all followed a common pattern. Somehow they all, except for Gulf War 1.0 1991, ended with boots on the ground, infantry with rifles going in personally. This is true for Israel-Lebanon war, Gulf War 2.0, Afghanistan (the most recent, ongoing one), and will likely to be so.

The reasoning is very simple: RMA idea is surveillance technologies will become so good that anything that can be spotted will be firepower mouse clicked away. Of course your enemy is very impolite and they will try to avoid getting killed. Thermal imaging with million dollars drones in Afghanistan was defeated by ... Talibans draping blankets over their bodies, but I digress. The problem with RMA's idea is if you don't show up to the battlefield and present a target for them to shoot at, why should they? They disperse, go into hiding, then ambush a convoy of soft-skin wheeled trucks that roll down the road, plant roadside bombs, bomb the restaurant your officers go to for lunch, assassinate the officers when they pop down to the local brother, etc ... All wars have descended and regressed to infantry on infantry with rifles on rifles.

The idea of a scholar-officer is a rather British method of recruiting officers. You find a overly educated chaps with bloodlust, slap on them some nice uniforms, give them a pistol (to threaten executions of insubordinate privates), then push them to the front. The company and below commanders' primary jobs are to stand up straight and lead the men into fire. If they get killed, they did their job. On the other hand, the British army is a professional and rather well-trained volunteer army with a decent non-commissioned officers who are well-versed at the tactical fightings. The upper echelons of the British commands are also generally good officers with good leadership skills though their tactical, operational skills maybe below that of the best. So the idea of a scholar-general is not a bad one; though remember that generals have a ""last-war-itis"": they try to fight the current war like last war. Note that big wars used to occur once every 2-3 generations or so and the changes in technologies and tactics meant that the soldiers will have to pay for the mistakes in the first period of the war. The point of my post was to point out that there is nothing glamourous or macho about being a conscript; they are all meat for the meat grinder anyway. However, the knowledge that generals and officers being so far away from danger, coddled in security and comfort have a deleterious effect on morale. It manifested occasionally by the privates lashing out at the officers by ""fragging""; or killing of one's superior. Good generals have to have a balance. A compromise approach is to have a charismatic, courageous general the likes of Montgomery, Patton, or MacArthur to be the face of the command (while being less than stellar), and to have another actually competent Chief of Staff who do the actual cold-blooded calculations and planning.

The cold-blooded calculation goes something like. OK, the enemy has one Division occupying a 5km front. We want that sector. So we'll concentrate 5 Divisions on that 5km front and breakthrough. However, we need to confuse the enemy of the real axis of advance, so we'll need to tell a few poor divisions over there to attack on a 20km front. They will likely be slaughtered in the face of numerically equal but dug-in troops, but it's a necessary sacrifice to win (a paraphrased plan of Operation Bagration, 1944). Here is the point where you need a charismatic officer/general to tell the poor divisions to attack wholeheartedly and suffer the casualties.

Brad Pitt's War Machine is a thinly-veiled fictionalisation of the service of General McChrystal in Afghanistan. For a very good overview of how battalion and below commanders really work, I'll recommend the book Generation Kill by Evan Wright, which documented the action of 1st Recon Marine battalion in Iraq. The book was adapted into the HBO series: Generation Kill. The officers in there are colourful people: one good platoon commander, an aggressive but somewhat dimwitted sister platoon commander (Captain America), a more dimwitted company commander nicknamed Encino Man (a caveman-thawed-out-in-modern-day fictional character), an ultra-aggressive battalion commander who is a cancer survivor and seemingly intended to get everyone killed so he can get medals. The problem with the majority of them seem to be that the unit was a stealthy, recon unit with scholarly commanders who typically stayed behind the line and analyse the intel, but suddenly thrown into a blitzkrieg type of combat. The officers adjusted slowly and the men had nothing but contempt for them. The ""good"" platoon commander put out his own book: One Bullet Away by Nathaniel Fick.

In general, the defense of Singapore, few publications available on it as it is, is rather sound. Singapore has an arms manufacture company: ST Kinetics, and a few Defense Research organisations. They are good ways to channel tax money into developing new technologies (the easiest way to convince the public to throw money at uncertain research projects is by telling them ""it's for defense""). ST Kinetics is producing all the important weapons for modern wars: rifles, mortars, artillery, and light tracked vehicles (given that all wars descended to infantry combat).

All HDBs appear to have hardened shelters: casualties in a bombardment rise significantly if the civilians have to scramble from their homes looking for public shelters. Now if the occupants of HDBs stop shoving miscellaneous crap into that shelter (or taking off the heavy steel door) and start putting food, water, radio, battery, stove, fuel, etc ... that will be excellent. There are impressive saber-rattlings by the Singapore Air Force. I remember reading the SAF bragging somewhere that everyday they take off from an airbase with the aircraft nose pointed at Malaysia; after taking off, the aircraft all took a sharp hard turn to avoid entering Malaysian airspace, showing readiness and skills. A lazy general will simply tell the pilots take off with the nose pointing at the sea. An effect counter-saber-rattling by the Malaysian in Johor will be to tell the anti-air radar to switch on the targeting radar and ""paint"" the SAF jets, which will be detected by the Radar Warner. However, seeing that the Malaysian Defense Radar somehow missed a very big, very slow, non-stealthy, or electronic counter-measuring MH370, I'm not surprised if they could not do it."

It's so much easier be a girl in school. It's easier for normal girls to form friendship than normal guys. It's much easier for girls to get help. Girls are way less likely to get ""arrowed"" or picked up by teachers. Girl cliques can hold hands and go toilet together, boy cliques, never. I would say girl cliques are usually more close and emotionally supportive. People, young and old, female or male, are generally more gracious towards girls.

53923,"Life in nus is not what I have expected it to be.. I have worked hard to get to my dream university. It’s supposed to be a happy thing but why do I feel so miserable every single day? Also, I felt a little stigmatized as I’m older than the rest of the people in my year. I felt that people usually look down on me once I reveal my age.. I felt trapped and suffocated ... Sometimes I really want to give up, I have no friends here. I hope I can pull it through and graduate here."
53921,"Also not a philo major here, taking 2211 as my first philo mod. I find the professor puts in quite a lot of effort even given that he's taking this mod on as extra workload. He's made lectures engaging, but perhaps the TA could do with more classroom engagement...

But I do find the readings manageable as long as you keep abreast of them and clarify your doubts through email or by asking prof when you can.

There's no reason to bash him for selecting the readings - it's a intro course, so we don't go in depth, but there is still a large scope of content to cover to give a full overview of the differing philosophies. To be really frank, I found this week's readings hard too, but I don't think it's really anything to take to the streets (NUSWhispers) and shout about.

If you're really struggling and the TA cannot help, I guess you could always book a consultation with prof himself. It's philo, nobody said it was easy.

Anyway it's hard to please everyone, because well, hard mod, you get rants like this, easy mod people say ""oh the curve is going to kill me!"" 

All the best and as what #53921 said, hopefully it gets easier from here on out!

First of all, it was never my intention to be mean towards foreign students. I know and can empathize with how hard it is to leave your country and to study alone in a foreign country. I wrote the post to understand and find out why there is such a disparity in proportion of locals and foreign talents. Only to find out that other nationalities pursuing PHD have it harder than locals as they need to clock in more TA hours. (Which we never be aware of, if not for the comments) 

And tbh, we are jealous of most of the foreign students' stellar CAP. (Apologies for the rant) 

But I guess discrimination will always exist? 
Tbh, you should have already known about this, so you can't blame us too (Just imagine us going to university in your country, taking over places that 'should be for the locals' like brilliant, talented yourselves. Bet you would feel indignant too and we would probably experience many times more of discrimination if we were to study there) 
But I guess you would never experience this because brilliant, talented Singaporeans like us would never go to study in your country (Brilliant, talented Singaporeans care too much about prestige and reputation to settle for anything insignificant) 

Just as we put ourselves in your shoes, do put yourself in other peoples shoes too, so don't blame others.

53915,"Hi #53911 #53863 I dare not say I've felt what you felt but I just want to share with you how I coped. I'm a second year myself. From the very first semester, I've been alone. I have my meals alone, I attend lectures alone. And today, it's still the same thing. For awhile I wished to be able to make friends too, but after a semester or so, I realised, it's okay to be alone if all the friends that you are going to make are either hi-bye or appears-when-they-need-you or the only-talk-about-schoolwork. I'm not saying that you shouldn't make any friends, but I'm trying to say that it is okay to be alone for awhile until you find a bunch of people or even just one other person you ""click"" with.

As for school work, because us NS peeps have a rusted brain up there, it will take awhile to get adjusted. No worries, the SUs are there for a reason. That being said, you have to recognise the difficulty and then adjust accordingly for your next semester. Most importantly, if the obstacle gets overwhelmingly hard, take it one step at a time. Don't look too far ahead. I.e. don't think that you cannot make it to your final year, just focus on learning your current modules.

Lastly, a friendly advice, love yourself more. One thing I learnt is that ""no one cares about you until it affects them"". So only you can love yourself. Try your best and then give yourself credit for having worked hard :) I'm rooting for you pal. Fighting!"

I can empathise with what you're going through, and what you're feeling.
And I won't bother trying to convince you or proclaim to be an expert on the technicalities of socialising.

Long story short: Make the best outta life. Literally.
When you start to genuinely realise the time you have alive and the time you have to do what you love, is finite, then do you truly understand how to ""make the best"" out of life. You mention you're ""secretly filled with emotions"". Why keep it a secret? Is that what you'd want to do for the rest of your life til you die?

""Move on with life"" ""Adapt, I was told"" ""I try, but it just doesn't get me anywhere""
That's because you aren't really trying. You're just taking those phrases at their shallowest level.
MY advice to you would be to live life to the fullest. Still can't grasp what I'm trying to mean? 
A cruder definition would be: Imagine you only have a week to live before you die. How would you want to live your life?

Pardon any grammatical errors or if I wasn't explaning in depth enough. Too lazy to over explain and proof read."
