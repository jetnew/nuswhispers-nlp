55298,"what is cs1010s final median usually like? i read some mod reviews online say its ard 70.. but like how they even know it cos i think it's not told to students, who don't even know their final results? is it legit 70? i feel its way too high... btw totally screwed on the dictionary qn. thought n segments were n digits. 25 marks gone. die.

55297,Is it me or is it that this sem's GET1029 philo finals is pretty depressing? I scored single digit sia. Anyone else who also did almsot as badly? I know philo bell curve quite steep for past sems but not too sure for this time round
55296,"Just finished the final paper for CS1010S and I have to say, this must be my worst examination experience ever, after 3 years in NUS.

First off, I was seated at the back of MPSH-1B and somebody's phone was ringing on and off for a good half an hour. I could see an invigilator trying to search for the source of music but she gave up after a short while. Is that the correct procedure to resolve this? There should be one for this case right, amidst all your rules about what to do in case of a fire and all. So it is okay to just let this disturb students? I believe we were all trying our hardest to ignore it but in a stressful situation whereby mere clicking of pens/ shaky tables can tick students off, this is completely intolerable. 

Next, I had a question for the prof as I needed clarification and it took me half an hour or so to get it settled. I get that it is a big hall with lots of students, but there were lots of invigilators walking about too. I raised my hand for a long time, trying to get someone to notice me before giving up and skipping that question. When someone was near me, I asked him and he said I had to ask my prof for the answer. Er, hello??? Obviously I cannot get to him, you would have to help me. He asked for the prof's name and said he would help. 15 mins went by without anyone answering my query and when I decided to ask for help again, I noticed he was just standing at the back of the hall, staring ahead. WTH? I was this close to walking up to find the prof myself when another invigilator finally noticed my raised hand and she immediately took down my seat number, my question, and approached the prof for me. I got my answer within a minute. 

By then, there was only an hour left. I spent the first hour trying to do my paper whilst raising my hand constantly to get someone to answer my question + trying to ignore that annoying music. Needless to say, I could only fully concentrate after that hour.

I cannot believe this. In which situation is having a cell phone ringing for an extended period of time + having invigilators who are unwilling to help, acceptable in an examination? Please, do improve on this and not let this happen again."

Sometimes I also wish I'm normal. Like really liking women and holding a gf's hand in public. I imagine myself kissing and cuddling with her on the train platform while sending her home. Then I become confused about my sexual orientation again.

I had an instance of another couple(?) study quietly only to begin talking louder and louder over time, till the point where they forget they're in the library. Another instance was of a couple that just came right in, sat right in front of my face then immediately started talking blatantly all the way. It's ok to communicate once in a while, but you don't make it some hour-long the conversation going on and on. Even if whispering, it's really annoying and distracting.

How do you deal with these people? You try sussing them and you come off as the rude person instead. Maybe the library should plastic a 'KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT' sign on every table."

55268,"#55268: you know what's the first thing that popped in my head?

This scene from Breaking Bad season 1, episode 7 ""A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"":

[Walter and Jesse are meeting Tuco at a junkyard]

Jesse: A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place?

Walter: What's wrong with it? It's private.

Jesse: This is...This is like a...a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet. This is like, ""Oh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me.""

Walter: Yeah, so...so where do you transact business? Enlighten me.

Jesse: I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza. Nice and public. Open twenty-four hours. Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza. Hell, why not the mall? You know, wait at the Gap. ""Hey! It's time for the meet!"" You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius. Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco, you know, comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death.

Yeah, tip for everyone meeting someone you have never met in person before: choose a public place with lots of people. If they don't show up, you don't look like an idiot standing in the middle of an empty lot and there are things that you can do at that location anyway. A random person standing around wandering in an empty car park arouses suspicion: a police can show up asking questions."

Turns out we weren't really official to him.

Though we knew each other since secondary school, having been in the same elective programme and meeting at a joint school workshop, we didn't get together till much later since he was in a long term relationship at the time. After jc we went out and decided to make it official, and when he enlisted we stopped meeting so often. There wasnt much time since he was in camp a lot because of his appointment and because it was somewhere ulu near changi Airport, he'd showed me on the map before but I forgot, it's been 2+ years so well... But anyway that was kind of why we didn't meet up much. It took a long time to get back to civilisation.

All through it he was sometimes really tired, but he'd still make it to our dates and stuff, and head over to my place afterwards. I found out later after we broke up over something else that he'd been seeing some other girl from his JC behind my back, and I'd actually met her before, but he told me she was just a good friend.

I don't think you sleep with your good friends.

Oh well, saw him in school a few days ago with another girl again. Wonder what happened to his other girls, but nah not really.

Should have been slightly warned by the fact that he was in his first relationship in sec school despite being in a boys school... And then after JC I was his 3rd ""official"" but I suspect like 7th ""unofficial"" ? Like wow man, that's quite the turnover rate."

55253,"During final examination periods, I always ask myself what is the point of trying so hard for a degree I don't even care about. If I could turn back time, I would have told myself to take a gap year and explore my interests instead of rushing to enter into uni. I can only blame myself for not changing my course or taking a gap year when I had a chance to. :(

But I can't be victimizing myself anymore. I have to start taking charge of my own life. I really can't wait to end my exams and work on upgrading myself with skills that are required by the industry I'm keen to join. 

And if anyone else out there feels like I do, don't give up. Believe in yourself, you can do this!! All the best. :)"
55252,"I've seen posts about guys being unable to find girlfriends. Anyway, here's a big tip - don't. Stop the search. If you are bent on looking for a girlfriend, all the girls around you can sense the desperation from a mile off. Take it easy, spend time on yourself instead and improve yourself (not for the sake of getting a girlfriend, but for the sake of yourself) and find hobbies to spend time on 

Anyway, a relationship really isn't that important so both girls and guys don't find self worth in whether or not somebody likes you - regardless of whether anyone is romantically attracted to you, you still matter a lot and you're still important "

55246,"To OP of #55125 You kidding me bro...? CEG is easy? Gimme a break man~

Please lah... I've heard of people wanting to transfer from CEG to CS because the curriculum is too unmanageable and difficult ><

And plus, the CEG course is AT LEAST 80% group work leh.... You think what? Just study mostly theoretical stuff and get good grades...? They have to apply what we learnt in theory also, and they need to get along with their groups in group projects. Their course has a lot of modules with hands-on things to do...

Anyway regardless, we will be marked down in our group projects if we possessed a low EQ.  This applies to anyone, regardless what course.

P.S. Just to clarify, it's just you that has low EQ. And even a senior told you to stop reinforcing the stereotype of CS majors xD

55237,"Hi #55301, OP of #55237 here, just to clarify some things - she's been fangirling over him ever since they met in one of their course mods, and basically gushing about it. I'm not saying that it means anything, but she's been emotionally distant since she met him, and it seems that even though they just met they're abnormally close. I'm not sure about how you see it, but for me it's slightly alarming that they go home together almost every day, and I'm pretty sure that their timetabling can't be so ""zhun"" that they're in the same class for literally everything? Either he shifted his classes around to meet her, or the other way around.

Maybe it's paranoia or just me. But I can't shake the feeling that people don't get so close to each other that fast in under a semester without something going on behind the scenes. I've mentioned that she's been emotionally distant, and that we haven't seen each other much of late since we've been rather busy. But despite the emotionally distant part - she seems to be rather overeager? Like she's emotionally distant, but on occasion it seems like she's trying to make up for something and seems extra nice and stuff. I know that sounds weird, but to put it more clearly, she seems nicer and happier, but less emotionally involved with me? It just seems like she was trying to hide something.

I thought at the time that it could have been just my paranoia too, but the speed at which she got with the other guy was alarming - it was barely a month after we broke up, and I wouldn't say our relationship was on the rocks. I heard she went home with him barely a week after we broke up, and she wasn't the type to jump into bed with just about anyone - for us it took months, so I'm quite sure of some things, I just don't have any evidence. Yeah, I know I'm insecure, but I made it a point not to badger her about her male friends, I only asked cause he kept coming up in conversation.

I've been trying to find evidence of it for some time now, but I can't seem to find anything. I've been stonewalled by her friends and sometimes even by mutual friends, and she doesn't seem to accept follower requests anymore - her social media seems to have gone dead.

I know it's still conjuncture on my part, and I know all of this might just literally be me overthinking, but it's not a good place right now. All of this is hindsight, and I'm not sure of what I'm seeing, so maybe I may have been too accusatory. I'm just confused right now. TBH, all my friends tell me I'm overthinking this, but my head's not listening.

I know it's time to move on, and that maybe I'll never get closure from her, but it's hard I guess...

Anyway finals have ended for me, so it's just me, my thoughts and I again..."
55236,"Hi #55220,
I believe that you are seeking to live a simple life with a partner. I have a similar view with a different preference to pursue the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) and minimalist lifestyle and spend the rest of my time travelling and volunteering like the Canadian couple in Millennial Revolution blog. I hope that you are not discouraged by some of the negative comments as sometimes it is alright to just ignore the typical viewpoint and do what you believe it is right for you as long as you are happy. It is okay to not follow what most people do nowadays as everyone has their preference to live their way of life. Just don't try to live in other people's narrative which most people are doing anyways. Best of wishes and don't forget to be awesome!

Whether to cut loss depends on things like whether you need this sum of money in the near future for a wedding, house, loan, etc. Next, it also depends on your reason for entering into nvda - investing or trading. 

If it's investing based on fundamental values, reassess it's value again based on its recent balance sheets and decide for yourself from there whether to sell it. If it's still fundamentally sound and you don't need the money in the near future, you can consider holding on to it for the long term. 

If it's for trading, I'll personally cut my loss and take this lesson as paying school fees to the market for not setting a stoploss. For trading, holding onto a trade that goes against your setup has an opportunity cost of entering into other money making trades.

He wants to make something out of himself, and not just rely on his parents' money, and I intend to pursue my higher education and career as well. He motivates me to want to work harder/smarter, be a better daughter, and a stronger leader. I also really like how we match up in terms of academic performance, ambition and drive, yet still manage to make time for each other. I know some people may say ""just elope"", but I cannot neglect my duties as a daughter, and I will never allow him to hurt his parents like that.

I don't really know how to comment, but people say when a person marries, you don't only marry to the person but to his/her family as well. Unless your other half is willing to, go against his/her family, but in normal circumstances, it is really difficult. 

One of my parents have strained relationship with my other parent's family, which I never knew why and I had to bear substantial pressure, when gradually I was asked every year ""Why didn't your xxx come back?"" Until a certain time, they finally realised the answer was clear. And for almost a decade, I never visited that parent's family. I was also made to bear grievances from that parent.

It could really be a problem that extends to your child. Think carefully and take care. I hope for all the best in you"

About 3 years ago I was in your position: my parents were opposed to our relationship since we were from different socio-economic class and ideology (if that can be counted as such). What I found to work is for both of us to be determined to never give up, standfast, and never compromise on the idea of being with each other. In dealing with my parents, I parried all attempts to convince me that can have a better life with someone else. I acted in a firm, but polite way. No dramatic stunts like getting marriage certification behind their backs, getting my GF pregnant, etc ... We had our fun and all but we are committed to the idea of being together to the end.

One contributing factor is my cousin's dream marriage (in the eyes of my parents: families from prestigious backgrounds) crashed and burned during that period. Seeing what they thought was perfect obliterated right in front of them probably changed their minds."

55200,"I've been reading through various posts on suicidal urges, depressed confessions, the stress of exams, the vain pursuit of grades, the overwhelming feeling of inferiority and the trashy feeling of being used as an tool for someone else's gratification. I think everyone is feeling quite upset for various valid reasons. 

While studying for the exams the past week, and feeling really caught up in all the negativity, anxiety and self-doubt that pours forth everyday, incessantly - I had an epiphany and I would like to share it. 

It would probably sound very lame for some people. It's probably an axiom that self-help books preach all the time. You might have heard it come through the lips of your friends/loved ones. I might have heard it before as well - but when you genuinely connect with that thought at a deeper level than just reading words or hearing vocal sounds, its full impact hits only then. 

Here's the realization I had: we must learn to preserve a part of ourselves, whatever this 'part' means to you - that is impervious, independent and absolutely inviolable from whatever happens outside of you, from whatever happens TO you. I know it sounds like some philosophical bull that makes no sense. 

In other words, no matter how badly you flunk your exams, no matter how many times you get rejected by your crush, how much insults have been hurled at you, how many fun occasions you have been excluded from, how little friends you have, how mean people are to you: 

Please keep a part of yourself protected, sacred and cherished. This part of your mental sanity, your pride, your dignity - whatever it is: you need to create it, find it, own it - you need to keep it safe and sound. Just think about it as if you're on a flailing ship caught in the middle of a destructive storm, and amidst that tossing and turning, slamming from side to side: there's that one thing on the ship you choose to hug tightly to your chest and you know you will never sacrifice it to the biggest winds that blows, or the sharpest lightning that strikes.

This is the part of you that will remain truly yours, and for no one and nothing else to handle. Never let the hardest exams tinker with it, never let the biggest crush tamper with it, and never even let those you trust hold it; not even delicately. You and only you have the right and the power to choose what happens to it. Yes, maybe it's selfish - but it's necessary.

I believe that when you can find and protect this one part of you at all costs; external conditions and events can still hurt and damage you, but you won't be utterly destroyed into unrecognizable ruins beyond repair. Because this part of you, this sacred inner core of yours will still survive, and after the wave of disasters - you won't be the exactly the same person, but you will still be you, somehow. And you, like this inner core - will still survive.


TL;DR - PROTECT YOURSELF!"
