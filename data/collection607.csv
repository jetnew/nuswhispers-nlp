60797,Who else is fcking annoyed by the noisy construction going on beside CLB ????????‍♀️ NUS has one job to provide us w conducive spaces to study and can’t fulfil that? Can’t do construction during summer meh? 
60796,"In reply to comments in #60827, I am 29, had 3 gf, 1st one 2 years, 2nd one 2 months, last one 9 years.. so technically the 9 years one was before I entered NS, and it was one day when I need not book in, I get a chance to meet her and it was then I saw the message on her phone that read ""Hey, wanna meet up? I miss doing with you."" And her reply was she gotta meet bf.. and that guy replied ""find some excuses man.. my house is free today, parents went overseas.."" So upon reading that, I got mad at her and walked off.. she chased after me and say I shouldn't be mad at her.. and seek for my forgiveness and asked for a second chance.. but it was a doom of no return.. regretted giving a second chance cuz she still did it again with another guy this time.. and probably the previous guy too.. sigh.. it was a stupid 9 years of my life wasted on her.. so OP of #60796, i kinda get what you mean when guys cheat.. Cheating has become so common that I dont know what is real anymore.. "
60795,"To #60735, this is my response to your post. Your original post is in quotation marks.

“I recently broke up with my girlfriend. I took it really hard cuz she has been thinking for it for awhile yet she has never told me.”

It appears that her attraction for you have been falling for quite some time. As a guy, one of your roles in a relationship is to look out for her attraction level, even if you are married. Once it starts to fall, you should take action to bring it back up. If you are unsure of her attraction level, it is better to assume a lower one, before it becomes too late. 

“It exploded on me when I am most vulnerable.”

If her attraction level had been falling for some time, and you have been more attentive to her, it should not come as a surprise for you.

“We talked, on one hand I know it's beyond hopeless to get her back. She told me I am just too emotional to not be able to see that our relationship is toxic.” 

She had been trying to tell you about how she thinks the relationship is not working, i.e. her attraction level for you is falling, but it seems that you were not listening to her. Communication is two-way, you need to listen. Only when you start to listen, then you can know how to fix the problems in the relationship.

“As I look back, I really disagree. We had our overwhelmingly good times. She just could not see it. You were the one who told me all couples had fights. You give up way too soon. 3 years packed with memory going down the drain.”

You are ignoring the present, and living in past memories.

“Oh how I wish I knew about this. You don't know how much I am willing to change for you. For all the happiness that you have ever brought me. I can say for sure you are well worth it. Another chance at love please..” 

Are you begging her to give this relationship another chance, after you broke up with her? Girls do not want a guy to beg her into doing anything; they want a strong guy who knows what he is doing and is not wishy-washy. Move on, plenty of fish out there.

“I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen. Idk if all break ups are like this, but this seems unnecessarily painful. Maybe you should have waited until I am less emotional. Maybe do it during our good timesml. Dont let go babe....” 

You are thinking that she is the only one for you, as if your world revolves around her, and ignoring all the other options. Move on.

60791,"My friend who looks average cheats on his girlfriend who looks like a model on a weekly basis given that he is here at States for NOC. I'm his close friend and I hardly know his girlfriend but I do have my own sense of morality and I have talked to him about this, for which he acts in denial and justifies his action saying that it is normal for guys to cheat on their partners when they are on a long-distance relationship. Recently, he heard news about his girlfriend hanging around with some other dude in NUS and also that she went out with him on few occasions which really pissed him off when he heard it from his friends. He talked to me and others about this yesterday and I am really irritated to the fact that he blames his gf for socializing with this new friend of hers. I mean, under normal circumstances I would agree with him, but he is no saint to talk bad about his gf to others."

60780,"Woah cannot take it already. I joined this CCA, a student body representing my class. Thought it was going to be a good learning experience but there is this faculty advisor.

She, presumably want to curry the HoD favour, went to accept a major project. Long story short, she imposed the project on us, refused to get help from other students, talked to us as if we owe our living to her, couldn't stop being incessantly sarcastic and passive aggressive. 

Utter demeaning and ironic to her honour roll teaching recogniction award. She even went too far as to tell our potential sponsors that they cannot don't sponsor because they have earned money from selling equipment to our department. 

Disgusting. "
60779,"Recently, I lost my ez link card in one of the residences. When I went to check the place I thought I had lost it, it was no longer there. So for a few days, i went to the office regularly to check the lost and found. This card has my name on it so it is easier to find than other normal  ez link cards. After a week, i remembered that i had registered my card in the ez link mobile app. When I went to check the past transactions, i realised someone had been using my card to travel around instead of returning it to the lost and found. 

It is unbelievable that auniversity student are doing this. The amount i lost was not much (less than $5). What was more disappointing was the lack of honesty by the person who took the card. 

So, if you are reading this, i will just let you know that you will have to face the guilt of having travelled around using someone else's money regardless of how much you used from the card.

To the rest, if you see someone else's property, remember to return it to lost and found."
60777,"To add on to #60723 and #60724 which I support wrt to the straw debate revival, I'm pretty tired of seeing all of the strawman arguments that ""we have to start somewhere and take the first step"", because I neither see this as starting anywhere or taking any concrete steps forward. So to those who made this argument, can you post your ideas on what the next steps are moving forward? Because until then afaic we are not making any progress other than in showing that all we are capable of are symbolic steps with no material benefits to the environment."

60768,"Seeking for an advice. How do I let go of my feeling for my crush amicably? We were long time good friends and I confessed quite some time ago and I got a neutral response. Due to some reasons nothing happened, but I still feel happy and excited whenever we chat. Happy when I think of him and still feeling exactly the same like when I have a crush on him.

I wanted to move on, but I dont feel sad or heartbroken or anything as he didnt reject me. Trying to meet someone new but at night all my mind flashes is my crush and I still feel excited as if the confession never happened.

And I have no idea why. No space for you? Too bad but I'm not gonna put my bag down which takes up a person's worth of space. It's not like your bags contain gold bars or they are glued to your back. Is it that hard to just put your bags down and let more people board? Are ou worried that your bag is going to be dirty? The inconvenience can't possibly be worth more than the time spent waiting for the next bus. If anyone reads this and is guilty of whatever I've said, next time just put your bag down.

We have never confessed to each other that we love each other in a bf-gf way, though we talk like we are already dating. We cry together, we laugh together and now I am in love.

60745,"Been reading the whole fiasco about plastic straws. It's really disheartening to see how people have so much to talk about how straw bans are insufficient to help the environment, what's the point etc. If you have so much to say, what have you done for the environment? Would you rather do nothing and shit on efforts rather than appreciating the small deed people do? If you choose not to make a change and would rather perpetuate the degeneration of the environment, by all means. But don't stop others from doing it, or don't whine about things. It's a free world, sure, so as much as you can talk about the ban, others can also choose to support it. Seriously, I am not suprised that these kinds of topics only arise in Singapore. Other 1st world countries have made leaps and bounds forward regarding environmental protection. Singaporeans are one entitled lot who only care for comfort and convenience, except for those who genuinely care. Get your head out of your own little bubble and broaden your mind to other real life problems. It affects everyone of us, so we all have to do a small part, no matter how insignificant it may be. Unless of course, you are fine with the extinction of the planet and this whole despicable human race. "

And I won’t bother much if I die on the operating table because of the surgery. I often curse myself that I will get cancer one day and leave everyone else behind. I use my long nails to cut my wrist when I’m having negative thoughts in my mind.

I always end up getting mentioned in their discussions and it impacted my mentality of having my classmates as friends. So I always ended up being a loner all myself. I wished I could get slim, get married and settle down to have a family. But finding a bf that suits me is gonna be difficult. What should I do?

I’m sorry for offending you or anything to the point that you had to block me. I wish you would tell me what did I did to upset you so that I can improve on it because it sucks to find out that I have been cut out of your life.

I really do treasure our friendship and our times in JC together and I know we had some conflicts and misunderstandings but we talked about it and I genuinely thought that we resolved it and were okay... but I guess not. This isn’t the first time you have blocked me on a platform but when I asked you about it last year, you said it was an accident. A hopeful part of me is wishing that this is another accident too and we can finally resolve whatever tension we have between us. I’m afraid of directly asking you again because I don’t think that’s what you want, given how you quietly blocked me from your Instagram. So I hope that in your own time, you can come and talk to me about it. I don’t want to force you so I’m leaving it up to you. Please, just tell me frankly what did I do to piss you off. 

I really do want to resolve our issues because I treasure you and our friendship, RCH. However, I understand if you just want to cut ties with me because you’re not obligated to give me a reason. I’m just trying my luck and praying that you read this and hopefully, talk to me."

60719,"Hi again,

I posted #60611, and from the comments I think a lot of people have misinterpreted my reason for posting it. I was not looking for reassurance of my abilities. I was trying to find out if sexism and gender discrimination is a problem that many girls like myself face, or that I'm just unlucky. At the same time, I wanted to raise awareness of implicit gender bias. A lot of us think that we are not sexist. However, because we grew up in an environment where gender stereotypes were ""imprinted"" onto us, sometimes we subconsciously are. Now that we are aware that we might be unintentionally biased, we can make a conscious effort to correct/unlearn it. 

You are not good with kids ""for a guy"", just because traditionally women are the caretakers. You are good with kids, period. You are not a good engineer (or programmer, or mathematician, or scientist, etc) ""for a girl"". You are good regardless of your gender. Stereotypes are unhealthy for everyone. 

Lastly, to the girls in male-dominated fields who feel like you don't belong, feel like you're less competent, less qualified, or just /less/, I want to tell you that you are not. You earned your spot to be there, and you deserve to be there as much as everyone around you does. Don't let anyone tell you that you are only valued just because you are a girl (in a sea of guys), and don't let anyone judge you based on that. 

Thank you all once again for your time, and I hope we can work towards a more equitable society. "
60717,"Exchange student here, been reading complains about CS2030. I have 2 suggestions, practices currently done in my college, that perhaps the course coordinators can consider: 
1. Fixed weekly consultation slots held by student teachers. I understand that in NUS student teachers are paid per hour and not paid an incentive if they conduct consultations outside of formal lesson timeslots? If so, I would suggest that weekly consult times be made 'formal' and these student teachers be paid accordingly. With the number of student teachers in this mod, maybe 30mins-1hr per student teacher should cover the entire week, allowing students some guidance over asking google. It is only fair to expect student teachers to be unwilling to take questions outside of lesson time if they are not compensated for it. However, at current, consultations with the prof seems to be a challenge as well.
2. Releasing of answers immediately after submission of assignments. Not sure what the teaching methodology is here, but back home, coding is taught through lots and practice, feedback and reading other people's codes. I suppose providing insightful feedback on our code comes at a cost giving the cohort size, but providing the solutions to our weekly assignments comes at almost no cost. I m sure students will benefit if they could have some form of reference instead of coding blindly every lab not knowing how they can do better."

Free 4MCs? I would willingly have the school take away 4MCs away from the current credits I have completed just for a chance to join Orbital. And no, it is also not because I wish I could skip NOC interviews. 

Coming from a non-soc faculty, it is really difficult for someone like me to meet and learn from SOC students. It doesn't help that so many of my non-soc friends have literally given up on CS after / while taking CS1010. So to me, it's an incredible opportunity to network, gain experience, get feedback, and work with SOC students. I would definitely even consider crashing the seminars if I could actually get information on where they are held and at what time. So yes, there are still people out there who want to join orbital for the right reasons, not just for the free 4MCs as you suggested. 

I could probably (and am going to have to) learn everything by myself, but the way I see it, orbital is NOT overrated; its true value lies in allowing peers to come together to work on a project and learn from each other. But as you said, ""there is no room to blame the organizing committee"" and ""grow up"", and I completely agree. Just gotta go a different route and work on my own projects, on my own during the summer. 

Really hope the organizing committee considers increasing the quota for non-soc students in the future, so that students from other faculties will get the chance to work with soc students more.

60702,"Sorry guys, I need to rant and get this off my chest. I don't know what's up with loyalty nowadays because there seems to be a real lack of it. Either that or I have been extremely unlucky. 

So I found out my ex cheated on me when she recently went on exchange. I tried to forgive her, gave her a second chance, only to find out she got involved with more guys again later on. Imagine a hot knife being slowly driven down your back with a good ol twist at the end. So I wanted to know what really happened and what I did wrong but all I got were inconsistent stories where I found out she was actually omitting and twisting the facts. 

I even found out after that that she was lying to me all along about her previous infidelity and that she had actually cheated on her ex too, which honestly would have changed my mind about getting together with her in the first place. Looking back, I still remember the way she used to tell me about how she ""valued"" honesty and transparency, as if to distract me or divert my suspicions away from her. 

I finally left her but with all the lies I've been fed, I really don't know what to believe anymore. She loves to flirt with other guys (even when I'm physically standing next to her) and I wouldn't be surprised if there were more third parties involved. 

Tbh I had a strong feeling something was wrong from the beginning(and throughout) and I beat myself all the time for not acting on my suspicions and leaving her earlier. Till today I struggle with trusting and being vulnerable with people around me, even those with genuine intentions to help. I just hope that it'll get better and I find proper closure one day. "
