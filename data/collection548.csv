54896,"Dear #54920 and #54896

I didn't bother to read any of your entries, I stopped at ""suicide"".

I have a cousin who is recovering from his second battle with cancer and never once did he attempt suicide.

During his treatments, he continued to attend school, this is despite feeling like hell due to chemotherapy. He also frequently visits the children's cancer ward to talk to children, listens to their hopes and dreams, while being hooked to an IV himself. All of the nurses knew him as the most cheerful patient they worked with. He did all of this despite not knowing if the treatment was going to work, whether he would live to experience his next birthday. He continued to live life to the best that he can, and we all know that a massive spectre of uncertainty is haunting him every single second. 

He went through multiple surgeries to remove tumours, a copious amount of chemo, and a bone marrow transplant, which I don't have to tell you, is one of the most challenging procedures in medicine. He spent months in quarantine after the procedure. We could visit him but we would have to be separated by a glass wall. Despite all of that, every time I met him, he smiles and tells me ""it's life, if it were easy it wouldn't be worth it"". He has so much positivity, so much strength, despite being in circumstances that is orders of magnitude more pernicious and tragic than anything any physically healthy people will go through. 

Having cancer is both an emotional and physical challenge, especially being diagnosed in 20s, not in your 50s like everyone else does. He made a choice. He never once stopped fighting, and always took things one step at a time. All his doctors could tell him was ""try this, and try that"", none of them have a guaranteed solution to treat or cure him. But even when his dreams were on the line, he would always say to me ""who knows, they might invent a cure tomorrow.""

Here we have someone who loves life, who loves people, who is fighting to live just one more day in order to make lives better for others. On the other hand, we have people who are making foolish attempts to end their lives, despite being born in a first-world country, and having been given the chance to attend university. Life is unfair. The odd thing is the people to whom life has been most unfair to, are always the ones whose lives are most treasured. If you do not appreciate life, then just end it, you don't have to complain about how others have been unfair to you, nobody cares and nobody wants to know. You have been unfair to yourself, because you can't even do the one thing to your own life—protect it. 

If you are curious, yes, I am diminishing the challenges you are facing. Grow up. If you can be rational enough to write a coherent post on the internet, rational enough to decide to share your story, I'm sure you are smart enough to understand that you have a choice. If you choose to end up in a situation where you don't think it is absurd to commit suicide, then I don't think anyone deserves to hear about it. "

54888,"A few comments about NUS (and hope to see these changes):
1) why are the aircons switched on along corridors of profs’ rooms and classrooms when there’s no one? (FASS) - talk about saving the Earth. Could probably move away from central air conditioning and work around with individual aircons in each rooms (the adjustsment knob is kinda confusing for some too). And are aircons really needed for corridors - do people really utilise it along corridors?

2) build humps on the two directions of roads (the bend of road from nus Sheares hall/Temasek hall to fass - end of AS7). cars are usually going too fast along the bend and may not see the students in time 

3) raise the zebra-crossing humps along the roads leading to science faculty. The ones near the running track. Unfamiliar cars may not be able to see the zebra-crossing because the roads are sloped upwards - they may just zoom pass it without noticing for students crossing"

One time, I took 5+ seconds to plug a micro usb pin into my power bank because I was holding the usb pin wrong way round.
My friend, who was watching me for those 5 seconds, asked me, ""You take CS, and you take so long to plug in a charger to a power bank?""
I told her - ""Dude, our profs don't make us sit in a seminar room and teach us how to plug a micro usb into a power bank.""

Just a strange feeling."
54883,"Hi guys. Serious question. What does it mean to feel like the paper was good, but u get a C for it? Does it mean i am overconfident, and underestimating the paper. Does it mean i am lying to myself and didnt actually study as hard as i thought i did. Does it mean theres so much that i dont know but i thought i did."

I have been regretting that the whole day and as crazy as it seems I'm gonna try here!

I think he boarded at the Faculty of Science, he looks caucasian and was wearing a greenish shirt, standing very close to the front door of the bus before he alighted at Utown.

The weird part is I’ve been feeling powerless in this relationship. It feels like he has been using me to get sexual pleasures of his own and did not respect my wishes that I am uncomfortable doing so at the time being until we get to know each other better. He sometimes say it’s okay with an angry tone when I said I din wanna and in the end I would just listen to him. I felt like I had to compromise my values to suit his desire and it’s so tough for me. This feeling has lasted for three years. It’s been so long since I last smiled happily. What should I do ? "
54873,"Before coming to sg, I had never realised how popular and effed up the instagram culture is,especially for girls. Reading some more about why girls indulge in it and I realised that in this case, its not guys who are pushing them as much as its other girls! It seems like a toxic effed up feedback system that produces and thrives on girls' anxieties about their appearance in the eyes of other girls. I find this quite shocking! How are they not able to resist or ignore this? Are girls THAT vulnerable to something so simple and shallow (but seemingly powerful) as instagram? If so, should I be worried about this if I have a daughter in the future? Maybe this warrants a serious look by girls themselves."
54871,I think that we as a whole need to learn to respect and appreciate  the professors more.

54866,"I shouldn’t even have tried for this position in the first place. Now that I am holding on to this position, with my committee made up of friends I met and made during orientation program, i think being in this committee together sort of affected the friendship between me and ny friends. This is due to the many miscomm, misunderstanding between us during event planning. Plus we are all pretty new to this also. Holding on to this position also affected my studies. Really, I sort of regretted taking up this position. I hope my Comm members are reading this and really hope that they don’t let work related stuff affect our friendship. And also hope they understand that I am struggling with my studies as well amidst of all the planning, which also probably explains how shitty my management was. I might be thinking too much but who knows. I’m someone that bottle things up and doesn’t really voice out or show my true emotions in front of everyone.

I believe your friendship endures beyond physical intimacy and that this relationship was not built on sexual desires. You value it beyond the sexual satisfaction it has given to you. Take the first step of talking about the incident with your friend and ask him how he feels. Assure him that you value the friendship and through the vulnerabilities shared, the friendship will be strengthened on the basis of understanding and empathy.

Even if you find yourself attracted to guys, it is ok. Who says guys can only be attracted to girls. 

All the best and good luck."

Groups exclude me in whatever they do, I don't feel ok to share and I never dare to ask their help since I am afraid I am a burden, but I always try helping in my ability.

(e.g. Even now, I get random epiphanies about something you told me that I now realise was a lie.) 

I hope for your sake that you see through all the unpleasant feelings, and even miraculously, the very fact of that person's toxic and manipulative self dries up even the last bit of affection you have for them, if it hastens your healing. 

I hope that you lean on trustworthy friends during this period, no matter whether you feel like you can do without them or not. I hope you will be honest with your heart, and protect it until it regains tranquility, and that when the door for a close romantic companionship opens for you, it will be the genuine, respectful gentleman you have always deserved and needed!

Like Andy said, it won't be easy to sort things out, but it has to be done. Take care of yourself dear. I wish for you the grace to dance through to the next scene of your life. Jy babe <3 "

  So I'm shocked as it was the first time I'm approached by a guy, and I was nervous and felt weird to talk to a complete stranger. 
  So I rejected his invitation for a meal together, and barely replied his messages.
  Fast forward now, I felt bad for my behavior last time, and am actually keen to know more about him. But its been close to a year since the last message. Should I just pretend this never happend, is it weird if I messaged him suddenly to revive the dinner invitation I rejected?

I understand if checks have to be conducted but is it really necessary to invade the privacy of students like that? We are not prisoners. Even police officers require a warrant before they trespass into your personal space like that. I feel that it really displays hooligan like behaviour for office staff to do that to people. 

 In this AY, they even started conducting checks on EVERY room to see if lights and fans are turned off. Ok we get it, utility bills are high but does that really justify giving you the right to intrude on our space like that. How would you like it if PUB were to go to your house in the middle of the day and just walk into every room to check on your electronics? Do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do unto you.

ALL of you need to seriously reflect on how you run the hall. You are creating such a negative and toxic relationship between students and staff. I believe my complaints are not just applicable to Sheares Hall, but to every other residential places offered by NUS as well. If you wish to implore such draconian measures, maybe you should just run a student prison instead.

You come to hall thinking it is a safe space. Thank you for ruining it, NUS. I implore you, spare a thought for the students for ONCE."

Running in the field, under the hot sun, chasing the small ball with his glove, I don't think I will ever understand why he places so much importance in this pasttime. But I like how happy he smiles when he plays. But at the same time, I know he won't ever place me first, as long as he places his hobby first.

I don't mean in the context of online conversations since these taper out quite naturally but if people have met up or gone on a physical date at least once, why would anyone think that ghosting if they're not interested is a great idea? 

Isn't it basic courtesy to drop a simple text along the lines of: ""Hey, it was nice meeting/hanging out with you but I don't think we would work out romantically. Wishing you all the best!""?

I've never been in a situation to be ghosted before but I've heard of it happening to friends, girls and guys alike, and this phenomenon just seems so puzzling to me.

54821,"There's this girl I've been half in love with for... I don't even know how long now. I say half in love because it's really on and off. Sometimes I think about her all day and night and I go crazy when I don't see or hear from her. Other times I can literally go months like she doesn't exist. And it's not a want someone you can't have thing. She just happens -- No. We just happen to end up in each others' lives at the right and wrong times and it's always only one of us who catches feelings. Never both. We've somehow never been into each other or never allowed ourselves to be into each other at the same time. (God that sounds like some lousy rom-com). We've always been friends and though we sometimes drift further and closer nothing really separates us for long. We just wander back into each others' lives now and again and I never know what to do about that. It's strange that way. And my thoughts and feelings on whether we should get together really go up and down like crazy too. They're worse than the stocks. Once literally within ten minutes I thought about where we'd be in ten years, and then I thought we've got almost zero common principles, and then she looks absolutely gorgeous in that dress, and after that can't she ever disagree openly. Gut feeling tells me she probably thinks and feels something similar  (maybe more or less volatile too)  but lately / as usual I don't think we're both feeling it. It's funny. If I asked her out properly she'd probably say no now and in a couple of months she'd say yes and I'd say no and I'd try again too late and she'd randomly show up again too late and that would keep going on forever. Yeah. I really don't know what to do about that. Probably just focus on finals for now and see what happens.

Oh by the way I'm writing this because I'm reading this psychology book that talks about how it's really important to identify and address feelings and I thought this bit would be good practice. It's this book called Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman. The language is really fluffy and he sounds like a hippie most of the time but it's a got a few decent points and some practical tips for keeping emotions under control and for interacting with other people. Give it a try!

54817,"I look at all these posts about people sharing relationship stories and I feel lucky that you guys have a partner to be with in the first place. I want to share my depression story related to this from back before.

Seeing all of you studying and eating together, holding hands when walking to and from class, lying against each others' shoulders, rarely sneaking a kiss on the other's cheek... I was jealous back then. I had only myself to blame that I was anti-social and could not mingle with others as easily as other people, while many other uni students can just get together like nothing happened. I was really scared of going to school, preferring to stay at home to mug instead of seeing couples in every corner of the school, because it filled me with regret that it's too late. Every other man is good-looking, athletic and knows how to flirt with girls. I am the ugly bastard in a manga, the beta male loser in the society, the chubby guy who will not score any good first impressions from any girl in uni, who prefer more handsome guys.

I began to question myself, where did I go wrong? What are my weaknesses now? Do I even have any qualities? Do I have anything that a girl will notice? Also I read up on what it means to be a boyfriend. Care and concern. Trust. Being there for your girl. Commitment. Most importantly: wanting to have a future with her. Like my friend asked me (before he himself got a gf): ""Why does a girl even want to be with a guy? For support? Why does she need support, if she is the same level of education as you anyway?"" 

Eventually after talking with my friends, I had three things I had to fix. My lack of confidence. Me being too much of a nice guy. And my weight. Not many girls will like a fat guy, being nice to everyone really doesn't have a place in this society, but no girl will ever like a guy who is isn't sure of himself. Guys should be the shoulder the girl leans on, if he is not even confident with himself... he is not confident that he will maintain a relationship with his girlfriend.

My weight now? I admit I have not been working out, sorry. (Tho I am trying to eat less, no carbs etc) But I am trying to work on my confidence with a bit of result. I am still the ugly bastard.... but I just hope my goal to be more presentable to others (and hopefully get a girlfriend) can push me on."
