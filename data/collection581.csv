58196,"#58147 As a girl, sometimes even if I have feelings for a guy, it does not mean that I want to get intimate with him immediately. Some of us just have walls that are harder to tear down. Also, it has only been 2 months so maybe you could give her more time :) Of course, as some people in the comments have said, maybe she is using you as a backup plan. But what if she isn’t and just needs more time? If you truly like her, and if she did mention that she has good feelings for you, try to connect with one another at a deeper level. The physical part can always wait, it’s the most shallow part of a relationship. All the best!! "
58195,"Today when I boarded the bus at Science (around 9.30am-ish), I saw the prettiest girl I had ever seen. She had short hair, wore minimal makeup, and was wearing jeans and a grey+white long sleeved shirt. 

Girl: this guy here wants to ask you out for a coffee! He got stunned badly in the bus just now and just barely recovered.
Everyone else: you gotta help a bro in need - if you know this girl let her know of this post and I'll treat you to a coffee too when I ask here out ;P"
58194,"I used to be anorexic but I recovered. A few weeks ago, someone remarked that I appeared to have put on some weight and that was all it took for me to spiral all the way back into my eating disorder. I've been consuming less than 400 calories a day for the past three weeks. I know its unhealthy at the back of my mind, but I just can't stop. I was 55kg but now I'm at 48kg, yet I have this compulsion to go all the way to 40kg. I just can't stop and I'm embarrassed to ask for help. Once I ask for help, people will see me for that girl with low-self esteem just like I've always been. I hate myself."
58193,"How do you get an A for a module? If it is a module where I see my peers struggling to grasp the concept and I get it, then I can get A. But how about those module where I get it but everyone else seems to be getting it - there is nothing more to ""get"" and everyone seems to get 10/10 for quizzes unless there is a careless mistake. I understand the concepts fully, did all the practice, and I try my best to check the quizzes for mistakes. But everyone does that. What more can I do to get A?"

I am a Y1 EE student. Is it advisable to transfer from EE to CEG, as I am planning to specialise in Computational Intelligence and thought CEG might be more suitable for it.  ( I missed the deadline for transfer exercise in Sem 1 and CEG would be easier to transfer to compared to CS). I am also planning to take CS1010 and CS2040 in SS1 and SS2 respectively if required. Has anyone transferred after Sem 2 before and is it advisable? Or is it better to stay in EE?"
58191,"Why do some girls not wipe their vag after taking a puss? It's so gross. I met a girl in my hall and she wanted to have sex. When I touched her panties, there was a damp patch there. I thought she was really turned on and started getting wet but I smelled it and it was just pee. So disgusting.
I am not asking girls to wipe all the time, maybe just do it when you know you're going to sleep with a guy later."
58190,"#58157 On this work vs study life debate, I dont disagree with OP either. But I dont think we should be generalising this when there's so many various jobs out there.

And on OT, if office hours really ended so late in Singapore, why is our peak hour of crowded MRTs usually at around 6pm and not 8pm+ or 10pm? In fact I hardly see any white collar workers left going home once it turns dark night. Seriously. As a uni student, even I'm coming home later than my parents most of the time these days. Meanwhile I I have a parent that comes home very consistently at 6-7 and he's earning very decent pay. After coming home, he usually just watches Youtube all night.

Is it just nostalgia that has us as working adults missing school life? And on the bright side, you're being paid. You'e earning money, unlike a student instead paying to work. Doesn't that offset whatever extra misery you may think an office job gives?"

58178,"With the FYP deadline coming up soon, I cannot help but to feel worried for it. I have successfully design my product nicely and was supposedly sent for fabrication. The prof asked me to send my design to his lab researcher and so I did and waited for 2 weeks. Then just recently when I sent an email to chase after for my fabricated design, their reply was that the design has not been sent out for fabrication. I am really disappointed because I have wasted 2 weeks waiting. Now Im not even sure whether I can test my design before CA4 approaches. I should really choose one building in NUS and jump down already."

“After all this time?” “Always.”"
58171,"Eczema is a difficult condition to be completely cured from. For me, it was like a whack-a-mole. First it was 2 spots, ultra-strong corticosteroid eliminated one, then another popped up in a different place. After a while, I resumed on the steroid, and the old spot is eliminated, leaving one.

A couple years after that, guess what, a new one. The new spots usually started as a abrasion/wound that somehow ended in an eczema spot. I could control it intermittently with moisturiser and coconut oil. These days I don't like to use those ultra-strong steroids anymore. What I found to work in combination without meds is: drinking vegetable juice (buy a juice and juice a lot of broccoli, kale, cucumber, ginger and lemon), moisturiser, and coconut oil.

And guess what, I inherited the condition. My grandmother on my father's side had it. It skipped my father apparently, then I got it. Do you know that people with eczema has an increased risk of stroke? Guess what other inherited  condition that I have is also known to increase the risk of stroke? Migraine. Got it from my mother.

Then you need to also think of the hygiene hypothesis: that the incidence rate of autoimmune diseases and allergy is increased in the modern world because our environment is ""too clean"".

So in the future, if your child put dirt in his mouth, don't stop him."

58167,"Need some advice. It has almost been a year since I broke up from a really long relationship and since then, I'm just going through my life mindlessly. I know everyone thinks that I am doing well in life but honestly, I just feel so empty. Nothing sparks joy. I also tried talking to the opposite gender but don't really know how to maintain the conversations.   I'm still in NUS too and would like to hear how you guys cope through empty and meaningless times like these."
58166,"I'm very confused about my relationship. We have been together for 2 years but it feels that my gf has changed quite a bit after coming back from exchange. She brushes it off when I joked with her if she is seeing any other guys. But she became resistant to holding my hands after coming back, doesn't kiss me, doesn't visit my family nor ask me to visit hers anymore. She used to do all kinds of stuff for me before she left for her exchange such as writing cards etc and was eager to meet my parents. I can't even recall the last time she messaged me to ask me how I am doing with my work or what I am doing, it's always me asking her how she's doing. I hinted to her on BTO but she ignored it as well. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking, but is this normal for a relationship after passing a few years? I look at my friends with their SOs but they seem very loving. She also changed her profile pic on FB and WA which used to be two of us to just her own photo now. Sigh, I'm really confused. My brain tells me something is off, but my heart doesn't want to believe in it and I don't know how to bring this up to her. "
58165,"Do you all want to know who is the real strawberry generation? I think its the older generation. How many of you have experiences whereby you touched on a raw nerve of some mistake that they did or when your thinking differs from your elders and you try to correct them, they immediately seek shelter and hide behind the strawman argument by saying that you have no respect, you are rude and they will just cut you off and ask u to stay silent. And usually the phrases and words that they use to do so is nothing relevant to the context of the situation and your argument. They resort to louder and authoritative voice because actually they are flustered that you have just opened their can of worms, and so that's why usually they use our generation as a scapegoat, by saying things like ""Nowadays the young people all like that one...etc"" to cover their shortcomings.  

Oh well, because they are too much of a coward to face up to their mistake and accept criticism. They have too much ego in them due to years of ""experience"" and get easily bruised when someone younger than them identify their mistakes. Now, who's the real strawberry here?"

58163,"""The world is never fair, deal with it"". That's what the elites have been inculcating in all of us since young. If we rant about any unfairness that we face, we are seen as whiny, strawberry or weak.

But when there are major screw ups and people start blaming the elites (for eg. NS men deaths, MRT breakdowns in the past, HIV data leak), we will hear phrases like ""Oh, such bashing is not fair to the elites, they have been working so hard..."" 

But didn't the elites taught us before that ""The world is never fair, deal with it""? So, suddenly we need to embrace fairness only when the elites are at fault? "
58162,"Why is society more accepting towards LGBT, but less accepting towards guys who like pretty girls, by thinking that we are superficial. Just like how LGBT ppl can't control the gender that they are attracted to, guys like me also can't control the type of girls that we like. It's all about how your brain is wired to be attracted to certain people. So if going by all the judgmental people's logic, I am superficial because I like girls only because of their appearance, then am I also right to say that LGBT ppl are also superficial because they love someone based on their gender? I'm posting this because people around me have been telling me not to be so picky and judge me for liking girls because of their looks but at the same time they champion for LGBT rights, saying that we should all have the freedom to love who we are attracted to. Huh? Hypocrisy much? "
58161,"this is a rant for me to whine but some profs pronunciations are so off i cannot absorb what they are saying. it is really frustrating and i have to watch the webcasts after the lecture because i did not catch what they are saying in time and then i can't catch up later on in the lecture

for e.g. ""Let X be 0. They are part of the....."" becomes ""let S be geo. Lei are part of le...."" 
this is exacerbated when they do not use the cursor or any laser pointer to point at what they are referencing but instead talk directly. 

oh my god i remember thinking when he said S, he was referring to the summation logo and i could not make out what was being taught. then i realised he was saying X.       ACKS.

58117,I am not sure what to get my bf for this Valentines’. He is currently 24 and working. I got him a messenger bag and face cream last Christmas. He also won a pair of earphones in a recent lucky draw. What should I get for a guy who seems to have everything? Considering between a Fitbit or Apple watch but they are a bit costly. Any opinions? 
58116,"Recently I spoke to my cousins during cny visiting and we were discussing BTO and stuff... So one of them expressed with a tinge of dismay that he would probably never get married. Afterall he's evergreen. There was another cousin who is attached but wants to settle down asap. 

It's normal to feel the pressure to find a gf/bf or settle down especially when you see the people around you gradually hitting these ""milestones"". While it is great to see your friends finding happiness, you should bear in mind that life isn't a competition. It's not about who gets to find a gf or bf first, who gets to settle down first, who gets to have babies first, blah blah blah.

Everyone ""grows up"" at a different pace. My oldest cousin is 37 this year and she just got married. She used to party alot and change bf every few months. No one expected she would eventually settle down. 

In fact I used to party alot too. Encounted a few jerks along the way because I wasn't a ""good girl"" anyway. I've also faced countless rejections because I'm so thick skinned like that. But I don't think our past defines who we are. If there is any way our past could affect us, it only made us stronger than we were. We learn from the mistakes we made and we grow up from there. 

So eventually I got tired of all the aimless partying and toxic relationship drama and started to respect myself and treat myself better. I gave up my old habits and even found someone who thankfully doesn't mind my past. Like what he said, whatever happened in the past belongs in the past, most importantly is who you are right now. 

This is one of my favourite quotes: ""If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.” - Lao Tzu

So, don't let your past define who you are today and don't be in a rush to hit those so called milestones in life. You don't have to be like everyone else. Just be at your own pace ;)
