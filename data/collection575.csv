57599,"I have no clue why I am in CS. 

I frequently find myself thoroughly disinterested in the subject content, and find myself prioritising other faculties' modules over my two CS mods. Even when it comes to lectures, I find myself being able to better follow my other modules, too. At this point I have already no clue what CS2030 and CS2100 are trying to teach. 

Coding feels more like a chore than anything. I want out."
57598,"When I was in year 1, there were 3 cool happy dudes making drinks at biz canteen coolspot. They always greet their customers and sometimes sing happily while making the drinks. Their happiness was infectious.

Now, there's only 1 of the original 3 dudes and he seems really sad everyday. Being a regular customer there for 3 years, I could see the difference. It's really sad, but that's how life is. I really miss the days where they really brought joy to biz canteen. "
57597,To #57448: Were you caring? Cause when people feel their care is one-sided and unappreciated they will back off. But it felt right it probably was and it's just a case of miscommunication. Just talk openly about it and you'll know where you stand

57591,"Why do guys behave differently after having sex with you?

The reason is simple. The sex did not turn out as good as he expected. Could be because he’s a virgin with unrealistic expectations or you weren’t good in bed, etc. For #57574, both reasons could have applied to your context as you both were virgins.

There could be other reasons as well. I once met up with a foreigner through a dating app and we hooked up. The way she made out with me was kinda gross, and being a virgin she was inexperienced, so the encounter was really bad for me. She wanted to meet up again before she fly back but I ghosted her.

A girl friend of mine who did an exchange in Stockholm once told me that “people there are shy... they go for drinks and hook up... if the sex was great, they would date”. That sounded ridiculous to me back then as I was still a virgin but now I can totally relate."

57582,"It's really upsetting when other students or professors assume that Poly students don't learn as much as JC kids.

We poly kids also did research papers (in my poly course, at least), academic writing, projects, presentations, reports and all - for three years? We also had a professional internship, of which we had to apply our skills formally - writing reports and all. So, why is there an assumption that Poly kids don't do as well? If anything, I feel like we honestly deserve some a pat on the back since we worked hard to get here (we needed a really high GPA to enrol into NUS). So, yeah...

57576,"In the darkest hours of my life, I've aways hoped that I can find an accompany, someone to talk to, someone to stay by my side when I struggled to survive each and everyday. I will be so very kind and caring to that person, to trust that him or her deeply; I will love that person with my entire self and life. If I had that someone, my character wouldn't be this terrible and miserable, I might become a totally different man; a man with bountiful softness in heart.

But no, I had no one then. Those grey days when I walked with poverty, despair and suicide plans, I walked alone in great pain, and barely made it to the end at NUS. I paid the price for my foolishness - that is my trust and dependence on the family, well biological ties don't guarantee closeness - and I've, sadly, learnt to be cunning and selfish, to be polite and pretentious, to work for people of all sorts. Now I'm certain that I can take good care of myself, I'm certain that I don't need to beg for mercy from anyone. 

Ironically, with this new found strength from within, I'm becoming more patient and compassionate towards others. My gentle, easy going and ""listener"" attitude seems to have won me more friendliness from people. I've learnt not to comment on emotions and don't eager to offer ""solution"". I'm unwilling to hurt anyone with words, because I unfortunately know the pain. Such is my comedy of life, and tragedy as an individual.

57572,"Why are the comments on NUSWhispers so cynical at times? It's a platform where people can say things that they may not have the courage to say in real life or where people just wants to say something where more people will read. No need to shoot them down or say ""Ask here for what"". Some comments are genuinely not helpful or so generalizing."

57570,"#57560 Today's Monday, aka the week has just started, so idk what you're talking about missing shuttle buses for the past week when it's just been a day? 

Next on the issue of missing the buses, there are quite a few methods to get to anywhere on campus actually so if plan A fails, there's always plan B or C. Although they may not be as direct as your initial plan, it'll definitely get you to your destination sooner than waiting for the 2-3 buses

If you're taking about  the morning peak hour from 9.45-10am or 11.45-12pm, I'd suggest that you either up your squeezing game to board the bus, or leave the house earlier. There's definitely no way for them to arrange enough shuttle buses to accommodate everyone should we all decide to arrive at the same time. Afterall, humans are selfish by nature and will only care about our individual wellbeing so it'll boil down to whether you prefer sleeping in more or boarding a less crowded bus 

It's also not true that they've done nothing about the shuttle bus issue as I feel that there's been a couple of changes this sem. In the evenings, it seems as though they've increased the frequency of A2 (at the expense of A1 if I may add) to cater to the larger number of staff and students that go home at this time. While it's been slightly inconvenient if you're taking A1, I feel that the office in charge is slowly improving and doing their best within the monetary constraints and having enough drivers during this peak period, and hence do deserve some credit for this actually

In addition, he also mentioned ‘aiya you think poly kids smarter than JC kids meh?’ when his female friend asked whether JC kids can enrol there.

Sure you made it to nus, you must be the cream of the crop. Except your 3.9 cap barely makes the cut, maybe you should be more humble when it comes to bragging rights.

57561,"I'm not sure if if others feel the same way about sex before/after marriage. I vehemently disagree that sex should only occur after marriage, as it is putting it on a very high pedestal that imo is unwarranted. Neither do I agree that sex is necessary before marriage, like ""it's an important part of growing up"" etc. 

My take is that it should simply be viewed as a basic instinct shared with other animals. I simply do not think sex should be glorified as something sacred to only occur after marriage. Just like we don't necessarily glorify all our meals. Perhaps it could be said that I am more or less alright with premarital sex, but more for the fact that it shouldn't be regarded as some sort of 'holy thing'."

57557,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year now. We are sexually active and have sex around 3 times a week. Whenever we have sex, I will cum into her mouth and she will swallow my semen. I have this habit that I need to fap everyday (unless I had sex with her that day), so on days that we don’t have sex, I will need to fap myself. However, whenever I fap into a tissue, I feel like my cum is wasted and could have been swallowed by my gf instead. Hence I decided to collect my semen in a small container to keep it for my gf. I make sure it is well kept in the freezer so that it is safe for consumption. Lately, the small bottle became more than half filled and I decided it was time to bring it to my gf for her to swallow at once. She initially refused to do it citing health concerns but after I pleaded with her to do so, she agreed to drink it. However, my gf started vomiting and now has a fever of around 39 degrees. It’s been 2 days and the fever is still not subsiding. We decided not to go to the doctor in case they find out what we did. What should we do? "
57556,"The CFG 2MC module was both useful and useless at the same time. Useful because you *might* plan your 4 years better and get a job when/after (or in some cases, before) you graduate.
Useless because some of the things that were taught is not for everyone. I get that we do have to package/market our-selves/skills/capabilities but sometimes I feel that some are really going a bit too far, like, just being plainly Pretentious.

It’s actually a good initative to try to prepare students to be career-ready, but perhaps it could be structured better (as the saying goes, there’s always room for improvement).

What are your views on this?"
57555,"I’m a Year 1 student in FASS and yeah ppl were (and some still are) telling me that I should choose a major I like, something I have interest in, and don’t think too much about the career prospects.
But therein lies a problem, I am interested in a lot of the academic disciplines offered by FASS.
I have taken modules in Political Science, Philosophy, Southeast Asian studies and am now taking modules in History and English linguistics. I’m also interested in Sociology, Global studies, Japanese studies, European studies, and maybe Chinese studies/linguistics (but not necesarily as someone who would major in them). I am almost hitting the 60-MCs limit for 1k mods.
So what would you say to someone who has such varied interests? So I might turn out to be a “jack-of-all-trades, master of none” in the end (not that it is necessarily a bad thing; it could be a boon rather than a bane).

The most important motivation for me even applying to FASS in the first place is its offer of a wide variety of academic disciplines, flexibility, and expertise (given that it’s the most established - among the universities in Singapore at least). This is a real dilemma for me. FASS differs from all other faculties or schools in its “buffet” of subjects as compared to a one/two-course meal (occasionally with appetizers) of Science/Business (for example)."

57552,"#57541 some mother in laws are a bit cranky and crazy. You should do a risk benefit analysis. How much inheritance you get to gain, how handsome is your boyfriend.

Also consider your boyfriend wishes, after marriage same house or live separately. Also consider your future father in law character. Is he able to control your future mother in law tantrums. Is he reasonable. If both are bad, then run as far as you can. Honestly a bad mother in law can make your life totally miserable.

Anyway your bf is not oblivious to it. In fact he is aware, and pretend to act blur, and on his mum side.

Short of a good inheritance or a very handsome boyfriend, the costs are far too great. For your emotional sanity.

Yes I agree the info is quite ambiguous and unclear.
There is (or at least used to be) a senior intake programme for undergraduates to RCs but apparently the RCs has not taken in any non-freshmen undergraduates in the past few semesters and it's not clear if they would ever do that again in the foreseeable future (highly unlikely but do check the Utown websites for updates regularly if you are really keen on going to the RCs in Year 2!).

But anyway I'm not really sure if there actually had been undergraduates who got into the RCs in their Y2 of studies (although the website did mention the 1-year RC programme). In any case it would likely have been a small group of fortunate ones. 

If anyone actually did manage to enter RC in Year 2, do share any anecdotes/stories/experiences that might provide clarity!"

57526,"I just watched the video on Aloysius Pang's funeral. 

It's an extremely sad occasion. I cannot imagine how devastated his family members are, his loyal friends and loving colleagues. Yes, it may seem unfair that he receives so much more attention and media coverage as a celebrity compared to similar (or worse) death incidents of average citizens/foreign workers. 

But a death is still profoundly grievous, regardless of who it happens to be.  

But I'm shocked and angry - how do the hundreds who went to see him off for the last time have the shameful audacity to stand right in front of the car carrying the coffin, snapping fervently away on their phones from all angles? 

This is the only time when his loved ones can try their hardest to obtain emotional closure. A proper farewell is absolutely essential to adapt and recover from grief. 

His funeral is not an exhibition. His funeral is not a quirky event to attend so you can say that you went. His funeral is a ceremony meant for actual grieving, commemorating and reckoning the mortality of all of us. This is the same for every other funeral.

Unfortunately, i also caught a segment of the video whereby a woman actually smiled sheepishly when being asked to make space for moving vehicles. Like a child's playful glee when he's caught misbehaving. There are those dressed in lurid colors - bright red, yellow, pink, orange - almost rudely oblivious to the sombre waves of black, grey and occasionally white all around them. 

Some even peered into the car. What are you looking for? Attention? 

The vapid urge to publicize anything and everything on social media as a testimony to your life is toxic.

I never understood the logic of posting pictures on social media for solemn events like funeral. The whole process of having to take, crop, edit the pictures and write captions to mourn the dead... It trivialises the eternal loss of an individual.

Often I see my friends sharing with one another other about their relationship woes, only to set aside these sadness in them and reconcile their emotions and get on with their lives again. And often so, they will be hurt over and over again emotionally, because they tend to assess things with their feelings rather than logic. 

I have come to understand that as we devote ourselves into relationships, feelings supersedes logic at many instances. And if we decide to get into relationships based on feelings, rather than mutual understandings, then why are we logically telling ourselves that we should find someone who is truly good to us, only to revert to being someone who settles based on our feelings? 

I just feel that one should commit into a relationship based on an admiration for someone's positive traits and acceptance of their negative traits, before really tapping into our feelings bank.
