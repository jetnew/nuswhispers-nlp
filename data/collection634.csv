63499,"I am a graduating Y4 engineering student. I am having bad luck finding a job. It seems that employers favours NTU engineering over NUS. May I know why? I was under the impression that both schools are accredited and of similar standing?

63494,"There’s some form of hypocrisy going on, and I wonder if people mean what they say or....?

The people who like to take Instagram of their coffee and always say “i love coffee!!!” Or “can’t live without coffee” always drink only 1 cup of coffee. They don’t drink much coffee, but call themselves “coffee lovers”. 

On the contrary, the real people who are drinking 5 cups of coffee a day like their lives depended on coffee, don’t call themselves “coffee lovers” and they don’t even even post their coffee online. 

With the same $7, the “coffee lovers” consume ONE cup of overpriced fancy coffee and stop.  The real ones who are really attracted to coffee take the same $7 and buy 5 cups of kopi Beng and drink them all.....

Also, the people who are so enthusiastic about going to try new cafes and restaurants are, ironically, the same people who have small appetites. They move away from the food by pushing half the plate away: they don’t even finish eating. 

And just like coffee, the people who never Google cafes, and never say “I love food so much!”, all have large appetites and finish the leftovers REJECTED by “food lovers”. 

Who are the ones who reject and push food away? “Food lovers”. Who are the ones who reject and push coffee away? “Coffee lovers”. 

Who are the ones who don’t consume much of coffee and food? The ones who “love” them! 

People say “women love food, they can’t resist cravings”. And people also say “women have lower caloric needs and their stomachs are smaller so they eat less”. Which is really slapping yourself in the face."

63489,"I have a crush on this guy and I know he likes me back too, but the thing is I’m going to Australia for 2 years to study real soon. We both agree that we can not do LDR and should remain friends for now. Despite knowing we’ve made the most suitable decision, but somehow a part of me feels really sad and empty. I don’t know if I’m imagining things, but I feel like he’s been trying to avoid me lately, like reply slower and colder than usual. I also don’t know how to maintain long distance friendship, since he’s a really busy guy so I’m kinda scared that I will unintentionally bother him with my texts and he will be annoyed."
63487,"With regards to the previous post where the pp brought up a good point about generalising statements... it’s how you say it in a debate/argument. When one mentioned about how ‘singaporean girls are more princessy’ i don’t think the person realised that this kind of statement is generalising the whole population. It’s like saying ‘asians have small eyes’ and expecting those with big eyes (there are a lot, not just a tiny minority) to not be triggered. 

Point is, try rephrasing the way you word your point of views. It’s easy as a minority to feel attacked when someone generalises something about your sub-population which may not be entirely true. If you’re gonna pull the ‘oh it’s because you’re so sensitive’ card, just think about it for a moment. All these are examples of over-generalisation: Malay ppl like to sit one corner lepak. Indian ppl are creepy. Think send bobs and vagines. Black people? Criminals. White people? Probably entitled. Chinese from china? Loud. Female? Weak. Male? Strong and doesn’t cry. So please, before you convey your opinion. Please think about whether your words are accurate. This post is not to attack anyone, it’s to hopefully improve the way we discuss."
63486,"Friend A and B are both close friends of mine and the 3 of us were always together. They drifted apart however and had some misunderstandings for a few years. I thus tried to pull them together again by organising meetups etc and things were good again. Then shortly after, I left for exchange and A started asking B out a lot during this period, introducing her to all her other circles. At first, I was happy for them and didn't think much about it. However even when I came back to SG, they continued doing so (hanging out with their new mutual friends) without inviting me. Both of them are really close now and would often exclude me when they hang out every week. I feel quite betrayed because I was the one who pulled them together yet they are excluding me. Would like to know what you guys would do in my situation."
63484,"This is regarding the topic of paying for girlfriends.

Ladies, if you truly loved your boyfriend you wouldn't bear to let him face the financial burden of 2 people while hoarding the money you earn/get for yourself. That is straight up taking advantage of the male.

Nice boyfriends offer to pay, nice girlfriends refuse the offer if it is unnecessary."
63483,"I have been living with an abusive brother since young. He has various episodes of going crazy, during which he throws and damages the house furniture (but always carefully avoiding his own possessions) and attacks me and my mum. When my dad is around, he is able to control his craziness and he does not beat my dad. These episodes are always triggered by me somehow. E.g. if he is bullying me and he gets scolded, he goes crazy that I caused him to get scolded. This has taken a great emotional and mental toll on my whole family for over a decade.

While his condition has improved greatly after he found a girlfriend, he continues to do selfish things, for instance, picking out my laundry, eating food which does not belong to him and etc. He went crazy again and spoilt my mum’s built in wardrobe because he was upset about being confronted for picking out my laundry. tldr: he feels that it is everyone else’s fault but his own. 

What can I do to help myself, and my parents? Really exhausted."

63480,"Hi Applied Math seniors! I need help between choosing specialisations (ORFM or MMDA).

Personally, I'd prefer doing ORFM because I guess foresee myself going into Operations Research and stuff but I also know that there is a greater demand for data analysts/people with data analytical skills. How would an MMDA specialisation help me?

Perhaps, if anyone can also share the kind of job prospects both specialisations may offer that would be great too!"

63473,"I am the guy from #63473 again.
But hey this is a different issue now. So by brilliant girl as I have shared, broke up with me over phone/text half way around the world when she start her summer 'exchange' last week. Previously we planned a trip together where I was supposed to fly over and meet her. She booked some of the air bnbs on my account for first time code and I bought her domestic flights. Since the break up I have not spoken to her, but now shes back asking me for the booking confirmation and flight details. 
I just wanted to have a public opinion on this. Is it rude and unfathomable for me to have cancelled the air bnbs on my account and the flights as well since we have broken up and I am not going. I am not even going to ask her to refund me for my other flights/ferry/bookings etc. Or is this being too mean to her."
63471,"Anyone else get super annoyed by e-scooter users? There's been a number of accidents happening due to errant users but regulatory action is still underwhelming. 

Whenever those goons ride past me at blistering speed (and beats me why people can get injured because of them right), it's so bloody tempting to give them a punch. Added bonus of a second punch if they're accompanied by some party music and light show (who says singapore is not a vibrant city).

But I can't cave in to such temptation. Don't want to end up with a record that jeopardise my career (yet those goons can swerve around jeopardising people's lives). 

If only Iron Man's little finger wiggle could have erased those goons too (they're equally as disdainful as Thanos, on second thought, it's quite an insult comparing them to Thanos). Sorry for the spoiler to those who still have not watched."
63470,"All this angst over long or short hair misses the big picture that it is about knowing what you want and choosing while being aware about the tradeoffs.

Most guys are hardwired to find long hair in girls attractive (you can google the studies yourself), any girl who cuts her hair short immediately loses a good amount of points in the dating marketplace with a large percentage of the opposite gender. This can be made up for in other areas of course, but you will have to work harder to compensate.

Obviously attracting guys isn't the only thing in the world and you are entitled to do whatever you want with your hair, just that one needs to be informed about the tradeoffs and not get surprised or salty there is a price to pay. 

It is not reasonable to demand that guys find you equally attractive when you do something they will find unattractive. No amount of salt will change what guys find physically attractive. Real attraction cannot be bargained. 

It's similar to a guy choosing to be overweight because it's easier and more practical expecting that girls should be every bit as attracted to him as when he was fit. He will be laughed at as a loser. It's not going to happen. Nuff said."

63456,"Ok, I'm fine with only men serving NS. But come on, however you look at it, men lose 2 years out of a potential ~40+ years of their career. So why not simply adjust the tax rate (at all brackets) up 2.5% for women (and men who don't serve NS for whatever reason) and down 2.5% for men? Tbh this still favours women because losing 5% of your career duration also means you also lose the progression and this compounds over the course of a long career, but we can overlook that for now.

63443,"I'm a NUS student who is returning to Singapore from exchange soon, and want to seek some relationship advice. I've recently met another Singaporean girl during my stint here, and I think I've fallen for her pretty hard. I'm honestly not sure if she feels the same - although we text quite a lot almost everyday and meet up pretty often too. We are both attached, and we are both aware of each other's relationship status.

Each time I see her, I can't help but have mixed feelings. On one hand, I have experienced a sense of joy I’ve never felt before as she's the sweetest and kindest girl I've ever met, and we are similar in so many ways.  On the other hand, I feel so guilty towards my current girlfriend in Singapore, whom I have had few issues with throughout the whole relationship (which has lasted for a few years). I know I should probably stop texting this new girl less, but I can't seem to control myself.

I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do now - should I consider confessing to this new girl and risk jeopardizing this friendship? Also, regardless of how this turns out, how should I handle my current relationship? My girlfriend loves me a lot and is extremely dependent on me, and I can't bear to tell her that I've cheated (emotionally) on her since another girl has been on my mind for the past few months."

He felt like I didn’t consult him on matters and didn’t care about his opinion and shit. He said I knew that he loves long hair, and I did know, but chose to ignore his wishes and cut short my hair. Boy was angry for a whole week and wanted a short break from me to rethink things. Lol sure. But short hair was liberating, comfortable, and cool. The best decision I’ve made my whole life. I told him honestly that I don’t think I’m  going  back to long hair. We made up 2 weeks later with him going passive aggressive on me about my hair despite people telling me I look great. It’s  my body, my hair, im sure I can do whatever i Want with it. And yeah he broke up with me saying I was too opinionated and too feminist for him. It was pretty funny looking back. Glad I cut off my hair along with that pillock. It’s true we had other problems but the hair was the trigger of it all."
63435,"In response to #63395: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/63395
Pretty much in the same position as you as I'm studying overseas. Honestly never thought about relationships even though I knew I would have a family of my own someday (somehow). I literally didn't bother socialising much because some people were pretty superficial (academics, gym, investments etc were my top priorities). 
It was only when my housemates asked me about dating and marriage in general, which made me realise that I needed “experience” – dating experience, to discover what kind of person I’m looking for, how people behaved during dates, dos and don’ts, how to sustain a conversation etc. Trust me, I’m pretty introverted by nature as well, which didn’t help since I was very skinny as well last time, so I mainly focused on a variety of self-improvement (study hard, do stuff you enjoy, read more books). Now, some of my friends are even surprised that I’m still single despite taking care of my physique and having pretty ok grades.
Similar to you, I’m looking for someone from Singapore - similar values/upbringing etc., and so I started using tinder/CMB (CMB better imo) to meet new people whenever I'm back in SG. I've had good and bad dates/meetups, and I feel that only after having your fair share of good and bad dates will you realise what kind of person you’re looking for. Obviously all chats start off with topics such as hobbies, then you can ask about what they do for leisure, overseas exchange programmes (cooking and living alone etc, places they’ve visited – share pictures and stuff), how they view relationships (perhaps ask why they’re not attached etc.), why did they choose that degree/job position, what gets them up in the morning, their goals and dreams etc. If they’re someone who has pretty similar goals, go and ask them out to find out more about them.
As for group hangouts, you can always sit beside someone you’re interested in, get to know them through small talk etc. (can’t say much about that since I mainly use dating apps) – maybe can ask Jonathan Choi (11/10 solid advice).
My advice for you is to either sign up for NUS events, or just do it the simpler way - dating apps. I ALWAYS got awkward around females, especially when my housemates invited them over for drinks and stuff, but it is through these “failures” that you know how to spark conversations with random people. The more you are put in situations like these, the less awkward you will feel – similar to public speaking (I had mad jitters whenever I had to do those last time, now it’s pretty chill for me). 
I wish you all the best, and don’t dig into the mentality of “oh, I’m awkward as shit etc.”, just go out and try. Many a time we overthink and end up doing nothing. If it helps, just think of it as going out and making friends first – with males and females. Who knows, they might even introduce you to a potential someone."

63429,"I lost her.

Years ago, I met her. Her bubbly personality first caught my attention. She was fun-loving, she placed others first, and she made me so happy. I came with a whole ton of insecurities after my ex cheated on me, and having a scandalous past. She knew, she accepted. She would stay up late at night just to accompany me when I can't sleep.  She would travel to the opposite ends of sg to meet me. She takes care of me when I'm sick. She gets me my favorite food when I'm down.
We got together some time after. But I've always allowed my insecurities to get the better of me. I would doubt her, all the time. I would shout at her. I let my ego and pride take priority whenever we quarrelled. I told her she is selfish, ugly. I called her awful names. I spent lesser time with her, I stopped becoming observant to her needs. She never requested for anything extravagant, anything materialistic. She was easily contented. All she wanted was my time and to have her favorite ice cream with me. I've never bought her anything, I've never bought her flowers. As I met new friends, I talked to her lesser and lesser. I blamed her for everything bad that happened to me. In one of our arguments, I told her I'm better off without her. I pushed her. She fell and hurt herself. I didn't help her up. I continued shouting at her. I stopped caring.She was bleeding. She cried, looking at me. Not with any hint of resentment, but with eyes of disappointment. Before she left, she told me she love me very much. Fast forward, she is together with someone new, and she just seem so happy. I'm happy for you, and I'm sorry I didn't love you better."
63428,"Hi,
I am an international full-time student who has been living in Singapore for 3 years. I still remember how much excited to start the freshmen year, how I looked forward to a new life in Singapore. But now, my final year has approached, and I just find myself less and less happy.
I had my first love during high school when I was still in my hometown. He was a sweet, nice and smart guy. I one-sided him since my secondary school, and coincidentally we came to the same high school, then he asked me to be his girlfriend when I turned 17. We broke up 2 years later because he chose England for his dream while I, as the eldest daughter, didn't want to move too far away from my parents, that's why I came to Singapore. I’m not sure but since then, never a moment of my life, I actually enjoyed being here. 
My friends around always just care about their grades, there is no one I can consider as a friend in need, or simply, someone I can look for in my contact and press the number when I am in troubles. The girl friends always talk about appearance, or other girls they hate, or their crushes. The guy friends always seem to be desperate for girls, keep talking about their profiles on dating apps, or money, or games. They are all somehow judgmental, materialistic, and always complain. I never really share a thoughtful conversation, or you know, a kind of conversation that you feel like, at least there is somebody who can understand you. 
It’s been 3 years and I still yet can't adjust to Singapore, to whatever Singapore really is. Maybe because I come from a third-world country, maybe I just always heard friends asking the only thing about my country “is it dangerous? Will we die there?”, maybe I used to live in a place where we didn’t have electricity, and Internet, maybe I saw a lot of people who were homeless, under poverty in my country. I don’t know.
I missed my teenage back then in my country, where I loved and received love. Here I am always alone, just alone. I went out with guys and came to some meetups. I thought there would be someone for me, but in the end I realized I was just one of the fish in their net, you know, like “c’mon, you’re 20s, why being so serious?”. Well, am I the only being serious? 
“Just go back, if you hate Singapore?” The only thing I would hear when I actually told some friends about my loneliness here. I don’t hate Singapore, I just wonder why Singapore is so unhappy? I met some friends who seem to be caring, I talked to the cleaners who offered me a drink even they earned only $800, I met the girl in 7-11 who also had the same story as me. I wish we can see Singapore good not in a way of an Asian Dragon, but in the people, in love. 
I have become more and more depressed, more and more timid, more and more uncomfortable with socializing. I am afraid someday soon I will regret of putting so much effort to be here, of my past decision, of ending up losing myself. I already feel I am getting near to that."
63425,"Regarding the “guy pay for meal” topic, I think everyone is missing the point. The anguish is NOT on whether guy should pay or should not pay. Instead, the anguish is about the mismatched attitude from girl. Allow me to explain what I mean. 

There are 2 types of guys, and each of them have their own advantages and disadvantages:

1. Guys who pay majority of expenses (aka. Traditional guys)

Advantage - pay for girls (be it meal, flight, hotel, diamond right, wedding etc) because he feels he is the man and he should provide security and it is manly and gentlemanly to do all these things.

Disadvantage - tend to be more bossy and demand obedience from girls. Also expect the girl to cook and do household chores, run the family while he work. Take care of kids and parents. 

The grounding for this type of guy is chivalry. He will protect his girl fiercely and shelter her relentlessly, but also expect girl to listen to him, be demure and be his helper and take care of the family.

2. Guys who split half half (aka modern guys)

Advantage - doesn’t expect girl to take care of family solely. Will share the burden of work. Emphasis gender equality, less authoritative. Woman have more say in decision making. 

Disadvantage - Portrayed as “not man” enough. Not gentlemanly. Deemed to be calculative (eg. Dispute over who pay meal), 小心眼, 不大气 and 小男人 (aka insecure man). 

The grounding for this type of guys is fairness and equality. He will treat his girl fairly with justice, yearn to build a collaborative and team oriented family with no hierarchy. But he will also never ever shortchange himself which can be seen as petty, uncaring, unpampering to the girl. 

I’m ok with both types of guys. The KEY is that they have both pro and cons. Neither is better than the other and it all boils down to your preference. 

However the disaster and anguish occur when female (especially Singaporean girls) have fantasy expectation of boyfriend, which is simply taking the advantageous points of both types of guy and forbid the disadvantage points:

Fictional boyfriend that sg girls expect:

pay for girls (be it meal, flight, hotel, diamond right, wedding etc) because he feels he is the man and he should provide security and it is manly and gentlemanly to do all these things.

doesn’t expect girl to take care of family solely. Will share the burden of work. Emphasis gender equality, less authoritative. Woman have more say in decision making. 

CANNOT BE bossy and demand obedience from girls. Also CANNOT expect the girl to cook and do household chores, run the family while he work. Take care of kids and parents. 

CANNOT BE portrayed as “not man” enough or not gentlemanly. CANNOT be calculative (eg. Dispute over who pay meal), 小心眼, 不大气 and 小男人 (aka insecure man). 

And what’s gonna be the guy’s grounding in this case? It’s obvious... Treat my girl as a goddess and do whatever to please her, let her extract and exploit me all in the name orb love. Aka. Be her slave! 

I think that’s the crux of the resentment and anguish: girls wanting to eat the cake and have it at the same time. Selectively picking for good points and criticize bad points without realizing all the pro and cons come as a package. 

When she has a traditional guy, she compare the traditional guy’s disadvantage to a modern’s advantage (taking the traditional guy’s advantage for granted and oblivious to the modern guy’s disadvantage.) 

So there you go... TLDR: Crux of the problem is girls having fictional fantasy of imaginary boyfriend material! 

But fret not guys.. once girl hit 30, they will grow up and wake up from their fantasy and the table will turn :)"

And consumerism is killing our Earth faster anyways so why not considering to slow down our planet's eventual demise to man-made climate change? ~ 27 years old software developer (you should probably take my words as a pinch of salt anyways)"
63416,"Just an advice for people who shares about them unable to find jobs after graduation (or unable to find a new job): maybe you should share a bit more specific about yourself like what your qualification is, what experience you had (internship or freelance or previous jobs...), what your passions are, etc. 
I mean NUSWhispers is not a job search service but people here would definitely give better advices or even give you some career opportunities if you share a bit more details about yourself :)"
63412,"What are some reasons that you fail an interview that you are willing to accept?

Here are some reason that I can think of:

1)Due to company restructuring, the job opening was closed down
2)The salary the company could offer was unreasonably low, and the interviewer felt that they shouldn't short change you.
3)The interviewer wanted a student from another course in which case they shouldn't even have invited you for an interview."
63411,"Is it just me or other people also think Singapore guys are very much immature and behave childishly? When I entered NUS, I am rather surprised by how guys behave especially that they have gone through army and should have matured through that tough 2 year period. Yes they may have matured physically with big muscles to show and all but their thinking remains much like a teenager. Many guys I've talked to can't hold an intelligent conversation, have a very narrow worldview and limited knowledge of current affairs. They often don't have their own opinions and follow others' and are easily angered by well meaning advice or small criticisms. Some even keep relying on parents on simple things like what healthy food choices to eat and how to spend their money wisely. This is in sharp contrast to people I've met overseas. They are much more independent and outspoken and some even have successful careers or businesses in their early 20s. What could have caused this issues in Singapore?"
63410,"To end this debate about guy's paying for girl's etc.

To guys: Don't be a miser. Yes it's your own money, but you can show your love or even a nice gesture to pay for a meal or to buy gifts (within your own means). The right girl won't care about how much you spend on her but obsessing over money will sour a relationship because a girl doesn't want to be viewed as another thing you spend money on.

To girls: You aren't entitled squat. Stop thinking a guy owes you a meal or gifts, even if they have the means to do so. It's his money, he can do what he likes with it. If you want money for your time you spend, go get a job. If you specifically want money from guys, go into prostitution.

This isn't anything to do with the gender wage gap debate. This is basic manners, and common sense. The same would hold true if the genders were reversed i.e. guy's aren't entitled to girl's money, and girl's should be able to spend on their boyfriend's within their limits.

If y'all aren't like this, it doesn't apply to you."
63408,"Looking at #63408, my ex boyfriend threw a hissy fit when I cut short my hair. Like really short, pixie cut. He said he felt like he was dating a man. (Seriously.) He felt like I didn’t consult him on matters and didn’t care about his opinion and shit. He said I knew that he loves long hair, and I did know, but chose to ignore his wishes and cut short my hair. Boy was angry for a whole week and wanted a short break from me to rethink things. Lol sure. But short hair was liberating, comfortable, and cool. The best decision I’ve made my whole life. I told him honestly that I don’t think I’m  going  back to long hair. We made up 2 weeks later with him going passive aggressive on me about my hair despite people telling me I look great. It’s  my body, my hair, im sure I can do whatever i Want with it. And yeah he broke up with me saying I was too opinionated and too feminist for him. It was pretty funny looking back. Glad I cut off my hair along with that pillock. It’s true we had other problems but the hair was the trigger of it all."
63407,"For the boyfriend who doesnt celebrate anniversaries, or birthdays, or even weekends. For the boyfriend who doesnt make concrete steps towards our future. For the boyfriend who makes me play “third fiddle” after this family and career. I am trying to be ok with this arrangement. I dont know what I see in you. Seems like I have made the decision to lose the whole of myself to exchange for a small part of you."
63406,"A few months before I left Singapore for my exchange programme, I met a guy and got into a relationship with him. However, as time passed by, I realised that he is not the one I will like to have a long term relationship with, because of our fundamental differences in our goals in life. I don't think I can accept him as a marriage partner.

As I am still overseas now, I will like to ask what is the best method of breaking up?

In a way, I don't wish to waste his time by breaking up with him only when I'm back (few more months to go). Then again, I feel that breaking up in person seems more respectful.

Has anyone taken EC1101E without studying Econs back in JC? May I know how did you made it thru the mod?
I've literally no foundation in Econs and pretty bad Math skills but I became interested in economics after year 1.

63404,"This is a response to the topic on if guys should pay for meals etc. 

I was once like many native guys here, thinking why shouldn’t ladies pay as well (sometimes la). 

Then I met her. She didn’t insist me on paying and is more than happy to pay her share during dates, ( although she now admits that we would never gotten married if I were stingy). 

So what started a change in me? Did I become woke?
No I became awaken to a simple truth: she is worth it and I would do anything to make her happy and keep her by my side forever. 
That included paying for almost everything (despite her insisting not). 

The crux of this issue is simple, it’s never about money. It’s about value. She is invaluable to me. I responded in a way only men do to ladies invaluable to them. 

When I had about $1k left in my account, I spent $600 on a diamond bracelet for our anniversary. I felt happy. Of course I had my pay coming soon but that wasn’t the point. She was touched, because she knew at that point of time, I didn’t have much but I was still willing to spend on her. 

So to the boys (not men, I don’t view many of u as men yet), have you ever asked yourselves why there are men willing to pay for their lady almost all the time? Why TF are they spoiling the market? Why make you look bad in comparison? 

The answer is simple AF. One day you will find a lady who is invaluable to you. You will realize you will do anything to keep her by your side. Money is never the focus but her value in yr heart is. When you do find such a lady and are prepared to say your vows to her for marriage, your native mindsets will be broken and you will emerge a man, ready to do anything for her. 

TLDR: If a guy don’t man TF up and behaves in a way that responds to how much a lady means to you, you will lose her. 

You will lose her to another man who values her more than 6x her salary but will to give 10x more than you would ever do.

To the ladies: behind every guy who doesn’t value you the way you deserve, there’s always more guys who are more than willing to treat you better."
63403,"Quick poll, you have $2000 - would you go on an overseas trip with your friends for 2 weeks? Or would you save that money so you can go for ""smaller"" outings (lunches, dinners, movies, carnivals, events) in Singapore over a span of perhaps a year? 

See, I have been asked multiple times why I do not go overseas with my friends, and while a big concern is money, the underlying concern is simply what else I could use the money for. Back when I had ORD-ed, I burned through some of my savings, spending $3,500 to go on two overseas trips (the total duration was about a month) with two separate group of friends. When I came back, I had to be a bit calculative (I did not plan to find a job before Uni and understandably did not have that much to rely on) so I had to skip some of the subsequent outings especially when it involved either overexpensive experiences (MBS staycation) or the more distant friends (sadly). When I entered Uni, I realized I had almost lost contact with 1 group that I had went overseas with, despite at that time, enjoying myself and seeing a new part of the world for myself. The other group was not that close but because we still meet due to circumstances, we are still at least acquaintances (hi bye friends I guess). Thing is, I ended up being closer to people I had chosen to gone out with on frequent, but cheaper lunches and dinners or just to check out the new ""in thing"" in Singapore (like that carnival near MBS?)

Of course some people might say that's obvious. But I really treasure the friendships I have formed. In fact, I daresay I would trade my experience overseas to spend more time with friends, to get to know them better, or let them know me better. Did we really drift off because we were not alike? Or did my choices (influenced by financial matters) do this? I am definitely not poor, I could do these things (and in a way I chose to do these things) because my family is stable enough that I did not need to  opt for a full time job before Uni (in fact I only worked at one event job and relied on my savings the rest of the time). Finances may have definitely been a factor, but I am just curious, would a new experience to see a new country really be worth the little moments you spend with friends? What do you guys think?"
63402,"My (unpopular) opinion: being a woman is a blessing.

Does anyone else feel the same way as me? *curious*

I have female friends who feel that it is tougher to be a woman than it is to be a man and I simply cannot relate to them.

I'm a female in my 20s. Growing up, I never had to worry about anything in life. I have doting parents and brothers who took care of everything for me and I'm very thankful for them.

My parents had minimal expectations for me but their expectations for my two brothers were unreasonably high. While it's considered a major disappointment if my brothers fail at something, my failures and mistakes were often easily forgiven.

And while my brothers already stopped receiving allowance since graduating, my dad still insists on paying for my bills and giving me supplementary cards even after I've graduated.

I also have a few male cousins who would spend their parents' money occasionally but receive criticism for doing so. On the contrary, I've never been criticised for spending my parents' money.

I dated a few guys before and though I've always offered to pay during dates, my kind gestures were always turned down by them. Although I could afford to pay for everything, these guys still felt like it was an obligation to pay for me.

I had this ex-boyfriend who insisted on paying for everything because he felt that he should take care of me. I was never expected to fork out a single cent. As a result, I always avoided shopping and dining at expensive places.

Whenever some of my friends complain about their boyfriends' unwillingness to spend on them, I would feel very confused. Like why would my friends expect their bf to pay for them when they are fully capable of doing so? 

And sometimes you hear people talk about couples where the wife earns way more than the husband. In such cases, the husband would be deemed less capable. And if the husband is less educated, the wife would be deemed as compromising herself. The reverse would often be more acceptable. 

Although my ex holds an MSc and earned more than me, he and his family didn't mind that I'm just an average uni grad. On the contrary, my uni friend's bf, who didn't go to uni, isn't well received by her family. 

Sometimes I feel like it's so tough being a guy. Why do we expect so much of guys? Why do we expect them to be manly/strong/chivalrous/competitive/ambitious/successful? Why are they not allowed to fail/to make mistakes/to be vulnerable/to just be themselves?

And why do some women complain that it's tougher being a woman and assume that being a man would be easier? 

Alright, I know being a woman can also be very tough but I certainly don't think that being a man can be any easier. 

No matter what, we should just be thankful for each other and appreciate each other's unique strengths and personalities. And maybe let go of these expectations."
63401,I lost my NRIC (Sxxxx525F) on 7th May (Tue) around 7-7.30pm after my paper at MPSH 1. Please contact me via e0006929@u.nus.edu if you have seen it. Thank you!
63400,"About the whole bf/gf dating scene whereby who pays what and when, here is my solution.

For me and my gf, we have a separate Bank account whereby we both contribute - $200 (me) & $100 (gf) and topping up again if needed. 

It doesn’t have to be $200 & $100, it can be 10/90 -50/50 , 60/40 , 70/30 etc. (Both consensual & comfortable)

Just use that debit card and paywave for everytime yall go out tgt? But of course during valentines day/anni/bdae etc it will be a different story."
