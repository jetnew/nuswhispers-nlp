52798,"People buy the newest iphone because the depreciation is just $70 per month. (Buy a brand new phone at $1900, one year later resale value is about $1100) but yet the satisfaction, utility and including the opportunity to HaoLian may far exceed the $70.

So this is why people queue. Perfectly logical.

On the other hand, if you would want to own a car, minimum monthly  depreciation is $700. (Just the car itself, excluding operating cost) For people with relatively sufficient disposable income but not enough and not willing to spend on a car, buying the newest phone model really make sense.

Even if iPhone goes to 2.5k to 3k, and depreciation goes beyond $100 monthly, the sales will be good. Because the next jump to a car is far too wide.

52762,"As more internship programs are being started, there will be a higher risk that students are exploited to work on the cheap. 

Especially when these internships are abroad, students are more vulnerable because they have to finish the program or risk extending their term because by the time the internship has started, so would the school term. They are also less likely to have any background information on the companies, and would probably not think as much about their compensation as their employers.

It is understandable that the university wants their students to have some real world experience. An internship is perhaps a demonstrable way to show that. Unfortunately in some cases it is the student who has to pay the price for their ignorance, where simple questions are all it takes to prevent it. If you think the people running the show are going to do that for you, good luck. Hopefully people going on internships will question their prospective employers, because it is not money, as much as it is time, that one stands to lose."

how do you even go about this? if i state that i have a boyfriend, i'm indirectly hinting that the guy is making friends with me to get to the next level. if i don't, after some time, i may end up with a pissed-off guy because i ""lead him on"" or ""friendzoned him"" by acting like a friendly person. 

it's not easy to randomly mention your boyfriend during the conversation and in the first place, i shouldn't have to drop hints about my boyfriend. it's so much easier when it's between girls and girls where most of the time, you don't have to worry that the girl has some romantic motive. it sucks. it's almost like if i'm not available romantically, i'm not worth anything else."

I just want to apologise for reaching out to you in an inappropriate way and causing you discomfort because of my action.

In a weak moment very uncharacteristic of mine, I forgot the fact that we both have had our own lives without each other. That I have no idea how the situation is like for you at the moment. That I have no rights to suddenly pop into your life once again and inevitably bring along the memories that I don’t know whether cause you pain, disgust or merely indifference...

And thank you. Thank you for not reaching back to me and preventing us from making a terrible mistake for the second, or third time? For teaching me that life doesn’t always go according to my plan, and how to continue being gracious in those moments. I guess I have more growing up to do. I guess, I might no longer be a girl but I’m not yet a woman either.

And thank you, for giving me back that part of me that seemed to have gone with you. I don’t even think I’m making much sense here but somehow, I feel like myself again. I can feel a sense of control of myself going back to me from my head all the way to my fingertips. And I don’t think it will go away. So once again, I just want to apologise and thank you, and wish you all the best."

52715,"This post is intended to provide a balanced view with  regards to NUSSU Internal Council Election yesterday.

*Disclaimer: I was there as an observer and asked a number of questions to both Presidential Candidates. I am not associated with any clubs, any parties or whatsoever. The views and opinions expressed below shall reflect mine and mine only.

I am a Y4 student who have never once interested in NUSSU's affairs. To be honest, I am just a typical apathetic NUS student who mind my own business throughout my 4 years in NUS. However, something drew my attention during this NUSSU election. It was none other than the manifesto put forward by the concerned students' (CNS) team. I was strongly motivated by their their agenda which captured the ideals and values that I religiously believe in. Hence, I exercised my right to vote for the first time and voted for them. Although I personally  know the 2 candidates  (belonging to the so-called ""Insider Team"") that are representing my constituency since both of them are from my major, I still voted for the CNS
representative. I really had full faith in CNS. 

However, I also came to realise that I have yet to hear much from the other team and understand their side of the story. Besides that, I also wanted to see the candidates physically, especially the Presidential Candidates, and assess how dedicated and committed they are to their campaign promises. I thus decided to attend the meeting yesterday. I honestly did expect a fair bit of commotions and drama,  especially given that it has been such a contentious and controversial election campaign. In fact, I was also interested to know how each candidate would respond to questions on the importance of having an united NUSSU exco regardless of parties (I did raise a qn on this to both candidates) as I am of a view that  now is the time to put aside the differences and work together as one. 

CNS Presidental Candidate was the first to present which followed by a Q and A session.  I found him eloquent, idealisitc, determined and knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I was pretty impressed. I felt that he does deserve to be the President of NUSSU. 

Next was the Presidential Candidate from the so-called ""Insider Team"". He did a pretty simple presentation mainly emphasising on his motivations to run for the post and his past experiences, which then followed by a Q and A session. I found him frank, understanding, sincere and pragmatic. To be honest, he did not impress me as much as CNS Presidential Candidate especially in terms of presentation. However, he did one thing that took my breath away. His frank and humble  admission to the council that he is neither a visionary nor a strong communicator. To me, the fact that he is willing to lower himself and tell everyone that he is an imperfect being like everyone else instead of portraying himself as a perfect leader who is above everyone else is a good indication that he is not an elitist and that he truly believes in the philosophy of servant leadership. Moreover, I was really blown away by his track record in advocating for the welfare of disabled students as he could easily recall their names and explained with concrete examples what he proposed to the NUS management in his capacity as depty welfare sec for them. Only then, I realised how sincere and genuine this guy is unlike how some people have tried to portray him online. It then hit me that I should not have judged him based on a 3rd party's opinions (especially if the defamations made are anonymous).

Although I dont wish to end this post on a negative note, I would like to highlight that I was totally appalled by the conduct of some of the CNS candidates and their allies during the Q and A session for the ""Insider Team"" Presidential Candidate as they were not only harping on his marginal win as a candidate representing his constituency but also getting emotional and raising voices towards the candidate. These kind of disrespectful acts are uncalled for in a civilised setting. Please refrain from such acts during the second session later today. Do remember that getting emtional does not solve any problems and issues. I am extremely disappointed to see such behaviors in people that I have voted in with full faith. 

By the way, please stop playing
politics guys. No one is going to benefit from it in the long run. Do grow up please. 

With best intentions, 
Zay

52714,"""One of the official reasons given for the requirement of outgoing club's MC endorsement is for the outgoing club MC to only endorse students who have contributed to that club. However, curiously, some of the past NUSSU exco candidates for clubs were not active members of the clubs. With such candidates still being endorsed by the outgoing MCs, questions have to be asked on the reasons why the outgoing MCs decide to endorse or not endorse certain candidates.""

Not just in the past, even in the current exco, there is a significant half of the elected exco representatives who have not made any contributions to the club that they represented in the external elections (Engineering Club, CAC, CSC, NUSPA just to name a few). It was more like a strategic way to garner votes university-wide since voting booths were set up in a prominent area in one of the clubs' compounds during the voting period.

We would also find out in due time whether these representatives really represent the voices of each constituent club in the exco, given the lack of experience and past contributions in the club they represented in the external elections. Only time would tell if these students ran the elections for the sole interest of serving the student population."

Months of clearing out all memorabilia of him only to find something else tucked in some corner, and then feeling really terrible for a week or so... And there were days where I just missed the entire relationship and remembering all the good things and all the good times we shared and basically how good a boyfriend he was to me.

But I remember all the shit he did too, and I remember how badly it ended and exactly how his selfishness landed me in that pathetic state of misery. How his unwillingness to reassure and deal with my issues but rather choosing to ignore me when I felt down caused me no end of social anxiety and mistrust in relationships. How he was toxic to everyone I knew, choosing to rather tear me away from my friends than to get to know them. But that's over now, it's all in the past, and with time I'll forget.

I choose to let go. I choose to realise that it does not matter anymore; the past is the past. I can't change anything, and missing those times will just make me long for it more, and so as bittersweet as it is, I'm letting go of the memories as well. I won't let them control me any more. I choose to let them fade and age, one day to be less than a bad dream a long time ago.

They're in the past, and they don't matter.

Slowly, I began to see that who I am is not defined by who I'm dating, but who I choose to be, and what I choose to do.
