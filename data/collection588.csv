58898,"With regards to the confessions on coding, #58833 and #58829, those who have learnt coding before, or are learning coding right now, know how frustrating it is to do coding, and make the program work. Take care, brother. While programming is stress and all, health is of utmost importance, and you should still eat and sleep regularly, and bathe and detox regularly, to maintain a good health. All the best for the coding project that you are doing."
58897,"I haven't been sleeping well. People are noticing, and saying I look really tired. I do feel really tired, and I don't know how much longer this can go on. A small part of me hopes that someone will figure out that something is not quite the same with me this sem. I know that's unlikely - the last conversation I had in school that didn't revolve around work, deadlines, or small talk feels like a really long time ago. We're all busy, and there are always things to do, places to go. I look like some other busy student, but really I'm thinking - when will this end?"
58896,The guys who negatively judge party girls are the incels that no one wants. They seem unhappy that the party girls are having fun and they are not able to be part of the action. Those who have satisfying relationships don't obsess over other people's intimate lives. 
58895,"My gf and I have been together for 6 years. We met through a mutual friend when I was in year 1 while she has just graduated and started working. She has always been a loving and supportive gf but ever since I graduated, she has been trying to discuss marriage with me and saying things like how she is not young anymore. Truth is I don't want to settle down anytime soon. Afterall, I'm still young and I want to focus on my career first. I am thankful for her support all these years but I am really tired of her bringing up marriage from time to time. But it's not easy to break it off with her as my family likes her alot. Now the question is how to end things with her without causing too much pain to her? I really don't wish to hurt her."
58894,"hey #58894, I agree with you? I've been in a long term relationship and recently I found out my bf cheated on me two years ago. I was heartbroken and shocked because he's like the best bf one could ever ask for. He's always been there for me, spending most of his time with me, saving up to buy gifts and making cards for me on special occasions, helping me with my schoolwork and housework when I'm tired, taking care of me when I fell sick... At first I wanted to just break up with him but I realised that despite the cheating, nothing has changed at all. What you said is right. To me, it's as if cheating has never occurred and life goes on as usual. I was sad only after I found out about it. All along he's been treating me so well and my family loves him too. I've been very happy and content with having such a wonderful partner and we were and still are very much in love after 5 years together. Is it necessary to pursue the matter now? Should I just let the matter rest since it didn't affect our relationship at all? Should I continue staying in this relationship?"
58893,"Hi everyone just got my A level results and looking for some advice which got me here, especially for NUS FASS and Yale NUS PPE.

I would be very grateful If any seniors can provide information, especially on Yale NUS PPE thanks!"
58892,"I've been looking around for summer internships, and for at least one of the big 4 firms I applied to there were specific questions regarding if and when you have an ict call up and they insist you declare it upfront. Given it's a structured 10 week internship programme, and I don't want to assume the worst but it does appear that there is an additional opportunity for discrimination in the hiring process. If you're not able to commit to the entire internship for one week because you need to serve, does that mean you are a terrible candidate who gets disqualified even getting to an interview? Even when both advance to an interview, you have two equal candidates, and the employee knows one has ict of two weeks and the other doesn't, it's pretty obvious to the employer to reject the applicant with ict? In such a scenario, is there any realistic way you can seek fairness without blowing up your chances in the industry in future?

For small startups, I can see why they might shy away from potential interns who can't commit for the full period because of ict (because the presence of the intern may be much larger), though it's still not the way to treat those who serve imho, but if large companies are doing likewise it does seem to betray the fair hiring practices and meritocracy which Singapore strives for. Given how our education system is encouraging students to do more internships at an earlier stage, if this discrimination is not fixed those who served are going to be left at a serious disadvantage if they're looking to enter the private sector. In the wake of everything which has happened over the past month, beyond just talking about recognising the efforts of those who serve, are we making any progress to remove the discrimination faced by them?"

58885,"No judgement watchdog is here woof woof. Since people seem to not get the idea of minding their own business let me break it down for you:

Girls/guys that want to party, go ahead and go wild, but you have to know that it might be a criteria that people wouldn’t want as a long term partner and you can’t force someone to accept it. Its like how some people wouldn’t date smokers, you can’t tell them it’s wrong to have that preference. Yes it’s a perfectly acceptable activity, and also yes it’s perfectly acceptable to not want to date people that party regularly. 

People who don’t want to date party goers: don’t like then don’t date la mf talk to much crap for what. Get off your fkin high horse you’re not any better than others just because you hold to an arbitrary idea of purity. 

Basically, do what you want, date who you like. Just don’t be a self righteous, judgemental prick. Is it so hard to understand???"

58865,"I have been recently reading a lot of vile and misogynist posts( supposedly by guys) about ‘party girls’. As a guy I would like to give my 2 cents -

1. For those who are using the concept of so called ‘sexual market value’ need to stop reading all the pick up artist junk that has originated over the years in the USA and uk. If you think that provides any insight into women, I have a bridge to sell you and you need to seriously start questioning your education and whether your money is better spent there or sorting out your issues first with a counsellor.

2. Congratulations on realising that girls can be complete *ucktards too, that they also have desired, feelings, fantasies and a dark side to them. But maybe you should think about why you had such an idealistic, highly conservative and essentially dehumanising view of girls that they have failed to live up to? 

3. Now here’s a really juicy one, girls pay attention. Are you angry and jealous because girls can easily get attention and romantic company and sex and a buffet of guys lined up by just wearing a nice dress and putting on make up or simply because the female form is so eye catching by nature? Are you afraid or frustrated by this sheer power bestowed upon them by nature that  makes you at once feel lustful and inadequate so you put it down as soon as you encounter it?  I know it does and that’s why you don’t like those party girls so much. All of us straight guys have these feelings but we don’t act upon them by denigrating the other gender and calling them by pejoratives. We either brush them off or try to understand them to come to terms with them.  
And anyway I’d bet you a thousand dollars that if you were a ‘party girl’you’d do the same! You’re just jealous that you can’t.

58863,"After a few years in NUS, I'm still somewhat out of place within my cohort. 

Perhaps it's my social skills which shun people away, but what most don't know is that I have an underlying mental condition. 

I've tried so hard to fit in but I don't have the energy to continue anymore. Some people think I'm some ""arrogant"" person focused on academics, but that was never my intention and I gave up trying to change that impression.

I recently left my CCA and isolated myself from most of my cohort. I do volunteer my time for certain causes, but I typically don't share it with most people - perhaps if I did I could be perceived as ""less arrogant and selfish"" but it's an extremely personal thing to me.

The reason why I need to focus on my grades so much is because that's the only thing I have to survive in the working world - by being hardworking. It's extremely demoralising to be rejected for so many internship positions despite having similar CAP and capabilities than others simply because of a mental health condition (it's quite easy to tell from the interviews).

I'm also a TA for some modules in NUS. Not sure if the professors who took me on are aware of my mental health condition (NUS has an official record). My students look up to me like some expert guy who has things going smoothly in life, but I'm very afraid that their whole impression of me will be gone if they found out my ""dark secret"" and I would be fired.

I do have a tiny handful of friends, though most of the time I feel like a burden to them. I heard that most people say that university is the best time to make friends - unfortunately I'm failing terribly at it. 

I've been seeing the school counsellor for my condition but I'm not sure if it's helping. I just really need to get this off my chest somewhere as I'm literally about to have another breakdown again.

I do have a question for professor Ben Leong (or any other professor who is active here): does NUS allow students with mental health conditions to be TAs? I do have a relatively decent track record of teacher ratings >= 4.5 / 5 if it helps.

Posting here may be a bad idea as eventually my identity might be traced. If I do lose my position, well, I'll just take it as a harsh fact of life."
58860,"Shout-out to the ""coffee artist"" who unveiled his masterpiece at AS1-02-03 on Friday. Thanks for keeping me awake throughout my boring lesson with the smell of coffee. /s

Most students don't care whether you eat/drink in class but the moment you dirty the classroom and do nothing about it, you're being plain inconsiderate. At least tell a cleaner to clean it up and apologise for your mistake. It's pathetic for you to have gone through at least 10 years of education and still behave like a barbarian. Shame on you!

58858,"How the hell do you get to meet girls in this Boring uni to date? I have been here for more than a year as an international masters students and haven’t attended a single flat party or made friends with a local. I joined the skating club which had a few girls but it’s almost as if girls just don’t want to socialise. I don’t go to clubs as I find them a waste of money and time. When I was an exchange student in Europe the locals would actively take the initiative to at least say hi if not include us in social activities.whereas here the atmosphere is one that makes you feel like ‘couldn’t give a shit if you aren’t local’. It’s almost as if there is no culture of socialising in this uni. Everyone prefers to be in their own silos, either with their friends or their own lonely selves, quietly admiring their Waifus or Instagram likes. Is this just an issue with graduates cause we don’t have halls, only pgp and utown or with undergraduates too? "

Let me tell you why 28 for a guy is too old.

In general, decent guys start having sex at 19 (party guys may start even earlier). At a general rate of 1 new partner a year, that means a count of 10 unique vaginas by 28.

That’s a double digit body count which is unacceptable to most girls! And we’ve not even accounted for one night stands and non penetrative “it doesn’t count” sex. 

Also, the more times the sex, the lower the quality of the sperm.  

Guys who finish and close factory before 28 usually can maintain quite well. If your man only starts at 28, by the time he’s done you can kiss your sex life good bye.

What you will have left is finding it hard to conceive because your guy has too little or low quality sperm.

That's when you realize that party guys and party girls both shouldn't receive any judgment on their sexual lifestyle, and it really is none of your business. Frankly, you sound really really ludicrous. I wouldn't mind dating a party guy as long as they're checked and clean. What matters is really what they are deep down. (Deep down you don't seem to have much substance actually... So are you trying to brag about being a virgin or something? If you're not a virgin, then you're a hypocrite. Lol. Please don't breed.) "

Justifying fwb and promiscuous acts
Justifying hiding abortion from guy
Justifying letting husband raise other man’s kid

Not only does the anonymous posts justify these act, a lot commenters actually also tolerate these ideas. 

Education has imbued you girls with reasoning, arguing and critical thinking power. But sadly at the expense of moral compass. 

An analogy would be a girl is given a gun. But whether she use the gun to protect her country or murder her neighbor depends on her moral compass and value. 

Similarly, education has imbued you girls with arguing and rationalizing power such that you can spin black into white and white into black if you try hard enough or try hard enough to see from a different perspective. 

Being able to justify fwb, partygirl or literally anything in the world merely shows how intectual, well educated and shrewd you are. But it’s the moral virtues and Chinese 美德 that ultimately determine which side you will take.

And I am expecting that girl are gonna use their intellect to critic my post too, arguing that virtue and value mean different things to different people, blah blah blah... I can only urge you girls to step out of the intellectual and argumentative realm and introspect about your own principles.

Remember, birds with the same feather flock together. If you like to sleep around and being promiscuous, only playboy and fukboi will flock to you because like attract like. I highly doubt you two can live a stable and loving life till old age with this kind of fundamental value.

They couple will only have starting fresh grad salary how to raise a child in Singapore's environment? In addition have to date someone 1 years or so, Which means by 25yo the girl should already be meeting or dating a guy she needs to marry? I think there is a mismatch in financial ability/fertility planning. This doesn't apply for guys but unfair for girls who need to catch this window period. There is a lot of guys who say they will only date girls <28yo. They choose based on age not taking into account personality etc. I think this stereotype should be totally less emphasized.

Really, any guy who is a victim of paternity fraud in today’s age totally deserves it. 

Secret paternity tests are so widely available. You just need to swab the inside of your cheek and that of the child in question, then send the samples back to the lab and you’ll get your results. 

Worried about mistakes? Then use multiple labs to verify. 

You don’t even need to let your wife know. 

If the kid is not yours, I think there’s a clause in the women’s charter that allows for annulment. 

Usually the woman know who the real father is but he’s usually some deadbeat loser that’s not as rich and caring as you.

58820,How to know if a girl likes u thru text?
58819,"Long post ahead. 

It’s been 16 years since we got together, 11 years since we split up for the first time, 10 years since we got back together and 8 years since you left me without telling me why. 

Not knowing why caused me a lot of distress. I created 101 reasons for why you left, mostly excuses for you and doubts about myself. Perhaps I wasn’t good enough, perhaps you found someone else, perhaps I was too boring. Back then, despite not having closure, I told myself that I needed to move on. Life is not just about you and I. There are many other people who care about me.

I am very lucky to have met my significant other (H) who is patient and loving, and somehow managed to put me back together. I was in so much pain that I could not talk about you to anyone, including H. With time, I subconsciously buried you somewhere deep in my mind. 

When we ran into each other again a few months ago at a friend’s wedding, you me and H were seated at the same table. Except for one or two birthday or new year greetings I sent, we hadn’t been in contact for the last 8 years. Yet, by a twist of fate, we ended up sitting at the same wedding table at the wedding of a friend who did not know that we knew each other. Needless to say, it was awkward. I wondered if you can still see the hurt and pain you left almost a decade ago. 

I don’t know why but I felt the need to connect with you again. I wanted to know how you’ve been. I needed to know that you are well taken care of by someone... that you are happy. A part of me still care about you deeply. 

We met up, joked around for a bit. You suddenly asked if I wanted to talk about the past. Why not? I’ve moved on and am in a loving relationship, almost getting married. You said you are sorry. That you could not come to terms with your sexual orientation then and could not talk about it. Even now, you cannot accept who you are.

At that point, I felt: 

- relief: you left not because I wasn’t good enough 

- anger: I could not go about my life for at least three years after you left because I didn’t know why... I believe I must have been depressed 

- sorry for you

After that meeting, old memories flooded my mind. Snippets of our times together, pain from you leaving... I started feeling the pain I felt when you first left. It’s like all those emotions that I’ve locked up somewhere as a defence mechanism of my survival instinct were suddenly unleashed. I texted you about random things in hope that all these would go away. It got worse. I started tearing when the memories came back. I texted you about things that happened between us in the past, hoping that that would help me process it. Unfortunately, that made you uncomfortable, you said you didn’t know where this was going and our conversation terminated again. 

On hindsight, a few random thoughts:

- delayed processing of emotions is extremely unhealthy, do not let this happen to anyone you break up with 

- we didn’t make it because you could not accept yourself for who you are... we were doomed at the beginning 

- in a weird way, what happened between us, made me appreciate H more 

- People are divided about whether lovers can become friends. I think yes, if there isn’t too much hurt and pain. While I wish the best for you, it seems I’ve been conditioned to feel pain when I see/think about you. One day this may go away... I don’t know when

- I don’t know why but I want you to have someone too... so that you are no longer lonely and drifting around "

58807,"Don't think you remember, nor that it mattered.
Every little giggle, every bit of joy.
Encapsulated the peaceful simplicity, the comforting warmth.
The genuinity of converse, the precious connection.
The lack of strings attached, the ease to speak our minds.
Our naïvety and the mistakes we made, I'm surprised everything somehow always turns out fine.
This wasn't what you wanted, and I respect that.
You want practicality, you want security.
All that I understand, who would want a life of ups and downs?

It's been a year since, I thought time has healed.
Yet my heart seeks for that simplicity, that very connection we could otherwise have had.
Perhaps I'm salty, or just paranoid, but I have not seen the joy you had in your eyes since.
Yet who am I to say that, when it took me a year to know you didn't feel the same.
Perhaps it doesn't concern me, but I do pray he treats you well.
You'd probably never see this, but it's all right.
I have no qualms, I have no complains.
Just a simple request for that lucky guy and many other guys out there:
Love her heart like the very heart of your own, protect it the way you would protect your own.
Regardless of how little you've done to ""earn"" her heart, cherish it by attempting to win it every single day.
Trust me, you deserve far less than what she's giving you."
58806,"I'm the OP of #58806. Sad to see that many of you don't get the point of my post. I said that my aunt was in the wrong for the adultery in the first place, and nowhere did I imply that infidelity is acceptable (except in the wild imaginations of some commentators). Okay maybe it was exaggerating to say that my uncle was 'equally' terrible for acting the way he did, but the fact remains that it's a shitty thing to walk out on children you have known and loved for 9 years simply because of their paternity, which they didn't know and have no control over. The whole point of my post is that cheating on your spouse is bad, but since it's done and there's no way to undo it, with horrible consequences for the child if you confess and no consequences for the husband if you don't, the most ethical thing to do is to keep it secret forever.

p.s. I assume the original confessor is either too far along to get an abortion, or religiously opposed to one."
58805,"I'm sorry to say this, but many companies are finding ways to transform themselves and do whatever they can to appear welcoming and wait for it, new. New as in open space concepts. Open space discussions. Coffee talks with senior management. Bonding sessions with superiors. Desk hogging. Whatever. They don't realise the fact that whatever they do, it's not going to work unless the senior management changes its mindset about certain stuff. 

First, many of the senior management people, and I mean many, will ask this question when they see a hoobae, meaning a subordinate or younger employee leave the office early. Eh where you going. So early go home? Look, if that person already finished his or her work, and there are no more tasks to be handed to them, why can't they leave? Sit in the office and warm the chair is it?

Second, lunches. Omg let's have a department lunch. Let's have a group lunch. Whatever. I just want to watch my Korean drama or listen to my music in peace and eat. Just leave me out on your lunch. Lunch is me time. I don't want to have to face my superior again when I'm having lunch. 

Thirdly, if you really want to change, see if you can achieve this. Your office allows ppl to communicate from one end to another by shouting. Or allows subordinates to listen to soft music or radio and white noise. And let's not see anyone bringing in lunch to sit at their tables and do their work. If you can achieve that, it means that your employees are comfortable being themselves in the office and naturally, they will perform better. 

All the beautiful exterior and co working spaces with pantry access and what not. They are all facades. Some don't even have free pantry please. "
58802,"Never have i thought i will fall for you after growing closer. I would have the patience to wait for you, but given my current life situation, it will be better for the both of us to drift apart. I miss you dearly...

58801,"Hi guys, need some help here. 

Im currently an SMU econs undergrad. Just completed NS. I am thinking of switching to NUS FASS econs. Now, I know that locally, SMU econs is more favourable. But I MAY choose to work overseas and NUS is definitely much more well recognised internationally as NUS is definitely far more prestigious than SMU in that sense. 

So any advice would be nice. Thanks."
