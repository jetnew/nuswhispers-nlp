53495,"Evergreen guy here. I have been interested in this girl since the past year. So imagine my glee when I finally got to know her (by chance) some months ago. Now, we happen to attend the same class. I am however, a complete tool. I sort of freeze up whenever I see her, although I do want to know her better. Think of me as Raj from Big Bang Theory. To make things harder, she is always surrounded by friends. How?"

53492,"Yesterday I was in the CLB male toilet between level 5 and 6. I had quite a bad stomachache so while peeing i could not help it but accidentally let out quite a loud fart. Even though i was in a cubicle, i felt really embarassed but less than 5s later, the person in the cubicle beside me suddenly farted even louder as if trying to challenge me to a fart battle. I did not reciprocate cos I know my farts will not sound very pleasant (if you know what i mean). But to this bro, idk what your intentions were, but honestly, I really want to get to know you and be your friend. Cos that shit was whack! (literally)"
53491,"What do software developers do when they get old? I think companies prefer young ppl who have more energy to catch up with technology. My friends who has worked as developer for a few years say that they strive to become manager. However, not anyone can become manager or tech lead, as the number of managers is always less than the number of developers. I really wonder what will happen to developers when they get old and cannot get to the manager position. Will they be unemployed?"

53486,"Been in my first relationship for about a year and now I'm ready to call it quits and return to my single life. 90% of the time my GF would be bitching about her colleagues and friends and all the mundane stuff in life. I mean, hello, who really gives a damn about your boss scolding your colleague or your colleagues child misbehaving or the latest cosmetic trends? Idk if girls like to dump these stuff on their partners. We also have no common interests as she is into shopping and all the girl stuff and I'm into sports and gaming. I just feel that this relationship is a total time waster and have given zero value add to my life, the only nice thing that I can claim I am 'attached'. I could have used all those time to learn some new skills or starts some side projects."
53485,"Hi, I found a laptop at the bus stop opposite kr mrt this evening (9 Oct) at about 11pm, if it's yours pls comment below and I'll pm you! "
53483,"To #53483 what happened to you is disgusting. and i think it takes certain amount of bravery to come forward especially when you know there are certain consequences you may face due to your action. so thank you, for being brave, which already makes you bigger than many of us, including me.

i guess you rubbed many people the wrong way when you called something by what it is - sexual assault/harassment. which is why people tried to sweep it under the rug, with no follow up, trying to make it out like a fake post, claiming that allegations are only allegations until proven guilty. Mind you, allegation is all it takes for one to be investigated somewhere else. But there are also people who genuinely want to help...

I don't think you are being overly-dramatic at all. You never know how something can affect you until you go through it yourself. From your post I guess that you won't try to seek proper justice and put yourself out there for judgement and gossips, but if one day you eventually do decide to take action, just know that there are support for you :)

And please confine in people who matter to you - your parents, your siblings, your close friends... If not, professional help. You don't have to go through it alone.   "
53482,"I've had instances where some girls look back and giggle at me thinking I'm cute. Some girl eyed me all the way when we walked past each other today. But up until now I've never had a relationship before. Why? Because I don't even have friends either.

Maybe people also avoid me because I dont tend to smile. Not that I can help it since I've always felt sad most of my life.
Well, what an ironic life I live.

53471,"To #53396, speaking on a recieving end, (a girl here) I once confessed to my ex boyfriend that I might be on the spectrum and he reacted harshly saying he is the only child and he cannot accept if I might pass on my genes to have mentally disabled (autistic) children. He then ask me rhetorical question do I know how hard it is to raise autistic children. After some cooldown even though he still wanted to have a relationship with me he started treated me with disrespect and eventually cheated on me like nothing is wrong. He assumed that autistic people couldn't have any emotions, which isn't true. Not to say you couldn't break up with him on such matters, as relationship decisions are personal, but remember to treat him like how you would want to be treated if you were him."

53465,Hi people ive been in a deep state of stress these past few months. Since CNY this year my whole family mocked me for not bringing a GF to bainian. I am a 22 year old male and have not been attached my whole life. Ever since that day ive been worried sick i would never be able to get a gf and get married. What should i do assuming that im just an average looking male? Is it true only a tall good looking guy can ever get girls?
53464,"I don't think I can stand my personal environment any longer. Right now, I can't stop crying over getting 85% for a small test. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I'm under immense amounts of stress and anxiety over my employability. It doesn't help that I'm in arts and everyone says arts students don't get hired. 

I'm overloading MCs, juggling three clubs, and doing part-time work, and it is nearly unmanageable. I never have a day where I don't have late/delayed tasks, and my social life is nonexistent outside of the clubs. And I still feel extremely worried about being employable. 

I think it is also getting to me that many employers only seem to want Year 3s for their internships, and I'm only Year 1. But I am told that I need internship experience now right now, because employers prefer interns with prior internship experience. It's a Catch-22, and I get very bitter at peers who escape this paradox by using family connections. My close friend has a lawyer as her dad, so she got a law internship she isn't at all qualified for-- and she didn't even help me, so I still can't stop resenting her. 

My parents still caution me about two relatives who are roundly shamed by everyone in the family for being ""useless"", because one of them changed majors halfway through uni life, and the other was unemployed for a year. It is driving me to consider suicide if I don't get a ""decent"" job within a year of graduating. 

I feel like something must change, or something drastic might happen to myself in the next few years."
53460,"When i love, I tend to love too hard. It's starting to get to me... Im afraid that i'll drop too deep into something I can never get myself out of. So I'm scared to love again. It sucks. The scars are deep... "
53453,"i like this guy who is slightly shorter than me, maybe around 5cm shorter. not that he likes me back for sure but i am just curious as i have always been hearing negative comments about dating shorter guys it makes me wonder what does it really feel like to date guys who are shorter than them. does the opinion of others really not affect them at all? His penis is 5cm shorter than mine. Does it really matter?!"
53452,"Recently I encountered mistreatment in NUS, I'm not too sure who I can go to and I am too scared to confront that person upfront especially with so many people behind me watching. 

I received 1 less fishball from the fishball noodle in Techno. Can anyone help me?"
53451,"In the past, I found it quite strange that other guys could get attractive girlfriends, while I was still single despite me being equally worthy as those guy or even more worthy.

Now, I have figured out why. As expected, I am as worthy as those guy, so I am now attached to a girl who is as attractive the girlfriends of those guys I used to be jealous of.

If you really think that you are a good guy and don't understand why you are still single, you will get a girlfriend eventually, but not now."

53449,"If she thinks that I will beg her to re add me on Facebook after she deleted me, she is wrong.

53447,"It is true that we experience the most freedom we ever had in our lives in uni, compared to being in the rigid system all throughout pri/sch/JC school life and in NS (for guys). However, I tend to feel uneasy when I don't feel like I'm doing something productive, and still not able to cope well with this newfound freedom. 

It sounds silly, but I do miss the days when I'm constantly kept busy with school and CCA-related activities, piles of homework and projects. Now, there seem to be so many small pockets of free time (between lessons, after major exams etc) but I don't know if there's anything meaningful that I can slot in to keep myself occupied, so I can learn a skill or something in the meantime.

53438,"To #53396: While most of the commenters are painting rosy pictures about people with mental conditions or guilt-tripping you, I've actually been there and done that. As all mental conditions are not the same (and many have multiple conditions apart from just autism), I would really urge you to evaluate the seriousness of it before committing. 

At first, he was a sweet guy (with Asperger's), just socially awkward. As we dated, I started realising he has moods. Sometimes he would be 'normal', but other times he would be frustrated and lash out at people. It's like unpredictable PMS. Then when he realised that he could get away with it by blaming it on his mental conditions, our relationship took a turn for the worse.

The mental condition might be real, but it is no excuse for some of the things he had done. Violence and abuse is wrong, regardless if I'm on my period or someone has autism. Sometimes  you might be tempted to give him a chance because of his condition, or that it is 'not really' him, but I accepted that this IS part of him. We may never be able to tell apart what is his 'true character' and what is his condition, but either way it's simple.

Love  yourself first, if it works for you go for it. If it doesn't, then don't. Don't be biased either way.

In the end I broke it off, as I could not live with him anymore. Note, I did not say I could not live with his condition. Since it is a permanent condition, they are effectively one and the same. "

53429,"Women gets slut-shamed for having high sex drive? Maybe. But men will get slutshamed for having any sex drive at all.
My view is that sex is quite an important part of rs and if you disagree that's totally fine. However I got attached to this girl who says that she's OK with sex but for some reason constantly reject my advances. So through mutual friends I learnt that she is actually very conservative and religious and according to them she was adamant about no sex before marriage. OK, at this point, she sort of duped me into the rs but it's fine. I got her out, told her that I respect her views but it's not gonna work between us, give her the whole ""it's not you it's me"" talk, which is quite true and reflective of the situation, and we broke off. She was reluctant but I insisted. Next thing I know, some of her friends did this childish smear campaign against me and tells people in my social circle that I'm a sex maniac and likes to approach girls just for sex, that I'm not worth it, a lot of ugly names. While there wasn't any accusations (thank god) my rep among my friends has been so smeared that even my boss at internship knows about this and apparently asked my female colleagues to be wary of me. So here I wanna ask, if a guy wants sex in a rs does that automatically make him of less value, regardless of other achievements or personality? Isn't this slut shaming? "
