56688,"#56688 - If this is the kind of lame and naive bs that passes for thinking nowadays, getting a job or right course should be the least of your concerns. You neither know him personally nor ever interacted with him yet you feel that you should be defending him. Anyone can provide an opinion but to provide one that is even half believable it should be supported by facts and good argumentation especially if its about someone's future such as career advice. As a phd whose course and advice is so sort after, its doubly important that he provides a well thought out and supported opinion. As a phd I expect him to know the value of such opinion. So far from what I have read he hasnt done that. And EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, as a UNIVERSITY student you should never have an unquestioning attitude towards your professors. University is about critical thinking and increasing the standards of general thinking, not blindly admiring professors who may end up feeding you shit knowledge. And please dont be an idiot and say that one should google for citations and research. That just means you are ok with people giving you terrible opinions and its anyway futile because one should do one's own research, so why do you even bother defending him? "
56686,"Hi seniors, dk if this is a stupid question. I was thinking of choosing computer security as my focus area but am intending to take cs2107 in y2s1 and overload on either a GE or IS1103/ES2660 this sem. May I know if taking GET1004 to get a glimpse of cybersecurity is a dumb move/ not encouraged? 

P.S. I was thinking if I don't like/can't appreciate what I learnt in the GE I will switch my focus area entirely. 

Any advice is appreciated thanks!"

56681,"My birthday is approaching soon. When my friends asked me what kind of gifts i want, I just say the usual stuffs like a simple T-shirt will do. But deep down I yearn for a hug. Even if I have the guts to say it, i don't know anyone whom i can say it to, not even my family."
56679,"Let's admit it! Social Media is a deadly tool to kill us.

Hi #56679, first and foremost, i am in no acquaintance to Ben Leong. Neither do i know him personally  nor ever interact with him once. The only impression he left in me is when i am eating my chicken chop in biz/soc canteen and I saw him talking to himself in his deep thoughts walking towards one of the stalls there. So my opinions below will be a fair and neutral ... 

As far as I know, one of the main reason why fewer profs or even working adults prefer to engage or to express their opinions through social media is because social media is one of a way to lose your job. Not only does it happen here, it happens anywhere around the globe. Many professionals lost their job through ridiculously and shameless posting in the pasts. (Don't come and ask me for citation., You don't know how to google yourselves ah ? ). If a person willing to engage a discussion openly in social media, it is quite stressful too because you have to be very careful in your words and fear that people will quote your words to insinuate for another thing. Thus, that could be one of the reason why lesser profs are willing to comments in NUSWhispers. Thus, do empathize if Ben Leong is willing to post and share his views. Not many profs willing to do that. 

As far as I concern, Ben Leong is just voicing out his opinions and in NUSWhispers, there are no right or wrong answers. Hey come on, this is NUSWhispers where all sorts of truths and trolls appear. This is not a true forum where academics matters come into place. People posts all sorts of questions and comments such as orgy relationships, bleach armpits, complaints etc... Everybody have the freedom to posts and comments as such. If you do not agree to one-saying, it is totally fine to do that. Nobody is forcing you to trust anyone in NUSWhispers. I do not trust Ben either because I do not even know him at all but i think it is good to always open your minds and listen to others. Whether to follow or not to, depends on one's decision after consideration. Similar analogy, you go downstair coffeeshop buy meepok dry. The uncle recommend say meepok wet is better because all guys like wet stuff. First thoughts in mind, you will also not trust the uncle because you do not know him at all but you will listen and consider it with your own thoughts to come up with a conclusion whether you like it to be wet or not right? 

Secondly, it is really naive and immature to expect others to keep feeding you with citation and research. Do your own homework and make your own decision yourselves. So if you intend to challenge the uncle for meepok wet, you expect the uncle to give you citation and research of how good his meepok wet is ? And technology is a very diversify knowledge that has no boundary. Valve, SAP or Linux is good but it does not signifies everything about technology. For example, again on our meepok analogy. You think that putting chilli to meepok is the best but instead, there are also chopped spring onions, deep-fried shallots or tomato to make it a perfect meepok dish in the F&B industry.

Lastly, you got to respect and give it to someone who have good credential It is not easy to finish a PHD. It really takes alot of wetness such as sweat and blood to finish a PHD. You can disagree to his comments but you should have a basic courtesy, humbleness and respect to someone who flair better than you. Even when i am typing this one, I might not even be able to obtain a position from MIT. Many success comes with lots of hard work and wetness behind the scene. You think everything drop from the sky one ah?

Like i said, nobody ask you to trust every post online or to trust anybody. Of course you are free to post whatever you like in NUSWhispers but I do challenge you that if you wish to post, comments it below so we are able to know who you are and will ""try to listen to your advice on your future posts"" because we are all from humble origins. 

Okie... I am going to buy my meepok wet. KthxBye!"

56661,"I intended to take 6 modules (6 x 4MCs) of modules in sem 2. However, I recently found out CORS have allocated me an extra GEQ(up and above the GER mod that I have predicted to be preallocated to and indeed it turns out I got both GER and GEQ in the same semester). I have tried appealing for the UG office but the appeal failed. Now I’m in a dilemma to take 7 modules(6+extra GEQ) or remove 1 module from my list(5+extra GEQ). My intention for taking 6 modules is to make use of some SUs yet not going too overboard with it(I didn’t use a single one in sem 1). I read reviews from NUSMods that GEQ is a trivially easy module, and it’s CS/CU so just taking it in place of another module “isn’t optimal for SU”. Does anyone have any advice on whether I should go with the 6 module plan(cut short 1 module) or the 7 module plan(just take it as planned assuming I can bid for those modules)"

I did not watch my words and hurt many people  unintentionally (I honestly think I was a dick for certain things I said).

There are a lot of people I don't see anymore. im ashamed of my own past. never had the courage or chance to say I'm sorry. (but yeah, sorry does not cure anything that hurt)

Now I look back at my youth, I wish I could wipe away that part of my life and rectify. wished I had been more mature and behaved more like a proper human.

To all whom Ive hurt in my life and never apologised to: I'm sorry. It took me probably a year or 2 before I realised, how terrible person was I, how I thought, how I behaved, what I said. I hope you are well.

56641,"Having an existential crisis is like not knowing what to eat for dinner. You ask other people what they like to eat, but then their answer is always not good enough for you. You want to find the ""one true meal"" that is going to be universally enjoyed by everyone and end up starving for the night because you are too busy nitpicking every single option without trying any of them, while other people got to enjoy their dinner, imperfect or otherwise. 

The fact is, people don't sit in bed all day philosophizing and then suddenly decides that ""XXX is my favorite food"". They also don't go around asking people ""eh whats your favorite food"" and say ""Well your argument on why KFC is your favorite food is the most logically sound. KFC is therefore my favorite food"". That's not how it works. You'll have to try before you choose, and you're not gonna have the luxury to try everything. But if you continue to spend more time questioning the meaning of life instead of going out there to experience life's many offerings for yourself, be prepared to do a lot more mental gymnastics as you watch others enjoy their meaningful lives while you justify to yourself why their ""meaning"" is ""unsatisfactory""."

It changes you. You do things you are normally afraid to do. You get out of your comfort zone because you get comfort from simply being around

Everytime you communicate with them, no matter the distance, it feels like that special someone is right there smiling at you, and you two are in your little bubble, oblivious to the dangerous cold world.

You thought there was a possibility. That perhaps despite an infinitesimal chance of it happening, you might actually be with someone way out of your league.

You start to make plans. You hatch up a plan to confess. You even bought gifts, had locations all planned out. 

You left out one small little detail. 

Fortune favors the bold

Murphy became your best friend.

Whatever that can go wrong will go wrong.

Firstly, many people have said that you will end up teaching with a Math Degree, but in reality, I got rejected for applying as a teacher. (Despite constantly improving on my interview skills).

Secondly, there is an increasing demand for people with Computer Science knowledge. As a Mathematician, I get stuck in the middle of nowhere with just basic CS or Python knowledge. 

Thirdly, Mathematics is a difficult subject, take it only if you have the passion or intend to do further studies, preferably alongside with a Minor. (You must be the type who has a CAP close to 5.0 or no-go)

Now I am stuck with a 1 year gap of no work experience, because I had the confidence that I would be able to enter graduate studies (Masters, PhD), yet my applications did not make it through for a few times.

I feel like school is all about memorising and most of the time, I find myself not knowing what I'm actually doing ( I don't really understand the things taught in school). But somehow, my schoolmates manage to still do ok in school?? I often doubted whether I'm even cut out for med school..... I study really hard, but it seems like I can never cover everything... and when I enter the exam hall it just feels like I didn't study at all.... I mean I still manage to pass my exams (miraculously) but not without constant worry about failing... meanwhile, most of my friends are worrying about not getting distinctions...

I know that I'm blessed to be able to get into this prestigious course and obviously my dream course, but I have no one to consult due to my family and school background and everyone's just so proud that I made it (which adds additional emotional burdens to do well in school) I really just want to pass and graduate normally though... how can I make it easier....?

Sorry for the long post, I finally managed to get all these worries off my chest since I wasn't able to talk to anyone about this... Happy New Year everyone!!! 

(P.S. I tried talking to my friends from other courses about it but they were all like... ""but that's cos you're in med school!"" and I guess they all have their own school problems to deal with too.... so I don't really want to burden them either. I want to try talking to my schoolmates about it too but... everyone's saying it's alright when I don't actually feel like it is) "
56608,"Hi I need some advice on University education in general. Lately, I have been reading and watching videos on entrepreneurs/ successful people like Jack Ma and they all share ideas on how university education isn't the best. I also came to understand that all we are really after is that piece of paper, to help us to get a good starting pay; that's all. How you do in life afterward depends more on your EQ and other qualities like positive attitude etc. Besides, most of the stuff that we learn in Uni isn't going to be used in the future anyway, unless you are into research or being academia. But for most of us looking for a normal job, there is on-job training, and this on-job training does not require intense knowledge. BTW I'm an engineering student. Perhaps all that I have learnt in my four years can help me ""appreciate"" the on-job training, but i don't think I need that ""appreciation"" to survive. I just need to know 'HOW' to do it; knowing ""WHY"" it works is just for self-fulfillment that not everyone will need. As such, I feel frustrated by the Singapore (and actually global) system of the emphasis on grades. I feel frustrated how we learn stuff that are outdated simply because it is difficult to restructure a whole univeristy degree course. It may be less of a problem for engineering students, but for business Profs, how many of them have actually climbed the corporate ladder, learnt the real-world skills and are able to provide quality, pragmatic advice to business students or future entrepreneurs? Some business students I know are seeking external mentors out of the university to cover up this gap and to learn more, but if that is so, what is the point of a university? To get a degree to flow with the system? I guess. 

Can someone advise me on how to go about this? I can't focus 100% of my effort into learning my modules knowing that I will probably forget them and not use them 10 years later in my career."
