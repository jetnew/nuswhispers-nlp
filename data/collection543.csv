Hey there! Here are a few other options that you may consider besides the ones that have been suggested in the previous post: 

1. Mid-term scholarships
2. CPF loan 
3. Approaching the financial aid office at utown to see if they're able to assist you further

4. Taking up a few highly paid part-time jobs like tuition. If you have 5-6 tuition kids at around $50/week each, that will be approximately $1k a month. By hustling more during the holidays, you should be able to foot the school fees on time and have some leftover to spend on food and entertainment

5. Taking LOA for 1-2 semesters and working full time during this period to save up. Do note that there'll be a penalty on school fees should you exceed the normal candidature though, hence overloading will be required for this option 

I personally know of someone who is paying for their own school + hostel fees, and living expenses in this manner by method 4 so it's possible and you wouldn't be alone on this arduous journey. It will be good if you currently have some buffer in your bank account, otherwise I'd personally recommend a combi of 4 & 5, after utilising option 3. Good luck and all the best. Don't give up just yet as you'll emerge stronger after this experience!"

1) I get to eat at McDonald's everyday while my JC kiddo friends can only eat fried food during ""fried-food Fridays"".
2) I have lots of opportunity to pon lecture and tutorial, allowing me to be independent and self-study instead of JC students having a fixed timetable and behaving like zombies
3) We get to save time as we dont have first parade every morning. No Majulah Singapura, no school song
4) Most importantly, poly students are better suited to enter NUS as we trained in not wearing uniform, unlike JC kiddos who cannot tamper pants, cannot dye hair, cannot wear ankle socks!

54367,"Heyyy plastic straw lovers!
 
- The top waste disposed in Singapore 2017 was Plastics (NEA, 2017) at 763,400 out of 2,980,000 tonnes, or 25.6% (1 d.p.).
- Singapore's (only) landfill - Pulau Semakau - has an expiry date of 2035, which has already been brought forward by 10 years from the original 2045. 2035 is 17 years away.
- Singapore's National Recycling Program recycled 2% of total household waste in 2017.
- Singapore ranks 26 out of 142 countries in emissions per capita.
 
We have done great so far! What?
 
Many of you have correctly pointed out that Singapore and plastic straws (by sheer size), is barely responsible for marine pollution; that marine pollution is a result of irresponsible behaviour i.e. littering.  
 
The statistics I shared above are nothing about marine pollution and littering per se. It's about Singapore's/ our individual waste-line. As future tax payers, our wallet$ are also on the line to pay for waste management, reinforce infrastructure to mitigate rising sea levels etc. You and I, are in the picture.
 
The new policy on straws is not meant to be indiscriminate. Simply, instead of a 'opt out' model, it's now 'opt in'. If you need a straw or anything for medical/ personal reasons, please go for it - you are respected and paper straws are available on request.
 
The administration has (unknowingly) created a golden opportunity for the vibrant sharing and exchanging of perspectives - more people than ever are researching enthusiastically, sharing their findings publicly and engaging respectfully about the topic of waste and pollution in Singapore and globally on campus. Better than any compulsory module has done for collective intellectual discourse...I exaggerate. Thanks for shaking up the status quo and allowing ALL of us to be part of the active learning process to slim our waste-line. Plastic straws, as pervasive and dear to our hearts, is only the tip of the wa$teberg.
 
Earth Overshoot Day was 1/August/2018. Since 2/August/2018, we have been living on Earth's 2019 budget for plastic straws. If you ask me, what is sustainability? It's the ability to sustain life on Earth with what Earth has. (Has anyone researched on this too..??? My turn to class part) If through this policy we can push next year's Earth Overshoot Day by a second, that counts tremendously.

Anyway hope to catch y'all at:

"
54354,"#54309: My reaction to #54205 and its comments are quite different though. Many seem quite insistent that girls should be allowed to wear what they want, which must be right of course - it's their bodies; some (if not many) guys like to look; the girls know it; they're happy to flaunt; I don't see the problem.

My question is why guys do not have such freedom in dressing, and will those (especially the women) who are adamantly saying ""let her wear what she wants"", similarly defend a guy walking around in briefs?

Our society now seems to be such that girls can walk around in shorts that, as the OP put it, are little more than underwear - which is great from a straight guy's point of view, of course XD but can you imagine what would happen if a guy tried to do the same? Methinks he'd be lucky not to spend the night in a lockup. If we are happy to assume that a girl dresses like that ""for herself and not for anyone else"", why can't a guy walk around similarly skimpily clothed just because he feels like it? How many of you defending the girl's freedom would similarly tell those who are ""offended"" by a guy walking around in briefs to ""just look elsewhere""?

On a broader point, women in this society have so much freedom to dress as lightly or as provocatively as they want, which I repeat is great. But men are stuck with the same boring and warm clothing regardless of the weather and the wearer's mood. A woman who dresses like a man for business purposes is called confident but a man who dons women's clothing is ridiculed and told to ""man up"". What does this tell you about how we subconsciously view the relative status of the two genders, even if we froth at the mouth with politically-correct statements?

As a guy who used to live alone, I have worn dresses and robes and they are seriously more breezy and comfy than the boring old trousers that every boy grows up with no alternative to. This doesn't make me want to be a woman - I'm perfectly happy with my assigned gender but I just feel if you want to talk about women's freedom to ""wear whatever they want"" and not be a hypocrite, then make sure you genuinely defend men's freedom to walk around in what they want as well. Even if it's a translucent dress with briefs underneath."
54353,"I got a confession to make. I graduated a few years back - first class hons and a healthy handful of awards to go with it. Everyone thinks I have it easy.

I worry about whether I can manage a job with my condition. I worry about my family. I worry about a whole lot of other stuff. It feels so crushing as always. It is even more painful because I need to pretend that everything is fine - who will want to hire such a nervous wreck like me? Sometimes I just want to just disappear from the world, because it's just so painful.

Sigh. Life is hard."

To make a true impact, plastic bags and takeaway boxes should be banned, and the use of private vehicles disincentivised.""

If you dedicate three long paragraphs to talking about the lack of straws is a massive inconvenience, how am I supposed to believe that you would support wider green initiatives that inconvenience you even more? I'm sorry, but I don't buy it. 

Btw you don't need corporations to compel you to go green for bags and boxes and transport. But if you are the kind of person who throws a huge tantrum over how horrible the lack of plastic straws is, I highly doubt you are going green in other areas in your life.

However, I personally favor initiatives that compel people to be eco-friendly, not ""we can do it ourselves, we shouldn't have the government or companies forcing us"". Why? Because it is blatantly obvious that most people have a mindset of ""if you want to go green, that's your business, it's none of my business, and I will resist every attempt to make me personally go green"", so a laissez-faire approach would never work. Without policy, the vast majority would never go green in any way."

54303,"
Sometimes I have these relapses where I just get really lonely but I feel I have no one to turn to. I have friends but at most they're quite superficial, like not really that close or anything. Sometimes I think it's just insta screwing me and making me feel bad about my state of mind and such.

I kind of always wanted a gf but I'm just too scared to take the leap. I'm scared to ask people out for like meals or to hang out because of fear that they're too busy or that I'm desperate. (esp for girls) Like it's also really subconscious for me, but I tend to avoid eye contact and interact with pretty girls because I don't feel I deserve to know them or be their friend. Like for me, I just really want to spend time knowing people and just hanging out (and I have the time to) but I'm just too scared to initiate.

It sometimes really confuses me how my mind works. But I just feel that SG is just this really conservative place and everyone is more worried about grades and careers rather than meaningful relationships. And I've just kind of put myself into that position (or dug a hole) where I basically am really desperate to get to know people, to become closer and to have the kind of social life ordinary uni people have. But that in doing so, I'll just start turning people off and breaking the relationships that I want to create.

What should I do?"

54301,"Hi all, i'm at an important crossroad and i really need some advice right now. A few months ago, i've started a personal trading portfolio for supplement income to pay my tuition/expenses. Ofc this wasn't entirely a smooth ride, but my rate of returns has stabilized over time. Overall, swing trading has proven to be much more profitable than i expected. I've kept a record of all my trade alerts, transactions and analysis, including some videos that details my thought process on the charts. Recently, I'm started to pool capital from relatives(ofc i do pay them a risk premium) since i now feel more confident with handling larger position sizes.

I understand that trading is highly speculative and has little to do with any one particular academic disciplines. I'm really interested in this field, but I've got no economic background apart from *lol* H2 econs. My major has little to do with macro-economics. Recently, I've started creating an algo-based trade-alert generator/logger based on whatever little i've learnt in my foundation mods, and i'm eager to receive insights from certified experts so that i can eventually develop it into a functional app. Does anyone know of courses or modules in nus that delves into trading or managing hedge funds? And for those who are working in the industry, apart from my personal portfolio, what sort of formal qualifications or experience do i need to secure an internship. Thanks"
