65798,"OP of #65771 here, the fact that she's from my jc kinda complicates things since I guess we're pretty good friends, just that we've not talked much recently.

Don't really want this to sour our relationship, and I don't know what will happen if I talk to him alone, yet I guess I don't want her finding out about what happened between me and her current bf. He's honestly quite recognisable, I guess your average well proportioned Chinese guy, I don't know why I didn't recognise him earlier."
65797,"I've been using dating apps but barely get any matches. I am above average looking. I swipe right sparingly, only when I feel that I really like the girl, because if I don't when we match I will find it difficult to start messaging her. I've used cmb for quite a few months, but have only gotten 3 matches despite using almost daily (which didn't lead to anything). Is this normal? what are your experiences?"

Hi this is my first time writing this so I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly but here it goes.

I used to feel depressed about life all the time due to my life and family circumstances and trust me I know what you mean because at times I would have random crying and emotional outbursts too. 

Just few years ago I lost vision to both of my eyesight and I was blind for nearly two years. My vision only just stablized with one permanently damaged eye and a okok eye after four eye surgeries. 

I guess it's a second chance in life thing that makes me appreciate life and the love people have for shown me during this period.

What I wanted to say to you is that don't look at what you got but look at what others don't. A blind person would love to see, a deaf person would love to listen, a handicapped person would love to walk,run and jump as high and fast as he could.

I wake up each and everyday telling myself I love life and I love the people around me.

Learn to love life,yourself more more and appreciate the people around us more because nobody truly lives forever including ourselves.

I wish you best of luck in life, and I hope this helps :)"
65793,"Some actual over-the-phone signs I've gotten from girls.

In no particular order:

They change profile pictures over and over to cuter or sexier outfits and stop changing when you talk to them.

They text you out of the blue about songs, books, movies, anything they like or think you'll like and throwback to previous conversations.

They start taking measured intervals to respond to your texts, usually within the five-ten minute range.

They send prettier selfies or find excuses to send them.

They text first if you haven't spoken to them in a while.

They stop asking to hang out but are almost always available when you ask them.

If you text when they're busy they tell you exactly when they'll be free or text immediately when they've finished.

You usually start to notice these after you've hung out one-on-one. 

Hope this helps. 

Go bang, okay?"

65791,"Guys I just graduated from uni and a local bank hired me through a recruitment agency. But it’s a contract role for one year with my payroll under the said agency (will Be converted should you choose to stay and of course meeting the KPI). Is it wise to go for the job?

65790,"I have been in a LDR with my bf for 2 years. He recently got back and I was so excited to spend time with him. But seems like the time we spent together are either with family or friends, doing what he wants. We dont go out on dates anymore. And he started to feel that he needs more social life.... and everytime he is with his friends, he will never pick up my call or even text me. But when I’m with him, he is always on his phone replying texts and playing games. We have been together for more than 5 years. Do you think he still loves me? What should I do?"
65788,"Hi everyone. Looking for genuine advice. I've recently had a job offer and accepted it via email. But several days before the actual signing of offer letter, I've found out from the HR (made some side queries) with regards to the leave benefits that kinda felt contradicting as the offer letter did not state those concerns which I've addressed. Things like earned leave policy and only recognising MCs from their own company doctor (the offer letter states that staff can visit non panel doctor but the HR said they don't accept it unless its an emergency - I'm wondering what constituents an emergency to them??). So was feeling confused and is wondering if I should just swallow in and sign the job offer or politely reject them as I'm not sure if they have more contradicting policies.. Is it possible to rescind a job offer before the actual signing? Thank you all, in advance, for taking the time to read and reply."
65776,I am a local engineering graduate. I've been seeing this European girl I met a year ago and she's now in Singapore pursuing a graduate diploma.

65774,"I've been reading many posts about relationship here in NUSWhispers and noticed something. Many people share their love problems with other whisperers, asking for help, and more often than not, people would advice them to break up. Just wanna let these og posters know that it's your relationship, your call. You had shared your problems w the public, so it's natural for them to advice you to break up. However, remember the good times you had too. Remember that no relationships are perfect, and that the longest lasting relationship is one whereby you stand through thick and thin w your partner. Cheers."

65769,"What is wrong with me? I'm 26 and I've never fallen in love before. Growing up I had a couple of crushes in school but these were fleeting and just based solely on appearance. These feelings all faded after a couple of months. I do find people attractive/charming, but I've never had any form of affection for them. It's like admiring a work of art. You leave the museum thinking it's been a pretty good day and after a good night's sleep you go back to work. Nothing's changed. You don't think about the Mona Lisa anymore. 

What is it like to fall in love? Is there something wrong with me? I've never dated anyone. I'm just alone all the time. I'm at the age where everyone's just attached or married and I'm just all by myself. 

PS. I'm a girl BTW and find people of any gender attractive."

65764,"Would appreciate if anyone could provide some advice for me.

I'm interested in a girl (and think she's really cute), but I can't tell for certain if she's interested in me too. She seems sort of interested. I eventually asked her out and she said yes

It's our first time out. Not sure if she's going out just as ""a friend"" or if she has feelings for me too. Would it be awkward if I pay for her meal in this case?

Should I just treat her as a friend throughout the date?  I don't wanna come off like I'm rushing into this since it's our first time meeting but I don't want to be friendzoned either. 

She's someone I can see myself being together with and I want to make this work out. But I've no experience at all in dating or going out. Could any kind soul please offer advice?"
65763,I know its already 10 of July but are any other freshman still in the common pool for RC application? My friends either got their offer or rejected from every RC but mine has been in the common pool for a while already...
65760,"I really don't understand why B.Comp Dissertation (FYP) is a requirement for first class honours (FCH) in CS. FYP replaces the ""Industrial Experience Requirement"", which can also be fulfilled with alternatives such as internships and NOC. As long as I choose literally any other route (than doing FYP), it wouldn't matter whether my cap is 4.8 or 4.2, my degree classification would be the same.

Why is the CS department intentionally dissuading its students from doing their best? Just because I have different aspirations, it wouldn't matter how well I do I still won't get FCH? I even heard from my friends who graduated from poly that they're exempted half of the industrial experience requirement, so they'd have to extend their ""normal"" candidature to get FCH (since FYP spans two semesters).

Don't even try that bullshit about how ""If you're good enough, degree class doesn't matter"" or ""You're in CS, second upper good enough already"". It does NOT excuse unnecessary structural limitations. And for what? Aren't we already 'filtered' into our corresponding degree classes thanks to the bell curve? Now you add an additional criteria that (1) explicitly removes the academic motivation of your top students with different aspirations; (2) specifically disincentivises your top students from exploring alternative career pathways (e.g. NOC); (3) is extremely prejudiced towards polytechnic graduates. 

With no clear benefit or purpose. Seriously.

If you tell me ""can overload what"" you're not wrong. That's like me telling people less fortunate than me ""why you never work harder"" while closing my eyes to the structural inequality that’s keeping them down in the first place. CS supposed to be full of logical people right? Explain this to me please. I really don't get it."
65758,"Till now, the saddest thing in my life is when you are best friends with your crush, whom has just experienced a break up, but she doesn't even friendzone nor brozone you, but siszone you instead. Im not even considered a male in her eyes... 

Although the ""bf"" space is officially unoccupied, you know that you cant even takeover it. Only thing i can do is stay by her side and comfort her. You sad, i also sad with you. You 借酒消愁 then i shall do it the same with you."

65737,"Amidst all the recent controversies about PMD riders published in the news, let me offer some perspectives, as a PMD rider myself.

Firstly, in case most of u are unaware, pavements or walkways were never exclusive to just walking pedestrians. It's meant to be shared among all users, be it cyclists, walkers, joggers or PMD riders. With this knowledge in mind, you should thus realize that the onus is on you to look out for us as well.

I disagree that it's entirely the fault of riders when accidents happen because pedestrians do not check their backs when walking, neither do they bother to avoid any PMD riders that comes colliding into their paths. The majority fails to understand that non-riders should take up the responsibility as well in order to co-exist with riders. After all, doesn't it take two hands to clap?

Teach the young ones to look out for traffic, not only on the road, but when they're walking along pavements or when they are playing in the park or playground as well. Do not listen to music when walking or jogging in public places and turn your head to check your surroundings and blindspots periodically. Also, try to avoid park connectors as that is where most of us will ride. 

Honestly speaking, I think it is ridiculous to expect us to constantly remember to sound out warnings when we're riding past anyone. We are humans too and we might forget to do so due to the daily stress in our lives that might occupy our mind, be it from work or studies.

Finally, some of u lamented about our speed. If we were to ride at walking speed, then what's the point of having PMDs in the first place if we want to achieve a carlite future where we can still maintain the convenience that comes with the speed of motor vehicles?

Do not forget that most of u make use of food delivery services which makes use extensively of PMD riders. If speed is being compromised, how will u get your orders on time?

Seriously, to those ppl who condemn PMD riders, your perverted sense of entitlement disgusts me."

65700,"To OP of #65670: I’m sorry I laughed after reading ur confession (i didn’t mean to… but it’s quite funny haha) Ok anyways, i always believe that i would be attracted to guys with cute smile, nice body etc. But surprisingly, the first thing that attracted me to my current boyfriend was his optimism, his motivation to strive, his filial self and most importantly, his eloquence. I admit, he isn't a handsome guy AT ALL, or at least not the looks that I'd prefer, and he knows it (simply cos i told him b4 hehe) but my admiration for him increased day by day. Tell you what, looks is just an exterior, go and socialise more, talk to more girls (i don't think they will shoo you if you are just being friendly). But firstly, if ur looks makes the bulk of your confidence level, u should probably go and do a makeover. Get new clothes, change your fashion style etc There are billions of people on earth and i’m sure there will definitely be one girl suited for u. Jiayou!!

P.s nobody likes being around pessimistic people bcos is simply tiring, u need to change your mindset!! Good luck bro"
