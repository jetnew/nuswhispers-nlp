62699,"Dear Dr Jonathan Choi, 

You said that you used to go up and talk to random girls. How was your experience and how did it help you get out of your comfort zone? Did anyone think that it was creepy?"
62698,"It's my first time to be on NUSWhispers, I just found the page quite funny sometimes, so I guess as my uni life has been quite boring, I just wanna share a story here. I'm actually a quite timid girl but I stay positive all the time. I came out from poly, started school when the other girls were all younger than me, they looked young, fresh, humorous and attractive while I was just very ordinary. I like doing things alone. I was quiet all the time in school friends' conversations and people never really remembered me. I realized maybe I was not as attractive as other girls, but it's just fine because I'm happy with who I am. During weekend, as I stay on campus, I usually go to YIH comp lab to study, I enjoy the place so much because I actually feel uncomfortable to be in crowded places like Utown. One day, while I was napping on the table (because I'm doing internship concurrently, I'm really lack of sleep), there was suddenly a guy coming in and somehow that woke me up but I wasn't totally awaken. He asked where the printing station was, and as I was just awake, I really looked silly and you know, I was just acting with my silly face, showing him to check the room next door. Apparently the photocopy room closed long time ago (omg I realized it was a wrong direction), then he came back and told me he didn't find it. So I looked around (I must look very weird at that time I guess), and showed him to check the other comp lab near the toilet. I was waiting outside while he stepped into the room and then luckily the printers were there (okay, now I know where the printers are). He was printing but then looked at me outside the door and smiled with a hand signal like ""it's ok now"". Just like that, he then came back to the lab I was sitting, said thank you and sorry for disturbing my sleep but I just felt embarrassed because even my friends never saw me sleeping or napping before as well. But it's fine until I accidentally bump to him the second time in YIH while ordering food. I don't know why he remembered me and smiled to me. I also remember him but I was just embarrassed so I passed by him very quickly. Then I realized I forgot my drink (omg why I forgot my drink) and came back to the shop where he was sitting nearby. This time I stopped and tried my best to say ""we met... uhm, the printers..., right?"". He smiled and said ""yes, the printers"". After that, I didn't know why but I felt happy because that was the first time someone actually remembered me, a very ordinary, timid, and sound-boring person like me. Again the day before, it's so happening that, I saw him again, that time I was trying my best to actually follow and hope to talk to him again but he was just walking so fast with his friends. I missed him among the crowd... 
""Hi, my first time here and my first time doing this kind of confession. I don't even know your name, your major or anything about you but just want to thank for remembering me. I might look cold and quiet, but I'm not a unfriendly person. So, if there is ever a chance that we meet again, I think I would really ask your name. Jiayous for finals and see you around (hopefully)!"""
62697,"I am thinking of writing cards to my profs this sem since I am graduating and I feel like the profs have really contributed to my learning in university. Do professors like cards?  Is it weird to give cards to profs? I mean, it's like a thing for teachers and profs can be considered teachers as well, right? But more importantly, should I sign off on them or keep them anonymous? I'm taking the module of this prof, and I don't want to seem like I'm buttering her up to get better grades (not that I think she can pick out my paper out of 150 papers). But I do want to give her a card cause she is a really good prof. "
62696,"If i have a bad cap, will doing more internships improve my chances of employment after graduation? Also, what constitutes a ""good"" internship? What else can I do to make up for my bad cap? Thanks in advance!"
62695,"To the guys out there, do you prefer dating girls of similar intelligence or higher than you, or girls who are dumber than you? I've got a feeling that my current bf got together with me because he viewed me as inferior towards him, and it makes me quite sad and pathetic. "
62694,"I am a 30 yo lady who is cheerful, extroverted and has a career that many deem as super meaningful to the society. But I have been in and out of unsuccessful BGRs and I wonder if true love still exists in this era. I wasnt look for much, just someone who is good tempered, truly loves me and has compatible values and interests as me. What do you think?"
62692,"People doing GET1001, is there anyone out there who knows what the hell happened in the tutorials for part 2?!
As a non-geog major, I was absolutely clueless about both the assignments and that really dragged me down. Was wondering if anyone else felt the same or do I need to SU this mod ah"
62691,"Every time I go to the gym, I feel embarrassed to use the bench press or squats station. So when someone else wants to use it, I would usually skip my sets and give up the station to him. 

I just feel like a skinny guy like me shouldn't obstruct the buff lords :("
62689,"What if you were stuck between someone who wants to love you, willing to work hard for your future but that person needs time to grow financially, and someone who want to love you yet is already financially stable?

I would love to hear opinion from all walks of life."
62687,"#62645:  This is regarding this post. I am the girlfriend of guy A. He knows girl B likes her and during a conversation, girl B asks him not to think so much about the relationship. (cause we are rocky lately) Then my gf messaged her "" I am trying to sleep but I am worried about you) How would you guys interpret this message? (given that he knows Girl B is slightly vex with some issues too) 

1. He is trying to sleep. And he is worried about her too.

2. He is worried about her that's he can't sleep.

62680,"I'm the one who posted #62680. Thanks for all the concerns and help in reaching out to talk to me. But i really dont feel comfortable telling my stuffs to people that i just know, it took me some time before i started telling things to my good friend that left, my good friend left because of my negativity and arguement between us, its just so hard to focus on the things that matter now and it just adds on to the stress I'm facing. So I decided , I'm going to go for counselling after finals , because even I , am afraid of myself. The thoughts of ending everything feels so comforting when i feel sad and useless. And sometimes it really hurts to think about what happened between my friend and I, my results, my life and everything. It hurts so much that i really feel my heart aching. So to prevent some things from happening, i will attempt to share everything with the counselor if i feel comfortable enough..."

62674,"I'm having mixed feelings after seeing the SoC boys and girls posts. I'm from SoC and I'm seeing this girl from CEG, and one of my friends who is her coursemate told me that she got a couple of guys seeing her, but she's not interested in them.

62669,"After going for ICT and coming back, I've noticed that each clique or project group has a certain structure, especially if it's made up of (mostly)guys. You'll always have one or more of these people.

1. The Platoon Commander
He takes charge of the group, initiating ideas, study sessions, coordinates outings... You can always depend on him to take the lead on anything, and everyone just seems to go along with it, because it always works out in the end with him. Might also take the lion's share of the work because ""it needs to be done"" and ""Aiya easier for me to do than disturb you all"". Bonus points if he wears his OCS singlet to school or tells a shit ton of ""in my time"" stories.

2. The Platoon Sergeant
He'll be the first to voice concerns and take the lead when the PC is not around. Usually found alone if not with the group, though he fits right in when he's there. Often takes on more than the rest because he believes in leading by example and challenging himself. Might take on extra stuff to add badges to his uniform, like exchanges, double degrees or whatnot. Sometimes bites off more than he can chew and finds himself regretting it in a classic oh shit moment.

3. The Section Commanders
Usually particularly good at one thing, or maybe not really good at many things, but they still try. May make life hard for the PS when they do prove him wrong or put up differing ideas and opinions. Usually found either doing work at the last minute after procrastinating but somehow manages to get it done decently well, or being the first to jump on a major assignment so they can be choose their parts and be done with it then watch the rest suffer through the harder parts. Bonus points if they gossip about the PC and PS among themselves or often go off to take a nap.

4. The Section Members
Sometimes there when things happen, sometimes missing in action, but unfortunately mostly there to tank the saikang. Usually don't say anything and don't contribute much to decisions... But still kena when it comes to doing the work. Bonus points for wearing army tees out, or leaving group messages on ""read"". 

5. The Chao Keng
Never there when you need him. Shows up after all the work and comes up with a million excuses not to do work or contribute. Won't take the saikang, won't be there to clean up, he's the last in but first out. Bonus points if everyone secretly hates him, but is too nice to tell it to his face.

6. The Warrant Officer
Might be your age, but sure talks like he's 50 years old. He does his fair share, but unfortunately that's all he does. Disappears after, and is rarely seen after five. Intentionally schedules all his classes together so he can pang gang earlier. Nobody knows anything about him, he just comes to school, does his part, gets stuff straight and goes home.

7. The Attached-Out Personnel
He's not really part of your clique anymore. He used to show up regularly, but not any more and he's more of a work friend than a real friend by now. Usually has his own group of friends on the side, which he's now ""attached"" to. He doesn't make an effort to meet you guys but you guys are still good. Still shows up to go out sometimes, but usually leaves jios on read or flies aeroplane on you guys. Bonus points if he's dating someone in the new group of friends. 

And the shiny pokemon...

8. The AWOL
You never know where he is, you never know what he's doing, and he doesn't even read, let alone reply, text messages. He just went home one day and that was the last you heard of him. You only intermittently hear of him appearing somewhere or you only see an empty seat during finals. Bonus points if he somehow manages to be still on the nominal row the next semester and you're just wondering how he's not slapped with an academic warning yet.

You might be one of them, you might be more than one of them, or you might be none of them. The only constant you know is that no matter what course you're in, you're going to hear about at least one Chao Keng.

If you don't, then I've got bad news for you."
62659,"Is it bad for a CS student to forget Math modules leant 2 or 3 semesters ago?

62655,"Recently, NUS geography sent a “reassurance” email regarding the departure of several geography professors. Honestly not sure how I feel about this but surely, I don’t feel “so good” (or “assured”). I believe many of the Geography majors are also aware that this does not bring any good news or comfort. Some of our beloved and favourite professors are leaving NUS for good and we are deeply saddened. While it is clearly for the advancement in their careers, I am curious as to their motivations in leaving the institute and role of the university/department in any attempts to retain our best talents and professors. It feels like someone (“Thanos” maybe) just snapped and wiped them out. How can a department in the top 10 global ranking experience such drastic changes? 

Clearly, with the situation in the departmental office, there is bound to have some repercussions on the learning experience and opportunities (modules, research projects and HT) for students. No form of “assurance” is enough until we see the “promised” changes. Already, less and less modules are available for students over the year. Just look at the modules previously listed on the Geography department webpage and as a geography student you will already know that some of them are no longer offered. In addition, this also means that more students are competing for the remaining modules available whether by choice or not. Inevitably, this also have effects on class size and learning environments. Before taking a level-4000 module, I always thought that the classes will be different and more seminar-style like sessions similar to some of the higher level classes I have been on for exchange. However, I was easily proven wrong and the sheer size of the classes just meant that conducive learning environments for open discussions is difficult. 

Any students who have to face the fact that their department is losing some of their best professors will surely be saddened and disappointed. Maybe... “Some people move on, but not us”. These beloved professors will continue to hold a place in our hearts.

So much has be done more than promised. Nonetheless, going forward, existing and new incoming professors assembled by the department have to do whatever it takes to continue to maintain the standards and legacy set by the leaving professors. This is by no means an easy feat and I sincerely hope the best for the department."
62652,"I would love to get Prof Ben Leong or Jordan Mattson's advice here - How would you recommend dealing with companies that insist on seeing your payslips before they can proceed with a job offer?

I am have 10+ years of experience and have been interviewing for mid to senior roles in software engineering. I am in the late stages with a large finance / fintech firm, but they insist on knowing my current comp and seeing my payslips before they can proceed with an offer.

I make around 200 k in my current role as an engineering lead. Besides money, my job offers incredible autonomy. I pretty much get to dream up and execute projects on my own. I have amazing work life balance: I work remote 90% of the time and can easily fulfil expectations working 5-10 hours a week on average.   

In spite of these benefits, I have been looking for a role that is more senior and challenging. But I want to make sure that when I trade jobs, it's worth it in terms of compensation vs hours worked: and as such, I have been targeting roles that can pay around 350 - 400 k.

After many (8-10) rounds of interviews, pretty much everyone sees me as having the perfect background and skills for the new role. Early in the process, I confirmed with the (third-party) recruiter that the role does in fact have a budget of up to 400k.

Throughout the interview process, the recruiter was insistent on knowing my current compensation. They also emphasised that the company's standard policy is to pay an increment of say, 15-20%. I have successfully managed to deflect the question of my current salary up until now. 

The recruiter repeatedly ""warned"" me to keep my expectation in line with their increment range, and cited many candidates (for other roles in firms like this) who were asked for much more than the standard increment range and were promptly turned down. They repeatedly asked me for assurances that I'm not one of these candidates who is asking for a ""crazy"" increment.

At this point, I'm afraid that if I let them know my current comp, the deal will fall apart. As a data point, I interviewed with a different company in the same peer group as this one last year and made it to the offer stage. They insisted on seeing my payslips before making an offer, and sure enough they offered a 25% raise.

What are my options at this point? The difference between what I'm asking for and what I make is enormous, but my current situation in terms of work life balance is not reflected in my payslips.

We were on the discussion about what guys will do if they like a girl, and my crush supplemented that most guys will send a meme to the girl they like. Jokingly, I asked in mock offence why he doesn't send me memes, and he said, ""Well I guess that means..."" (either jokingly or not). While my friends and I all laughed, passing it off as a joke, I was secretly sad. Was that a hint? Do I have no chance at all and doomed in the friendzone?

But if you’re a SOC guy interested in a SOC girl who’s already told you she’s single and dropped you a few hints she may be interested, please stop waiting around and make a move already!

To #62642: If you don’t get why guys should take the initiative, it’s very simple. An average girl in uni usually has more than one guy interested in her at any one time. Some of these guys would be actively pursuing her, and taking up her time and attention away from you. Unless she has the opportunity to get to know you for an extended period of time (like what happened with me and my boyfriend), her interest in you would have already peaked and faded some time after meeting you. If you don’t make the 1st move, she might never get the chance to know you better. So if a guy wants to play the waiting game and wait for the girl to make the 1st move, good luck to him!

62633,"I actually need some relationship advice, and no, it's not exactly the usual kind of r/s drama. My case is quite difficult, that's why I'm conflicted on what I should do. Let me start from the beginning. 

I met this girl at a bar last year, she was still in Singapore at that time. She is a uni student from the US, and she was just visiting as tourist with her friends. We befriended each other over the course of the 1 week she was here and I showed her around. Unfortunately, she had to return back to her country of course. Over the next few days we talked a lot through the phone and eventually, our friendship blossomed to romance (very prematurely, in hindsight). But as I got to know her more, I realized the she wasn't the one for me as I'm starting to lose interest in her (we do not like the same things, we can't keep up a conversation, we're not compatible basically). I'm starting to get bored too actually. Don't get me wrong, I believe that I CAN stand the distance, I'm actually a really patient guy. It's just that our incompatibility is making the distance more unbearable as each and every day I can feel her emotional connection slipping away from me. Take note, I realized that I don't like her as a girlfriend, but she makes a good friend. I still care about her.

Here's where the trouble comes in. 
I want to tell her all these things, right? I don't want to waste her time, and I don't want to waste my own time too. But I feel OBLIGED to stay with her. Why? Because 

1) She has already booked a plane ticket to see me in 4 months, by HERSELF. 

2) At the same time, I don't know if I can wait any longer because 4 months is a very long time. 

She said to me once, if I ever leave her she would just block me because she still loves me very much and it would hurt her. So asking if she could be my friend instead is out of the question. There is no way she could come to Singapore as a friend.

If I break things off with her now, what is she going to do? I don't want to waste her money for nothing. She still loves me a lot, I don't want her to come here by herself with a broken heart. 

Any advice on what I could do? Wait it out or break it off? "

However, today my insurance sent me a letter saying the other party claimed 50k. I was shocked so I called and ask. The insurance said the car repair fee is less than 3k but the other party did full body check up and incurred 40k plus, including no pay leave etc. He claimed he got neck pain, back pain, butt pain, everywhere pain... so he did a lot checkup.

It’s so ridiculous. I was just starting my car and my speed is not even 10km/hr when I knock him. Furthermore, he is the driver (not even in the backseat). Also, when knocked into him, he immediately ran down to confront me. I don’t see him have any visible discomfort. Also, the impact is literary a small dent on his car. It’s not as if I crash into him. 

I’m so pissed off right now. What should I do? I don’t want pay 50k because my car insurance premium confirm will go up if I pay. Also, I’m so angry at his dishonesty to abuse insurance to do free body checkup.

62616,#62587 I used CMB for a while and so far I only got 2 matches. One of them left the chat after 2 days and another one said not to talk anymore because I looked like her friend's ex. Pretty bad experience thus far.
62615,"There is this one EE/CEG dude that often wears the 'weekdays' shirts, like literally 'monday' 'tuesday' right smack in the middle of his shirt. I find him cute and handsome but i'm shy... any advice out there to getting to break the ice?"
62613,"Alluring Silence

Lies hidden beneath my feeling
Is the image of us holding hands
The warmth we both longed for
As we listens to the beauty of silence

""Will you be here for me?""
Your soft whisper flowing through the cold night
""Yes my dear...""

As our eyes gaze through the dark horizon
Let the light of the stars shines through your heart
Yet can it pleases your mortal longings for ravishing sight?

To witness your smile, even from a distant,
scribbled thousands of reasons one can imagine
to get closer and know you more..
the sweet princess of my desire

Ah... the alluring sounds of silence
Let it be the witness of us holding hands
As my whisper elegantly draw a picturesque smile on your cute face..
""I love you, my dear""

62612,Hi admin please dont filter my post... Is checking whether my cert accredited by government important in finding job? Im wondering how employers will look at my cert accreditation first or my skills first. Im finding another university to study after graduating from NUS so seeking advice here. Tq
62611,"Regarding #62545 What i meant was, because that question (6) got voided and i spent time doing it, i was not able to complete the next question(7) as no more time.
Compare this to those students who skipped 6 and did 7.
They get marks for both! Now do you see the unfairness? I lost marks for q7!!"
62609,"Hi everyone, I will be matriculating into a PhD programme at NUS and my scholarship expects me to maintain an average of B+ for all modules. May I know if this is manageable, especially when I will be taking graduate modules and competing with other smart grad students? Please don't filter, I am quite anxious about it. "
62607,"I recently interviewed a master engineering grad from one of the top local uni for my startup. Superb academic records on the cv and all the scholarships one could hope for. The cv was filled with several internship records too. I picked some of the internships and asked for more details, but there was no details. Said there wasn't much done at the internships. When asked about hands-on skills, there was none. Any project done as a student? ""Don't remember anything"". I was glad that at least the candidate didn't make anything up. ""I am willing to learn anything."" Said the candidate. We are a startup, I told the candidate, so not only we need someone who is better than us, but also you have to understand the extremely challenging work environment we are going to... ""Sorry what's a startup?"" The candidate interrupted. And it was at that point, I realized the conversation needed to end. I thought about this for days, and there is no one good way to explain my feeling about this. To list some of my thoughts: (1) If you seriously don't know what you want for a career, just sign up for the graduate hires at bigger and more established corporations or the public sector; they'll take you however useless you are as long as you show the grades. (2) Don't put things that you can't explain in your cv, unless you want to get destroyed quickly. (3) Many of the parents who told their child to focus on nothing but studies were from a different generation where uni graduates were kinda guaranteed decent jobs; most of them stay in their current jobs their entire adult life, and job hunting is something they never had to deal with. They do not understand the job market we are facing today, so please don't take updated career advice blindly."
62605,"Girl who posted #62605 here. I’m very happy in my current relationship. So nope, I’m not looking for anyone to PM or date me. But if you’re a SOC guy interested in a SOC girl who’s already told you she’s single and dropped you a few hints she may be interested, please stop waiting around and make a move already!

To #62642: If you don’t get why guys should take the initiative, it’s very simple. An average girl in uni usually has more than one guy interested in her at any one time. Some of these guys would be actively pursuing her, and taking up her time and attention away from you. Unless she has the opportunity to get to know you for an extended period of time (like what happened with me and my boyfriend), her interest in you would have already peaked and faded some time after meeting you. If you don’t make the 1st move, she might never get the chance to know you better. So if a guy wants to play the waiting game and wait for the girl to make the 1st move, good luck to him! If it happens, he’s a very lucky guy. 

To #62634: You sound like the typical sweet but hopeless/clueless SOC guy I mentioned before. If you’re trying to read and analyse your girlfriend like a computer program, please stop. Girls are more complex than just a bunch of 1s and 0s. Also not all communications are verbal. If your girlfriend is exasperated, it’s because you’re only paying attention to what she says, not what she communicates. There’s a difference. If she loves you enough, she’ll try to teach you. If you love her enough, you’ll try to learn. Good luck!"
62604,"To the guy who switched the fan on for me during the 9am exam today (29th),
Thank you very much!!! It was a very touching action and it honestly made my day :) "
