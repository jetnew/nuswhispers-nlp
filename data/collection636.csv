63699,"Asking for advice - I recently started my first software engineering internship at a start up and was thrown into both frontend and backend with different team leads. There's only a few girls inside the Products/SE team and I am one of them. 
One of the team lead is somewhat irritating? He would grab my notebook that I use to jot down what was discussed etc and read off it, but I don't see him doing that to other engineers (both interns and full-time). He's very pushy to get updates in general. Daily scrum is practiced but he would still walk one round in the office to ""check in"" with all the engineers before lunch and after lunch. 
Also, he keeps assigning me work that would require me to work with him/his team, even though the plan is for me to work with the other team permanently. Furthermore, there's a SE intern who started the same time as me said that team lead was not assigning him work and did not bother to check in with him too.

Am I overthinking it? And what should I do to get him to be less irritating in a nice way?"
63697,"All this debate about girls having high expectations but I don't think anybody has actually bothered to clarify what they mean by 'high expectations'. Obviously not all expectations are equal, and we lose a lot of nuance when we don't bother to explain what constitutes a ""high expectation""- our disagreement might owe to a simple misunderstanding of what these expectations are. On that note, there are clearly certain expectations that are perfectly reasonable (and even healthy) to have of your SO. For example, you should expect your SO to be trustworthy and to respect you and your life choices. There are also aesthetic expectations: things like my SO needs to be at least this tall, at least this good looking, go to the gym etc. These expectations don't make you a bad person, and you have every right to have them - even if they do make you come off as a bit shallow (especially if these expectations are more important to you than character considerations). 

But of course there are also expectations that are completely unreasonable and unfair to have of your SO. Nobody should expect their SO to be at their beck and call 24/7, or for their SO to spend every cent of their money on them. These expectations are not healthy to have in any committed relationship, and are usually the result of a sense of overly narcissistic self-entitlement by one party, and a lack of self-respect by the other (if they choose to stay with that narcissist). I don't believe anybody, regardless of which party they are, can actually be happy in such a relationship. The question isn't whether there are unfair expectations held by certain people in Singapore (there most certainly are) but rather: where do we draw the line on what should we consider an unreasonable expectation? And how many people actually hold these unreasonable expectations?"
63696,"I think I need to seek advice. I have this thought that I don’t need a boyfriend since I’ve always been single for the past twenty something years. I have a close sister whom I will do all the crazy stuffs with and I genuinely feel happy and very much myself. But I know humans are social being, and not having a relationship at all cannot be the thing forever. Maybe some years later, my relatives will start nagging at me to settle for a partner in life, and I will be envious of others holding hands in street...but the thought of “I can be single and genuinely happy” is real, but it don’t seems to be a good sign either. How to overcome this thoughts?"

63692,"LADIES! How do you get your boyfriend to listen to you during arguments or just when you want him to? A recent news report shows that these are the most powerful words you can say to your boyfriend and you will immediately get his attention and impact his mind and body. So please, before fighting, try these first!:

1. ""I love you""
2. ""I want us to work""
3. ""Please, I want to talk about this and not run away from it""
4. ""Ah gennerman, you walk, you walk somemore""
5. ""Ah you take your time, you take your BLOODY time""
6. ""F*** you understand?""
7. ""Eh the whole bloody battalion waiting for you you know!""
8. ""Gennerman, you better wake up your bloody idea""
9. ""Do I can I make myself clear?""
10. ""You think, I thought, who confirm?""
11. ""Eh don't come and make your problem my problem""
12. ""Gennerman, you give me 1x good one, we call it a day""

63688,"I recently started to try CMB after hearing/seeing some success stories. I’ve had some matches, but out of all the matches, I only had proper conversations with a few people and the convos didnt even last long. 

I used to think that i should wait for the guy to initiate a convo, but i soon realised that i should make some effort myself if i really wanted something to work out. So i did try to start convos once i matched with someone, but i almost never get a reply back from those. 

I’ve never been in a relationship before neither have i tried these kinda dating apps, so i just wanted to know if this is normal? And also, when guys like someone, do they actually really think of the other party as a possible catch or like they’re just liking to see if they’ll get liked back or what?

I know for myself that I’m a below average girl so I’m not expecting to get many likes, but if someone liked me, I’d expect that the other party is actually interested to get to know me? Yet somehow conversations dont even happen. I’m so confused. 

Anyone has any advices?"
63686,"Ditto to #63686. I think the materialistic, self-serving attitudes of some (definitely not all!) Singaporean women drive us men to look overseas. I've dated locals who stayed for years but bailed the moment things got tough and the future prospects I initially seemed on track to materialising fell into uncertainty. 

I'm now married to a Polish woman, who accepted me despite knowing I have multiple sclerosis (which was what made my previous ex leave), and despite my continued inability to pronounce her nearly vowel-less last name. To further shatter the notion that only poor foreign women from second-/third-world countries would readily accept any half-decent Singaporean guy for money or citizenship, my wife came from a well-to-do family. She left behind her life of relative luxury to come here and slog it out with me. She also has a masters degree while I only have my 2.1 bachelors; nonetheless, she's planning to put her career on hold to take care of our kids, or to be the sole breadwinner if my currently mild MS takes a turn for the worse. 

Antagonism is never far away when a relationship/love is contingent on material expectations. In fact, i'd say it's better to not have expectations beyond those about character, personality etc. Basically, love somebody for who they are, not what they can or cannot achieve. Unconditional love, far from making both parties lazy and unmotivated, might actually drive them to achieve and provide for each other. I certainly feel that way. I'm more motivated now to work hard and provide for my wife and future kids than I ever was when I was alone, or in past relationships where I was pressured with expectations. 

P.S. for the fellow introverts who are wondering how we met, it was on Chatroulette which is probably the unlikeliest of places to meet your other half. And no I wasn't flashing my junk. :)"
63682,"Is there a way to refrain your gf from clubbing or drinking too much?? I've been with her since JC and she wasn't into all these stuff back then reason, she was obviously underage then and her parents were quite strict on her. But since enrolling into university for 2 years or so, she made so many new friends (yeap she is quite sociable by nature), most of them are guys which i lowkey get jealous whenever she hangs out with them. I've spoken to her a few times regarding this issue but she always goes like YOLO YOLO. She has invited me a few times but i hated the environment so i started rejecting her after my first try. I've offered to give her a lift home and she just needs to give me a call after she is done but she reassured me that it's ok and she will be fine since she stays near the clubs or bars she is going.

Didn't know that there was this side of her when we first dated. Now im constantly worried for her safety and health. She was out last night again and just received a text from her about the cancellation of our movie date due to her hangover. I dont wish this problem to cause more tension in the future, or worse, a break up as she is the perfect girl for me, other than the problem mentioned above so any advice on how i can make her reduce the frequency she is out to those places?"
63681,"MGTOW is a rational choice for local men nowadays, why spend your time, energy and money on getting a poor deal in relationships with princesses when you should be enjoying your 20s and 30s? 

Instead spend the time on yourself, enjoying your freedom and hobbies. You will be amazed by how much time, money and you have when it isn't sucked away by an entitled partner. Spend that time developing yourself and when you are ready you can date people from places that offer a much better deal.

MGTOW is about knowing your worth and not selling yourself short. Live your life free of someone else's entitlement and unrealistic expectations."

63670,"This is to all the girls having high expectations of their current/future boyfriends out there.

From a genuinely curious male, what do you girls bring to the table in your relationships (that will actually benefit the male) to warrant such high expectations?

Education? Guys have similar education standards, so what makes you so special? Conversely, if you lack education, why would higher educated guys settle for you?

Financial Independence? Then back up your words by paying for 50% of the house and car. There is no functional difference in a wife that earns 2k or 10k a month if she refuses to spend a cent on things that both parties share.

Taking care of the child and cooking? Monthly maid payments are less than 1k last I checked. 

Please don't mention companionship as we all know that is a 2 way street. 

If you demand so much from the male, be prepared for him to demand the same things from you as well. We want to be boyfriends, not sugar daddies. Males can be generous, but we absolutely dislike relationships on unequal terms where we feel like we are getting taken advantage of.

We are all for gender equality, but please remember that equal rights begets equal responsibilities."

63661,"Aiyah actually all the latest confessions about love can be summed up very simply. The girl in that recent post that got really popular was wrong on many things: incessantly looking down on foreign girls, equating love with money, wanting to be the man's equal (or better) in the relationship but refusing to pay an equal amount, etc. But she did get one thing very very right.

""you are what you attract"". (Not ""you are what you hope you attract"", which she conflates the two -- that's called wishful thinking. I have Scarlett Johansson/10 years ago Joanne Peh standards, means I am them meh? Maybe only my mom would think so.) Go look it up - there are studies that show that people by and large go for their general matches. Socioeconomic match, looks-wise match in particular. Of course you can trade some in either direction but as a rule of thumb not even a billion dollars will turn you from Quasimodo into Li Nanxing (unless you go do surgery lah, but that's a topic for another time. This one not thesis.)

So, long story short, all this debate is not very useful. No amount of hand wringing will challenge the primal human need to preserve social status. If you want rich and hot, better be rich and hot. Otherwise, good luck, no matter how much you insist on high standards, it's not likely going to happen. If you want just hot, you also need to be hot. If you want just rich, you also usually need to be rich (maybe the most flexible one, but still - think about the rich couples you know, and the proportion of them that are actually socioeconomically lopsided.)

Or maybe, just maybe ........... you realize that finding a real life partner to love and to have goes above and beyond these things. That you don't need either of these things to have a loving and happy relationship. 

If you want loving and understanding and supportive and committed, be loving and understanding and supportive and committed. That's the real ""you are want you attract"". It's the most important one. And happily, it's also the one attainable by everyone."

This platform allows people to voice out their concerns and seek advice anonymously. I believe they are seeking support from people they do not know ( the commenters ), often because they have no one to go to for help, or fear being judged. 

We all face different issues and perceive things differently. Instead of commenting remarks that can cause the OP to feel even worse or helpless, even bashed. I think we should try to offer proper support. Of course, they are many who are kind enough to offer their sympathy and advice.

You wish not to be generalized, but aren't you playing the exact same game with millions of people from elsewhere? Please don't throw others under the bus to grandiose your self-esteem.

It is the underlying subtle ""Singaporean superiority complex"" that you write with, that irks me. Perhaps you should learn to travel and interact with people outside of your bubble more often so that you may hopefully have a deeper sense of perspective of things.

63649,"Regarding the topic on angmoh, I just want to point out that angmoh are not as rich as you think... 

I have many angmoh friends and relatives in the States, they are freaking not rich. Ironically they are poor by Asian standard. 

Bill Gates, Steve Jobs etc aside, a typical white is definitely not as rich as what most girls perceive. So what’s causing this false perception? 

Answer: angmoh like to spend. They like to splurge and spend forward money. On the surface, of course girls will think they are rich because angmoh pamper them with gifts, pay their meal, bring them go diving etc... 

A lot Singaporean girls have the false notion that dare to splurge = rich. It’s a ridiculous idea. I have angmoh friends who wear suit and tie, drive Maserati (FYI still cheaper than a Singapore Toyota if factor in COE), splurge on high end restaurant. At the end of the month, he can’t even pay his utility bill or car gas. And this is extremely common in the States. 

For Asian guys, we like to save money for rainy days. To us, 未雨绸缪 is a virtue. Obviously we are not gonna be splurging like angmoh and bring you girls to fanciful places to eat or play. But to girls, they will feel not splurging = poor, stingy and not loving. 

C’mon girls, if you like the thrill of temporary gratification and worry about electrical bill every month, by all means go for white guys. Asian guys don’t want girls like you. 

Being rich is not about the spending habit, it’s about who has the financial buffer to fork out money during unforeseen situation like when your Mum is in A&E"
63643,"To #63617 – the girl who sets expectation. Thankfully you know that you don’t represent the entire population of females in Singapore because what you said don’t represent me, a fellow Singaporean female. 

1.	I have things in my life that I believe in and I think it’s important for the partner to have similar believe to work things out. Most importantly, I believe it’s important for couples to communicate openly about what can be done, cannot be done, and all types of expectations. A couple should give each other the ownership to make a decision if the expectations set on each other were realistic, or not. 
I don’t set expectations because I realised everyone is unique. I went through what you did, and earning at least $4,000 per month on my own without depending on anyone. My parents gave me the power to be financially independent too. But the question is, to me $4k make me financially independent, don’t you think $2k would also make someone else financially independent? Being financially independent or not is a CHOICE. I can be earning $4k and splurge on luxury goods and complain that I don’t have enough money to spend while someone earning $2k could be saving up for the future by buying only what’s needed. 

2.	You wish to marry a rich angmoh but I don’t. Yes, of course I hope I will get a 12 million TOTO, but it won’t stop me from wanting to work hard and earn that $4k per month because I felt that it’s important to be able to look forward to something everyday at work, and at home – I need motivation and goals to keep me going as a human and if being rich is going to make me lazy, then I rather not be. I love to enjoy with what I earn, and that’s when I can really enjoy it. Oh and if I really get the 12 million TOTO, I would definitely keep a portion to myself, but the rest to my parents or charities that need help. Because I am not stopping my life just for that 12 million.


3.	I was brought up with a lot of love from everyone, family, friends, teachers and whoever you listed. Because everyone CAN love and everyone probably know how to love in their own ways. Nobody will teach you how to love, because you don’t learn it, you feel it. Did you love your family and friends because they teach you how to love? No, you naturally attracted to them and love them. Don’t compare yourself to some village girl because I think village girl would know love way better than you do. If I need to compare standards, I think a village girl would live happier than you are living now. 

4.	At least for the boys I met, I realised I can have the most perfect guy in the world, but yet I still don’t feel happy. I used to set expectations saying I need to get a guy who earns more, who has a degree, who has this and that. I met one, I got together, and it failed. He has everything I want and met all the standards and expectation I have. But I realised I was put in a position to constantly chase for perfection in order to stay within the expectation. It starts to get tiring that our relationship revolves around our expectation and standards and not our feelings first. Can you live up to your own standards and expectations in the first place? I doubt do. Since you are talking about love, and you love your friends and families, does your friends who earn higher than you need to pay for your meals as well? If no, why does your boyfriend need to? Are you looking for a boyfriend or sugar daddy? Yes, please face the wall because no guys should meet a girl like you.


5.	And I need to tell you, your standards are not realistic. It’s expectations and standards that you imposed on other people and wants them to meet. Relationship is not about the boyfriend making her feel like she can fight for the better, but it’s to ways. Don’t you think that a “perfect future” built together is better than a current reality that’s already built by the guy, and you are just like a passer by walking pass it? You own none of it. You are just like a tenant looking for a bunglow to stay in when you only own a condo. If you already own a bunglow and looking for another bunglow to stay in, you will only compare to see whose property is better and find fault with another bunglow. Because you don’t own it. 

6.	Don’t contradict yourself by saying you want someone who allow you to be more successful than him, if you have the capability to do so. Because from the way you are talking about yourself, your boyfriend will soon become of lower standards and not meet your expectations and you will impose more on your boyfriend. Tell me about sharing burden when you say you want to laze off by getting a rich ang moh. Tell me about sharing burden when you expects him to pay for your meals. Don’t talk about equality when you expects the opposite gender to do something for a girl because that is your expectation them.


7.	Trust me, not meeting your standards and expectations doesn’t make those liars, cheater or cowards. They just have their own way of living that make themselves happy. 
You know what girl? As a fellow Singaporean female, I am pretty ashamed to read this post of yours. Get a life and start exploring the world and meet all kinds of people, know their stories, before you start imposing your own opinions on them. From the way you are writing, I can safely say I am probably way more successful than you are and I never once had that kind of expectations and standards you are talking about. I can also safely say without these expectations, I am living happily, never once any emo over any social media platforms. I have great family and friends who love me for who I am, and most importantly a fiance who dotes on me a lot despite him earning lesser than me and not a rich angmoh. We always split our bills, we pay for our upcoming expenses all together and I felt a strong sense of ownership to our relationship. 

Good luck to whoever your future boyfriend is. I hope you will be able to learn from your next boyfriend on what love is and eventually realised how setting expectations and standards is not the only way to find your life partner."
63642,"Honestly looking at all these posts and comments looking down on foreign girls is really disrespectful. 
Dating a foreign girl means I have to feed her whole kampung?? 
Foreign girls are poor and want to date singaporean guys just for the passport?? 
Foreign girls will not work and just wait for the guy to feed her?? 

What kind of outdated mindset is this? 
Have you not seen a non-singaporean woman work in a decent job before? 
Does the world only consist of third-world countries where everyone lives in villages to you? 
There are first world countries out there like Singapore if you didn’t know. The girls there can be as smart and independent as singaporean girls, but they also treat men very well. Generalising a country’s women is one thing, but generalising almost the whole world’s women is on a whole new level. 

Just because we are lucky enough to be born in Singapore does not mean that we can look down on others and think we are the best in everything. I suspect that there are users on this page who lack perspective and might have stayed on this tiny island their whole life."

63634,"#63606: a rather odd advice from numerous studies, anecdotes, and personal experience for couples who can engage in sexual intercourse to keep the relationship stable is this: put sex on a schedule. Like, we'll do it on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and then you stick to the schedule. That's just a suggestion but the idea is try and start with as often as the one with the higher libido wants, then taper down. Very often the partner who want less will adapt. It doesn't matter that on the scheduled day neither of you are ""in the mood"", just do it.

The idea is simple. Sex creates a hormonal reaction. Sex over a stable schedule keeps the hormone stable. Sex on a varied frequency wrecks the hormonal stability and it will cause mood swings and conflicts. No sex altogether in that case is actually better than intermittent sex. I used to date this girl and we had frequent sex, then after a fight, we stopped and decided to continue dating without sex, holding it off until at least after marriage. We fought more frequently afterwards and eventually breaking it off.

Afterwards I date my now-wife. One of the key to our dating life was that we decided very early on the boundary and schedule of our sexual activity. It was much smoother. After marriage and a stream of stable sex, I kinda mellow out and becomes much more sensible and sensitive. I caught myself crying to emotional movies I used to kinda snickered at when I was younger (I know Code Geass R2 was kinda stupidly written but why do I keep crying?). I became much less of an asshole than I was.

Then I also understand why young girls seems to prefer older married men over their single peers. Married men, just by the fact that they are generally satisfied sexually, are calmer, more sensitive, relaxed, and confident. They are also not desperately trying to get into a girl’s pants as soon as possible.  That’s more attractive.

In short, if you can communicate and negotiate a schedule to your sex while not totally preclude the “spur of the moments” that you both want, then it will solve most of the problem. This is the PG version of my advice, I have other R-rated advices that might get filtered here. If you want to hear it, drop an email at adam.wong.aw.126227@gmail.com"

I don't know what to do. Should I try to rekindle things or allow him/her to live his/her life? This is making me miserable. I really like him/her, and I really hope that this is something special but I don't want it to be at the expense of my happiness."

63625,"I am a guy and I have a secret fear about growing old. Many people have been surprised by how much younger I look than my age. I was frequently mistaken to be a JC student when I am a y4 student now and I must say I enjoyed all that attention and praises. What I have not told anyone is that I spend a great deal of research and money on cosmetics and skincare that could easily rival that of a girl's. I am really worried that I will grow an uncle's face and body, become fat and bald as I get older. I have seen photos of some people in their late 20s are they are already look like that. I really don't want to end up being like them. Is there anything I can do other than plastic surgery if it really happens?"

Reason why we broke up was cos I don’t see us together in the future as a married couple,I wrote him a Long letter when we broke up thanking him for taking care and loving me and teaching me how to love. He was devastated.. he contacted my bff to know More about what had happened with me when I cut off off contact with him  3 months later, and know tt I had a a bf. Till this day i feel guilty though I did things right.长痛不如短痛，hurt him hard and let him go find his happiness."
63621,"Is it a norm to lose your friends one by one when you are attached and worse, after you get married? Especially for a guy. I have been attached for 3 years and all my friends have drifted apart from me. Now I feel like I only have my girlfriend to talk things with and it seems more difficult to even jio people out. I understand that you have to distance yourself from other girls but other guy friends seem also have distanced themselves away from me. I kind of missed the camaraderie we used to have and it will be great to keep a bunch of good friends but I have none. I know people are more closed off to reconnect with old friends/ making new friends as they age and I heard all those tales of married people in the end only have their family and work colleagues for company. Should I just accept the inevitable fate?"

63611,"With the onslaught of negative matters that has been putting NUS, its staff and its students in the limelight for the wrong reasons recently, especially with the endless rants and complains about certain modules’ teaching methodology that are publicly shared online here, a group of us who were privileged enough to attend IS1103 under the guidance of Prof. Jorge Sanz in the recent semester would instead, for a change, like to write this email to offer our sincere thanks and commendation to Prof. Sanz for his dedication in teaching. Throughout the semester, Prof. Sanz has been nothing short of impeccable in imparting his wealth of knowledge to us and going the extra mile out of class to ensure that we could foster a better appreciation for the material covered in class and how it applied in the real world.


While debating on the topic of fair and ethical usage of data analytics in our weekly tutorials, the class was discussing on real life examples of companies who publicly displayed their stance towards responsible usage of customer’s data. Prof. Sanz kindly offered to help us schedule a meeting with DBS on his own initiative, so that we could bring the discussion out of the classroom and into the real world where we could see for ourselves why responsible usage of customer’s data is such a pertinent and critical matter for giant cooperations such as DBS and witness how they went about in managing such a delicate and sensitive issue. 


This meeting materialized into a very enriching and fruitful discussion with the head of Business Solutions, Analytics Centre of Excellence at DBS his team. All of us were absolutely fascinated by the paradigm shift that ensued as a result of our discussion with DBS. We learnt about the guiding principles and frameworks that DBS employs regarding the responsible usage of their customer’s data and were astonished to realise that what we once thought of as a simple ethical conundrum was actually an intricate issue with many different angles and dimensions to consider. This undeniably painted a better picture of how applicable what we learnt in the module was towards how big players on the outside comply with industry standards and formulate their own policies to better manage such issues. 


Outside of class, Prof. Sanz was always more than happy to engage in discussion about the many related queries we had about what we talked about in class and dedicated his time to help us understand the what was covered in tutorials and lectures. His passion for teaching and for nurturing really allowed us to understand the importance of ethics and morals that we must employ in todays’ world and in our future careers. Prof. Sanz is extremely meticulous and diligent when he teaches and goes in-depth so as to allow us to better understand the
complexities of todays’ technology. Observing him teach with such passion and enthusiasm has definitely allowed us to better appreciate the module and become much more interested in the content -- Afterall, it is inevitable that ethics will be a subject that constantly gets brought up in our ever-changing landscape.

That being said, all in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the module and would recommend it to anyone looking to broaden their horizons on the impact of IT on organisation and society. Anyone who is lucky enough to read this module under Prof. Sanz is definitely in for a treat!"
63610,"I hope those post that praises foreign girls are not written by those calculative guys.

I am a child of a typical China mum and a typical Singaporean dad. (So for this post, the “foreign” will be referred to China woman since I am more aware of the culture from those sides) 

While I acknowledge that generally it is true that foreign girls are more capable “internally”, pros about singaporean woman: They are more capable “externally”. Take for example, most China girls can cook a good food, but they are less financially independent than singaporean woman. Your gotta acknowledge that those foreign girls while seeking relationship or what so called “true love” here, no doubt that they are also here for currency and citizenship. My 20+ Cousin came here to get married a 40+ Uncle so that she can get the citizenship, work and live here to pay her parents back home. When my mum first came here, it was also because of the currency back then. 

While there may still be expectation that guys pay a little bit more out of generosity or generally because they receive a higher pay than female counterparts, it is more possible to settle for 50-50 resemblance than if you were to married a foreign woman. 


From my observation, foreign girls are prettier, more capable “internally”, can cook good food. But singaporean woman are more financially independent. Everyone has 24 hrs a day, if you are better in one areas, you can be worse off in another. If you expect a lady to take care of the chores internally, cook for you and take care of the kids after work (and you think you only need to contribute and take care of your finances, and REFUSE to share your financial resources) they will turn to be 黄脸婆 one day. Or if you think from their POV, what makes you think that you only need to work, while they need to BOTH WORK AND CARE INTERNALLY?

Conclusion: both pros and cons from both sides. Everyone has 24 hrs a day. If you are better in an areas, you are worse off in another. 
(1)If you 图 foreign woman to take care of your living, support you emotionally and your kids, then you gotta share your financial resources. 
(2)If you are more reluctant to share your financial resources, you married a more financial independent woman. With that, you care for you own living, equal responsibility for kids and chores, equal status, but pros sides, she helps with carrying the financial burden.

63609,"I'm a Malaysian Chinese NUS undergraduate, wanna share some grandmother story. Hopefully admin won't delete this.

My parents grew up in poverty in some village in Malaysia, so did their siblings. They would have to help out with household chores in addition to studies, and at midnight before going to school, they would cut rubber at the family run plantation. All of them did not have full education (finished SPM, O Level equivalent) then went off to work.

My parents came to singapore, started from factory workers and clerks in the late 80s. (My aunt told me her starting pay was SGD$300 back in 1990s, with exchange rate roughly 1 SGD to 1.2 MYR)

Luckily, it was a good decision for my family who was really poor. 

My uncles and aunts either chose to work in Singapore or in KL. Most of them ended up doing business and made good living, while one of them overacheived ended up the GM of a MNC in KL. 

There was a period of time in my teens, I was not grateful. I grumbled that although my Dad made decent money (we have a car), but we lived in a very small flat. I displayed signs of personality deficiency, not only was I ungrateful, and I also felt inferior to people loving in bigger houses. I envied my uncles and aunts who were both richer and poorer than my family as they still lived in a bigger house.

That changed, when I was did NS here. I became grateful, that my parents chose to come over. With a bit of suffering (now I look back, it wasn't really a suffering compared to my parents days), I learnt to appreciate many things. If they hadn't  moved here, our lives would have never been the same.

I wouldn't have had the chance to study in Singapore. I wouldn't have had the chance to travel, or have the financial means to buy what we like, some luxuries like a car and travelling (although, our family is still pretty frugal in our daily expenses other than paying for our car, a  bigger flat that we later moved into, me and siblings school fees). 

To quote malaysia as an example. Living expenses are ridiculously expensive. You need a car to move around(public transport is way underdeveloped), pay for road tax, exorbitant toll fees. Food is really expensive, where your typical cai png is RM 7 easily (differs from state but assuming Johor or Selangor). I swear working part time in Singapore pays better than Malaysia, and purchasing power in Singapore is way higher than Malaysia level. If my parents had stayed in Malaysia, our standard of living would have been much, much lower.

What made me even more thankful is what has caused an outrage in Malaysia. The matriculation program. Where 90% of the public university placing are reserved for Bumipiteras with the remaining 10% allocated to non-Bumi (aka the Chinese and Indian). The reason given by our education minister is that Bumis are not on equal footing because they are poorer, can't speak Chinese so they are discriminated in finding a job, and that non Bumis are richer and can afford private university education (much more expensive than public university which can cost up to 8 to 10 times more). What's worse is that even university chancellors are approving this view. (Which is weird, because if that's the case, the program should allocate placing based on financial background instead of race, which they have now associated with financial background)

This program lets Bumi students with poorer grades into public university. There are stories of Chinese and Indian students who score 9As, with poor family background that makes them unable to afford public university education, but still rejected from the matriculation program (hence denying them admission to public uni which is cheaper). Just today, I read the news of a Chinese student with 9As, but rejected from admission while his peers who scored worse than him were accepted

My cousin is lucky. Her family made lots of money in business to be able to afford education in public uni. However she's so brilliant and scored really good and won the admission to University of Malaya, the most prestigious university of Malaysia. With now she has good grades and a leadership position.

I thought, if I had stayed in Malaysia, I wouldn't have been so lucky to enter a public university because my academics are only average with my co-curricular side being really poor.

As I grieve on all the injustice and hardships in Malaysia, I became even more grateful on what I had received in Singapore.

Have a good day :)"

63607,"I've applied for several jobs at careers.gov somewhere in march, but still haven't got any replies and the status on the portal still states ""In progress"".

63606,"#63606: a rather odd advice from numerous studies, anecdotes, and personal experience for couples who can engage in sexual intercourse to keep the relationship stable is this: put sex on a schedule. Like, we'll do it on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and then you stick to the schedule. That's just a suggestion but the idea is try and start with as often as the one with the higher libido wants, then taper down. Very often the partner who want less will adapt. It doesn't matter that on the scheduled day neither of you are ""in the mood"", just do it.

The idea is simple. Sex creates a hormonal reaction. Sex over a stable schedule keeps the hormone stable. Sex on a varied frequency wrecks the hormonal stability and it will cause mood swings and conflicts. No sex altogether in that case is actually better than intermittent sex. I used to date this girl and we had frequent sex, then after a fight, we stopped and decided to continue dating without sex, holding it off until at least after marriage. We fought more frequently afterwards and eventually breaking it off.

Afterwards I date my now-wife. One of the key to our dating life was that we decided very early on the boundary and schedule of our sexual activity. It was much smoother. After marriage and a stream of stable sex, I kinda mellow out and becomes much more sensible and sensitive. I caught myself crying to emotional movies I used to kinda snickered at when I was younger (I know Code Geass R2 was kinda stupidly written but why do I keep crying?). I became much less of an asshole than I was.

Then I also understand why young girls seems to prefer older married men over their single peers. Married men, just by the fact that they are generally satisfied sexually, are calmer, more sensitive, relaxed, and confident. They are also not desperately trying to get into a girl’s pants as soon as possible.  That’s more attractive.

In short, if you can communicate and negotiate a schedule to your sex while not totally preclude the “spur of the moments” that you both want, then it will solve most of the problem. This is the PG version of my advice, I have other R-rated advices that might get filtered here. If you want to hear it, drop an email at adam.wong.aw.126227@gmail.com"
63605,How did the stereotype that book smart people aren't street smart come about? The first class hons students I know are just as street smart as they are book smart while the non-book smart students I know are mediocre in terms of street smart as well...it's like the rich but unhappy vs poor but happy nonsense. People assume that one can't have it all. That's pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
63604,I have been trying my best at finding a girlfriend for a number of years. I tried getting girls out for meals etc. But most of the girls whom I like are usually attached. The girls who are single either have somebody they like already or are often girls whom guys would often shun. Any advice?
63602,"I need some genuine romantic advice. After I broke up with my ex, it has been almost a year since I went out on a date and I've become somewhat socially awkward that I can barely hold a conversation with a girl (text exchanges barely lasts 1 week, 2 weeks max). 

Part of me believes in letting fate decide but at the same time, I can't help but feel lonely / feel that I might never find the one again. 

So my question is, should I continue working on myself (doing things that make me happy/life more fulfilling) or try to spend some time in finding the one (asking girls out on dates etc.)? Will girls actually actively go for guys that are doing generally well in life (good job, excel in studies, win competitions, etc.)?"
