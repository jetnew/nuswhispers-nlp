53393,"There is this guy that i used to like, probably still do but i dont really know anymore. What's the relationship between us you might ask, its just plain ambiguous. One moment we can look like we're head over heels for each other even the people around us would think that we're totally into each other, another moment we can be like total strangers, not talking and stuff. His friends told me before that he really liked me but i have never ever heard it from himself so it really makes me wonder if he really likes me. We would talk to each other almost every single day(provided one of us is willing to initiate a convo) but i honestly cant tell if he likes me or not.. perhaps its just me?? He would go around showing me pictures of celebrities who he thinks are pretty and sometimes i feel like i'm not his type at all?? And every time i'd see him liking other girls' stuff on facebook and instagram but he rarely even likes the stuff i post.. but then again he'd make a lot of comments about it in our private chat like how sometimes he thinks the shorts im wearing are too short or how blur i look in someone else's photo and stuff.. He has never ever said that i'm pretty nor has he ever praised me before.. All he does is just tease me saying that im fat and short and resembles a pig (in a jokingly matter, ofcourse but sometimes it makes me abit sad) He'd talk about the pretty girl he met in the library or just point out pretty girls he spot around the campus everytime we're together.. We have never ever made it clear what exactly is our relationship but i have always been treating him like a best friend because I'm afraid that confessing my feelings would just end up ruining the friendship as I'm not sure about how he feels about me. I have tried hinting him to make clear our relationship but he the things he does everyday just makes me more and more confused.. he'd get jealous when a guy comes too close to me and even get mad at people who tried to hit on me just because they're lonely but best friends does this to each other too dont they???? Some days he'd use some random pickup lines on me and then proceeding to tell me he's just testing out on me so he can enhance his skill and pick up girls for real like seriously ????? I've been told by a few people that i look like a certain hong kong drama actress and recently he's been telling me he's very into that certain actress like idk if he's trying to imply things or am i just overthinking??? Guys pls gimme some advice on what should i do.. TT I'd wish that i can confess but i seriously dont want to risk our friendship considering its been so long since we knew each other (3 years) and its so hard to imagine life without him if things ever goes wrong.. what should i do? :( "

You shouldn't feel pressured into sex at all. If you've stated clearly to your boyfriend that you don't want sex, then he shouldn't keep pressuring you into it. Consent without being pressured is important. Dump him"

53389,"Hi I would really appreciate an advice for my life right now.
Every since ord my physical fitness have been deteriorating. During the summer holiday, I have trained and went for an ippt test before school starts but unfortunately, I failed. I haven't been able to cope with my studies lately and my labs and tutorials are dispersed throughout the day with awkward hours in between, this makes training and scheduling ipt very difficult.

My ippt window closes in less than 2 weeks and it is impossible for me to pass since I haven't been able to train the past 2 months. With this burden adding to my academic stress, I might be going behind bars as a uni student because I am simply useless to the defence of singapore. 

Does anyone know what educational materials are allowed in prison so that I can be productive there and not lose out on my uni studies?"
53388,"Just a rant here after reading an assortment of posts and misogynistic comments. Apologies for the length (pun intended). 

Honestly, your dick size should not generally have that much influence on how much love and affection your girl has for you (anomalies do apply of course). 

What matters from what what i’ve Observed, at least on the sex perspective, is how you treat your girl.  Do you love and respect her? Do you reciprocate? As cliched as this sounds, and it probably does, are you a good partner? Do you try to be that guy whom she feels safe, cherished and happy with? Are you the understanding and supportive partner who encourages her to partake in activities like a part-time job, even though it might potentially result in less time for the both of you, because you KNOW it’s for her own good? Or are you that asshole who insists on gratification at the expense of her discomfort? Are you that selfish partner who lies in bed, expecting to be pleasured and then assume that she’d be alright with settling herself? Are you that jerk who insists on sex every time, be it via guilt tripping, pleading or forcing, you must have your girl pleasure you, even when she’s uncomfortable, like if she’s on her period? 

Some of my buddies hate giving oral but love receiving it. Where’s the fairness in that? They claim it’s disgusting; it’s tiring...to hell with All that. Your girl puts up with the same shit by sucking and licking yours, is it too much to ask to reciprocate? Worse still for those who force their partners to do certain things; let insisting to cum in their mouth. Don’t get me wrong, it feels awesome and it’s so satisfying, some times it’s even better than sex. If they like it, good for you! But if they don’t, WTF do you still insist? 

It might sound like it doesn’t matter, but a little consideration and care goes a long way. I love my girlfriend, and even at the expense of being teased by my mates that i’m whipped or that I can afford to be more demanding, i’d still stick with what I do now. I’m happy that she’s happy, i’m glad that she enjoys sex as much as I do. Be that partner she deserves; be that partner she’s proud of. If you can’t respect that, then it doesn’t matter what size dick you have, you’ll always be that shit partner who’s not only bad in the sack, but also a terrible, jerk-ass boyfriend. Don’t blame her for dumping your ass, blame yourself for being one.

53385,"I am an alumni who has graduated sometime within the last decade (keeping it ambiguous). Didn't do well at all, even failed a core module during my first year, but somehow I graduated with a less-than-average CAP. Somehow I was offered a job (even though it was a couple of months after almost everyone), and somehow I am still working in the same profession as what I did. For that I ought to count myself lucky.

Fast forward (x years later) to recently, I was considering options to do postgraduate [coursework] studies (open to both local and overseas) either next year or the year after, and unfortunately quite a good number of postgraduate courses from the overseas universities strongly suggest that I require a good CAP (which I obviously don't), and a submission of (usually a minimum of) 3 letters of recommendation, (most if not all) from professors/academia. I seriously doubt any of the professors even remembered that I took their module(s) several semesters ago, and I don't expect them to. These two requirements really make me feel like I regret not making the best to do better or make smarter decisions back then, even though I had always made myself think that I don't regret the things I did (and only regretted the ones that I never got the chance to).

I am envious at my fellow classmates that went further and have the greener grasses now. The chances of me ever following the footsteps, even if I were to give myself a few more years, seem bleak now...

Often, the little things (doing tutorials, paying attention in class, proofreading your reports, double check your project against the requirements) count too.

53365,"#53302 Will focus on other aspects instead of elaborating on the benefits of helping fellow peers in my 4 years. In fact, I think I have received much more than giving. I think it is normal to feel that way in your first semester, but it is unwarranted concern.

-Helping a few peers is not gonna tilt the bell curve against you. For a bell curve subject, there is at least 50-400 students. The most no. of students I have helped in a subject, I estimated it to be  15, and the help I would be able to provide for some is very minimal ie your help hardly pushed up the bell curve. If you were to realise you will be competing against non NUS students in the future, your impact on shifting the bell curve is 0. 

- You don't have to be a saint and help everyone. Help your friends, help friendly classmates, and avoid the snakes, so you won't feel used. 

-If you are afraid of helping people in a sheltered environment, you will definitely not be willing to help others when you are working. It depends on what kind of person you are ok to be. Personally I am not comfortable living like a hedgedog even though I know there are many snakes in the forest."

I broke up with you because you were just as unaccommodating. I accommodated you, went over to your workplace on the other side of Singapore, went to school on holidays to see you because you were ""busy"", went over to your place a fair amount of times, only for you to continue working and ignore me in all of the times I listed above.

I know your design degree is tough. I know your workload is heavy. I didn't complain because I knew you were working hard for your submission. When you graduated last year, I was truly happy for you. I wanted to bring you out for dinner after commencement, but what did you say? You told me that you wanted to go out with your friends. So I relented, it's going to be the last time in a while you'll see them. But for the entire month afterward, you didn't want to meet. You wanted me to come over because you were ""tired"". You were at home, your insta story shows you cleaning your fish bowl and you tell me you're tired? After you started working, it was impossible to get a hold of you at all. You were always at the office, on weekends too. My friends in your firm tell me your schedule is nowhere near as hectic as you make it out to be. You tell me inspections last till 6pm? My friends' instastories show you and them knocking off at 3pm. You wanted to know how I know? Now you do.

I work part-time. I can't leave work until 1, and your house is on the other end of the purple line to my workplace and my house. You never want me to stay for dinner. I've never met your mother, or your father in the one and a half years we were together. And the one time I came over after work, I arrived at 3, and you chased me out before 4 because we were done having sex. I'm your girlfriend, not a call girl. That entire incident made me think you're just with me for the sex. And you ask why I don't initiate sex?

Despite all these things, you never once gave me any help. My parents are strongly religious, and you are a ""free thinker"". When you come over, you don't talk to them, and you keep quiet when they try to talk to you. Think for me, I begged you, don't put me in a spot. But you told me that ""I am the way I am, your parents are just going to have to accept it"". So I stopped inviting you over. 

I got angry at you choosing to show up at our date half an hour late, without any warning. I got angry at you ignoring my texts and calls. I got angry at you happily texting another girl while I was talking to you and you didn't pay ANY attention to me for the whole date. Are all of these things ""small things"" to you? You complain and guilt trip me when I text my male friends, but somehow because it's you, you can text members of the opposite sex just fine?

I'm needy for meeting once a week? You never want to do anything, and if we go over to your place, you'll just be playing your games, after you ask me for sex and I decline. Of course I'll ask you to go somewhere else, if not you'll just spend your time ignoring me.

You complain to me about everything and I lend a listening ear, but you won't listen to my problems, telling me that ""it's nothing la"" and ""like that only?"". I open up to you and you dismiss my concerns? You'd rather watch your videos than listen to me talk? How disrespectful can you get?

I've raised breaking up with you many times. This breakup was a long time coming. Each time I chose to give you another chance, but you didn't make good on it. My friends told me that you were egotistical and selfish, and that's why they told me to break up with you. I guess they were right. Why the hell would you want to be introduced to them anyway? You think all my friends are ""rabak"" anyway.

This new guy? I got together with him a couple months later, not a week. Don't exaggerate like you always do. He's patient, unlike you, and he tries to work things through. He's not religious, but he tries to show respect. He talks to me. He accommodates me, and so I am more than willing to repay the favour. He's everything you never were.

I'm very happy with him. I hope you find happiness too.

Yours Sincerely,
M.

Admins, please at least allow me to clear my name."
53349,"To OP of #53336,

Here are some free advice for you: I just broke up with someone, who has a very similar view of the world like you. Blame blame blame blame and blame again. Because it is easier to choose to blame someone else. Somehow everything about the relationship has to be about your own needs first, putting your own face, your own wounds, your own idea of how the relationship should be like first. 

I'm sorry to break news to you, that the world does not revolve around you. Well, at least not your ex-girlfriend. She doesn't owe you ANYTHING for her decisions. Even for things that you think you have done for her or for the relationship, please take some accountability and claim those 'things' as YOUR OWN DECISIONS. You can choose to love someone, but you cannot blame her if it doesn't work out. It's not her fault. Sometimes she is not just the right person for you, and you have to accept that. 

Have you ever taken a serious look at your past relationships?  Why did they fail? What did you do? What did you say? How many times during an arguement, that you sincerely took responsibility for what you said or did, and held yourself accountable for it? You can play the victim card, but nobody is going to pity you. Because we all see through your lies. Well, at least I'm referring to myself, who is a stranger online who doesn't even know you. And the other people commenting on that post.

From your confession, it seems like you haven't been able to move on yet. I can empathise with you on that, but i can only offer advice here. Which is to re-evaluate your priorities in life. What do you want to do in your life? What is important to you? How do you plan to get there? How important was your girlfriend to you, and how was she supporting you towards your dreams? If she isn't as great as you hoped to be, then let's just use this to cut her off completely. Stop looking at her social media accounts and let yourself​ go. Because you deserve someone who can support you and your dreams.

Hope you are able to recover well and take care."

Jia you and pull it through!

P.S not a medical student, but research about their life enough and aspire to be one in the future :')

53303,"hi guys, i am here to seek advice because i am really confused and i am not sure what should i do...

so there's this guy that i really really like in jc. i am almost damn sure that he likes me back as well. but neither of us made a move so its kind of just left hanging... it has been like 6 years. i did try to hint at him on valentines day two years ago, however i chickened out at the last moment and didn't get what i wanted to say out. not sure if he realized it at all... but i mean if some girl purposely ask a guy to meet on vday and give him chocolates it can't just be friendship chocolates right.... but he didn't respond or anything

moving on, i am starting to fall for someone else but it is because he reminded me so much of my crush. i think that he is a really nice guy and i might have a chance with him? but there's this voice at the back of my head telling me that this is not right because he seems like just a replacement and it is really wrong. i know i sound really ridiculous but the worst part is crush is still single until now despite 4 years of uni makes me feel like what if he is waiting for me? but i know from what i have described it sounds like he doesn't like me at all. why am i still harboring such hope, i really don't know. it is just a strong gut feeling. but if the gut feeling turns out to be wrong. maybe he is gay? or may be he likes someone in uni but he doesn't dare to make a move? i feel like i am wasting so much opportunities in life when i could be meeting or even dating better men. i just wish i could move on.

53302,"#53302 Will focus on other aspects instead of elaborating on the benefits of helping fellow peers in my 4 years. In fact, I think I have received much more than giving. I think it is normal to feel that way in your first semester, but it is unwarranted concern.

-Helping a few peers is not gonna tilt the bell curve against you. For a bell curve subject, there is at least 50-400 students. The most no. of students I have helped in a subject, I estimated it to be  15, and the help I would be able to provide for some is very minimal ie your help hardly pushed up the bell curve. If you were to realise you will be competing against non NUS students in the future, your impact on shifting the bell curve is 0. 

- You don't have to be a saint and help everyone. Help your friends, help friendly classmates, and avoid the snakes, so you won't feel used. 

-If you are afraid of helping people in a sheltered environment, you will definitely not be willing to help others when you are working. It depends on what kind of person you are ok to be. Personally I am not comfortable living like a hedgedog even though I know there are many snakes in the forest."
