53198,Are my friends considered friends if they do nothing but to watch you drown in school?
53197,"There are a lot of fakers around nus. :(

When they thought I have a cap lower than them, they don't wish to be associated with me during group projects. Well, I admit I have that blur blur look and I always formed groups with the other loners (nothing wrong about that too, I am a loner too).

When they realize I have been maintaining my cap above 4, while they were hovering around 3.5; they became my 'friends' and became friendly. Look, I am not saying that a cap above 4 is very good or what... I also realized that I am not even one of the smartest kids in class. 

And then they realize that I am just an someone that kept to himself and preferred to study on my own; they gossiped about 'how selfish I am'. 

I am not even your tutor or anything; we go to the same class and have the same notes, it all come down to the effort put in. It's not like I have any 'tips or cheat codes'. Nowadays, when I walked past them; once again, I became 'air' to them again. Good riddance, bunch of fakers!!!

53196,"I'm a computing grad and I regret having selected modules to try and be an 'all-rounder'. The thing is, the industry still only wants either hardcore coders or good business people. They don't need a good salesperson who understands how computing systems work. They just want you to sell. They don't need a hardcore coder to know how to sell, they just need you to code.

We'll always be stuck with non-technical salespeople overselling and coders grumbling thereafter because of this. The jack-of-all-trades is an unappreciated unicorn. "

53189,"RVRC updates:
In this post, I would like to thank Master Kunle for taking time to chair the dialogue to resolve the recent disciplinary issues, and the answers were really satisfactory and reasonable. There were satisfactory solutions given out to resolve the situation, including my case. I hope to see RVRC turn for the better after this round.

I believe that RVRC may have rooms for improvement, and i am really glad that changes are made to make our voices heard. If there is one thing i want to highlight that makes RVRC special, it will be the leadership- that makes it have so much potential to develop. 

Tbh I am thankful to be in rvrc. I have met many great friends here. And like a community that made me feel like a family. Had my fun share of laughter here and tbh the ""chill culture"" along Those insane ameen supper, those L4D games, those HTHT chill over pool session, and KTV! It is this strong support network and unity culture that keeps us going. 

No propaganda- Just my own heartfelt words.. But honestly, glad that everything is finally over~ finally i can focus on my midterms today"

53176,"Judging from #53149, especially the part which mentioned how Mr Cat lover lash out at society, women and the authorities, incel sounds like a good word to  describe this fella. Strange that he seems so bitter about rejection from girls, isn't it? "

53174,"OP here in response to #53084
Thank you all for your kind words of support. I honestly didn't expect such a huge response from the community here :')

Yes, I am clinging to my cloak of anonymity, and I have upped by cyber-security across all my social media platforms. I will NOT pm anyone via any platform, even if they claim to be forming a ""support group"". (once bitten twice shy, also as mentioned before, the strength to overcome trauma comes from within)

For those who know he-who-shall-not-be-named, I kindly request that you guys don't harass or intentionally try to dig him out. I do not want him to retaliate either physically in person or online behind a screen. Also, let's not stoop down to his level of harassing people online. 

""How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours.""
- Wayne Dyer

I choose to react in a calm collected manner, and not let my anger and frustrations regarding this incident cloud my judgement.

I sincerely hope justice will be meted out, but in the right way - by the school or relevant authorities, and not by publicly shaming him online. 

Whether it be a harsh punishment, or a committed effort to seek treatment to help said party address some underlying issues he may have, I hope that at the end of this ordeal we can all move forward to lead a better life.

To #53149, thank you for informing me of the details and coming out to share your story. I am mentally prepared for both outcomes (having justice served or seeing him walk away scott free). I can only hope for the best and prepare for the worst. 

To all who read this, thank you for your support. I hope all ladies out there are more vigilant. I hope no one falls prey to him ever again.

it took me awhile to snap out of it.

i guess the stress is getting to me pretty badly. "
53172,"All these foreveralone posts here sometimes make me wonder, why not create some kind of 'singles group' for NUS students? Maybe not a CCA. Maybe it can just be a simple telegram group or something. I mean, it'd be a little shameful but can be really helpful in getting people together (and helping SG's low birth rate, rite).
Why don't someone do it?"

53168,#53151  actually if you look very very closely at the definition of makeup you will realise it is about deception and playing with the ways one’s mind works . Add to that the various clothes that are designed to give the illusion of a certain shape like leggings that go all the way to the waist or accessories like neutral glasses that make your eyes look bigger and it’s hard to believe you are doing it out of some great philosophical love for aesthetics. That’s why when one comes across a woman who has minimal makeup or is without it it’s admirable. If you are so irritated with men’s attitude why don’t  you look into why so many girls feel so insecure and what role do cosmetic companies and social media websites play in fostering it?

Of course, he didn’t want to deny he was just playing with my feelings and leading me on all along. What happened between us felt like the joke was on me.. "

53157,"Amidst the discussion on the so-called 'Mr Cat Lover' preying on cat feeders, may I remind the community to keep your righteous indignation and vigilantism for harassers (or rather THE harasser in this case), and not cat feeders in UTown in general. 

Our volunteer cat feeders, both guys and girls, take care of the resident cats at UTown and you may have seen us doing the rounds with our containers of cat food. Most of us do not claim to be 'cat lovers', but we search for and attend to the campus cats every day with our own time and at our own expense, so action speaks louder than words. I am sure that most of us, and certainly myself, would be happy to speak to genuine enquirers about the volunteer feeder programme and what we do, but that does not mean we are even remotely interested in hitting on you. We are ordinary members of the student community and we have our own significant others - even fiances in some cases - and of course we have our own studies to attend to.

So please do not tar the feeder community with the same brush due to the actions of one individual who, as far as I know, is not even part of the volunteer feeders. Feel free to say hello or to chat with us regarding the campus cats - you can keep a safe distance if you wish, being cat people, we're used to dealing with skittishness! And most importantly, please be kind to the campus cats! "

I have.

Funny thing was, the breakup was mutual. We both knew we'd be better off without each other, with someone else. It was a peaceful one, one where both of us finally accepted the fact in silence. I thought we could remain as distant friends after that, but somehow he acted really coldly and rather rude towards me. At that point in time, I was just taken aback but just shrugged it off; I mean if he doesn't want to be friends, what else could I do, right?

What's even funnier was that I actually still felt really thankful for the relationship even after we broke up. I mean, it wasn't all that good, but we had our good times. I tried really hard to solve the problems we had, and so did he. Just because we failed to keep our relationship didn't mean that it wasn't valid for the past few years. 

The funniest of all is that he actually started to talk shit about me in front of our friends, and his family. The thing is, none of them are even true, he twisted the truth such it was unrecognisable from the original events that happened, just to paint me in a bad light and make people think that I was the crazy one. Like, I never ever expected these actions to come from him. Maybe there were things I didn't know about him, perhaps I did not understand him that well, but this is about one's moral character, which is something I 100% trusted he had. 

Boy am I glad that I ran far away from someone like that. It's so scary how someone can just change 180 degrees suddenly. "

53108,"#53085: couples, especially married couples don't drift apart because of a single cause. It's more likely to be one thing on top of another that build up over time. The only way to stop this is for one of the two to immediately realise it very early on and fix it. If it has gone on for that long, one side start finding sex elsewhere, and the other side despite knowing it, ignore and/or find fun of their own, then probably only a real miracle will reverse it. If your father was the sole breadwinner, then it makes it impossible for your mother to divorce him. A divorce would end up costing your father more (in terms of alimony and suddenly without a woman to do all the cookings and chores [you can hire people to do that but it cost a lot]), so the current arrangement works for both of them, in a rather twisted way.

Think about kicking him out for a moment: can you support yourself and your mother financially? Probably not. Does he love you? What happiness can you bring him? Most parents love their child unconditionally, especially so if the children make their parents proud. A whiny child draws irks from the parents. Unhappily married parents don't like their children very much (since the child has the hated person's blood)."
