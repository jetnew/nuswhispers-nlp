 There is this continuous CCA planning and executing issues which involves non corporative chairperson and members. I don’t understand why do they claim to be willing to serve and volunteer when they always MIA throwing shit for me to do. Worst of all, when I plan finish the work, they change my plan! Then why on earth you tell me to do the planning in the first place? Everyone are busy, if you have so much time to change why don’t you just join in the planning phrase together? Moreover stop saying you are loaded with things.  Everyone is loaded with stuff, can’t you yourself be a role leader before condemning the rest of the members? You yourself could not be a good example what do you expect the rest to do? 

And  Individual FYP project is really non humane work. One person to tank everything? Conducting of experiments etc all by myself? There is still a strict timeline to follow? I started to question why did I have to do this just to get my Honors? It’s too stressful......I feel alone abandoned with tons of nonsense.

These days I realise that the favourite thing to do is to sleep. I really hope that I can sleep forever and never be awake to face these......"

53283,"I am one of the members of IFG committee this year. I joined the team wanting to help IFG improve its reputation, and create bonds among the different faculties. However, going through the whole process this year, I felt that there are alot of things that the overall committee involved in IFG that can work upon.

Firstly, I do not think it is wise to use the ""backdoor"" approach to get people into committee, as you end up forming cliques and make others in your committee feel left out beyond the superficial fact of just being in a committee. What happen to openess and inclusivity?

Next, why is it necessary for Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson to be in every chat that exist anyway? Isnt the hierarchical structure already there to ensure work is done efficiently? Why must we allocate Sports Club MC to be the PD of different cells anyway? Capability to match up the role cannot be purely by who is in MC and who is not what!

Lastly, why is the structure of comm so segregated, almost like there is little interaction among the different comm. I mean we are one committee, would it not be necessary to know each other more to work better together? We all joined IFG for a reason, why the separation anyway?

Sports Club, while I respect your dedication and hard work, please make some good changes and work on all these problems or a lot of others will suffer unnecessarily for it"

I think you have less a case that ""I hope he/she will be OK"" and more ""I hope he/she will not become a psycho and murder my ass"". Just bite the bullet and put your faith in chance.

53278,"I was struck by how many people relish loading their speech with the word “like”. I Googled about the phenomenon and found this on Quora:

Q: Why do people use the word ""like"" as a filler word? How did it spread so quickly when it makes us sound so unintelligent?

A: Because, like, you can put it, like, pretty much, like, anywhere, and it like, makes you seem, like, casual. (Actually not quite everywhere.) It's also a hesitation word (like um), and functions as a sort of, like, disclaimer that you're uncertain about your choice of words.

A clever answer. I hope practitioners, professional or unconscious amateur, of this manner of speech will seriously reflect on what they have been doing to themselves and their listeners. Are there books, sacred manuals or empirical studies that suggest this way of speaking -- using “like” so indiscriminately -- “sounds so unintelligent”, as the Quora user puts it? I don’t think any serious academic could say anything about intelligence in this context, but otherwise, under two approaches to language: the prescriptive and proscriptive, the (slightly exaggerated but telling) passage you have read above definitely reminds me of a spreading linguistic malady.

Prescriptivist is defined as “believing that there are correct and wrong ways to use language and that books about language should give rules to follow, rather than describing how language is really used.” It is a position, as far as I know, that few outside the English language department of schools would voluntarily advocate. Most people are “nonchalants” with descriptivist (the opposite of prescriptivist) inclinations, people who simply don’t care or believe that we should all embrace language as it is really used, rather than giving rules to follow saying what is correct and not correct. 

When you hear people using bad speech (to the extent you believe it matters), and yet don’t want to inform them outright, what is the recourse? The proscriptivist -- someone who tries to restrict or forbid -- can help. As a soft proscriptivist (I try not to forbid), let me lay out some reasonable positions on the word “like”: 

▮ I’m for the restriction of the word “like” used in speech as an excuse to not think or carefully select words to advance a point or argument clearly and accurately. 
▮ I’m for the restriction of the word “like” used to make a factual claim that should be conveyed with minimum ambiguity, or used in an attempt to equate one’s subjective feelings with objective facts. 
▮ I’m for the moderate use of filler words such as “like” (and “Um/er/uh”, “actually/basically/seriously”, “I guess/I suppose/ I feel” as well) especially in a time-constrained conversation or discussion where participants aim to learn as much as possible, because the use of such words or phrases necessarily dilutes and reduces the weight of every sentence and consequently entire speeches. 

The reasons for my position are self-evident. “Like” is becoming an absolute cliche, both as a word and chime. The novelist Martin Amis reminds us about “clichés of the mind and clichés of the heart”: when we slump into “herd-words and herd-phrases,” those “rhymes, chimes, repetitions, obscurities, dishonesties, vaguenesses” that come so easily to mind, we abdicate our responsibility to the hard work of original thinking, and abandon our claim to original thought. Clichés are the path to prejudice and intolerance, to ignorance and indoctrination.”

I urge everyone to approach the rampant user of “like” not with a summons or traffic ticket but with a wary eye for the imminent crash -- of a potentially refreshing and intellectually rewarding conversation. Do not follow their manner of speech because their style seems vogue and cool, or conveys a casualness that you admire. If there is a casual coolness or niftiness about him or her, it is definitely not because he has proven capable of wielding the word “like” as a weapon of cliché but something else. Look out for qualities of freshness and energy and emulate those instead. By adopting good speech and habits of mind ourselves, we restrict the space for bad ones.

53274,I have a really hard time opening up to people due to past experiences. either people have just used me or left me after opening up. it's was initially quite difficult to do so because by nature I'm a reserved person. but after all these experiences it just fells even more difficult. this has really affected making new friendship or getting to know someone at a deeper level because I'm unwilling to open up. has anybody felt like this before and what did yall do to improve it?

One or two photos are fine. But why an entire album with description of where we go and what we do? I feel that this is something that only TWO of us should keep memories about. Having more people knowing, is just awkward. Why is she so insecure and thinking that I'll cheat on her?"

Worst of all... When you are too sentimental to cut them out of your life... And you being to wonder if there are other things to cut to feel better...

It is SO SO much better to be single than to be in a relationship with a toxic person. Even though there are a few things you miss out by being single, the benefits enjoyed being single still vastly overwhelms the pain and trauma and drama a toxic gf or bf brings to u on a daily or hourly basis. Trust me to stay single and wait for the right person who is a match for u rather than to jump into a relationship quickly and make your life a living nightmare if you happen to catch the wrong kind of fish.

Not many fresh graduates are accepted into this department. Not all colleagues have been nicest with their words while teaching me. There is one colleague in particular, whose words have stressed me mentally and try to avoid. Although I very much like to learn, but it is tiring to fight a mental battle of staying there if there are team members who feel I am not an asset. The truth is, I also feel I lack in fundamentals.
