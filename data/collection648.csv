64899,"A response to #64811
So many girls are hurt over #64811 because they're those people lmaooo :')
Instead of pointing out whats wrong about his opinion on sg girls yall just triggered and meme-responding
I lived in sg until I was 11, went to the states and finished high school before coming back to serve NS. Honestly, having lived in another country for 7 years, I can say that there is merit to what he's saying with regard to the interactions and reactions you get when starting a conversation with a local girl. Although the examples given by OP generalised scenarios that lean toward the extreme, there are plenty of instances where a subdued versions widely occur. I.e. girls thinking that they are an object of interest when they aren't. Maybe most of you can't contrast the typical local girl with another who lives abroad so there's no comparison to be drawn, but ask anyone who has lived in a foreign country to tell you the difference. In general, local girls do give themselves more credit when it's due when it comes to their self-image in a bid to seem more desirable."
64897,"Isit normal  in the workin g world, customer can treat you like shit when they dissatistfied, scold and shout at you on yr face, but later on when they realise they need you to finish things for them, the client can suddenl turn sweet and chasing you in demanding yet ""fakely polite"" way, eg. ""Kindly do this for me""?

 Im facing the same thing and was wondering how client think  once they change their own personality?"
64894,What’re the SP (secret partner) activities like in both ntu/ nus? (what do you do etc) the more experience/ opinions the better :)
64891,"Hello a freshie here! Just want to ask what are the chances of appealing into a hall?(and which hall to appeal to) I really wish to stay in one but I couldn’t make it for the exposure camp and don’t know anyone to lobang:( 

thank you in advance!
(I’m still gonna try appealing no matter what ^^)"
64890,Anyone here doing a masters in SoC? How is it like? Do you find the coursework challenging
64889,Can the air con in YIH student lounge be f**king fixed? It's bloody unbelievable that it's been down for so long. There are students that return to school during the summer break to use the lounge and the heat and stuffiness extremely unbearable.
64887,"I always wonder what do other girls honestly think about secret partner (SP) activity in orientation camps? Does anyone feel threatened by the activity? Is it even still appropriate given the past sexual/hazing incidents in previous years? I want to stress that I am not against guys. I have huge respect for guys, the vast majority of them are very respectful and understanding when it comes to gender issues."
64883,"I’m the OP of #64702. Two new issues here:
1) I actually spent $30,000 on her and our dates. I made a calculation error last time, $15,000 is when you average out between the 2 of us.
2) Her birthday is coming soon in early August. We always go on overseas trip together for that occasion. She wants to go to Europe this year. If we go this year, I expect to spend another $6000 between the two of us. I have to decide whether to book in a week or two.
Is there any way out of this? I’m still very hesitant to break up with my girlfriend."
64880,"Global warming is real. That’s why I think nus should implement air con free Monday from next semester onwards. We use so much air con from labs to libraries to tutorial rooms to some canteens. Think about this as earth day, we can implement a similar concept by having people switch off their air con every Monday. It will save a lot of electricity on the school as a whole. At the same time build up nus reputation as one of the institutions that is forward looking and creative in solving problems.

I also have another drastic but creative idea. We can consider doing this once a year during earth day. You see, temperatures at night are cooler than during the day. During earth day each year, class timings should be shifted 12 hours later, e.g. if you have a 8am class on earth day, you report at 8pm; if you have a 1pm class, your class for that day would be at 1am, 12 hours later. with everyone working at night when it is cooler for that day, we can reduce air con and electricity usage. it can send a very strong message that we are serious about reducing electricity consumption, and the publicity resulting from it can promote our reputation as a university in a good way."
64878,"I am a male student staying on campus here. I went for my ippt last Saturday, and I was very impressed by the safety measures taken by the saf. As usual, they have their supervising officer, conducting officer, and safety officer during the event. There was a medic, doctor, and safety rover standing by, with all the medical equipment in place should any emergency occur. They conduct safety briefings at the start of the event lasting 15 mins long. Someone almost fainted during the event due to dehydration, but thanks to the medical people on standby, it was quickly brought under control.

Comparing this to what happens during every evening on campus, I feel that there are insufficient safety measures in place for those of us who jog around nus on the pavements during the evening time. If somebody were to toh, that would be it. No medic, no doctor, no safety rover. If you think about it, you should be worried.

We should ban jogging around the campus immediately as a short term measure. Next, in the long term there should be a roster set up among the different halls/rc on campus. I.e to say each night, the hall/rc on duty should provide a supervising officer, conducting officer and safety officer. They should conduct a mass warm up and cool down sessions for those who wish to exercise i.e. to say jogging. They should also conduct a safety briefing before the start of each activity, similar to the army.

Next, we should enlist medical students and/or those with first aid background to provide medical cover. Maybe those males who were medics in the army previously should be enlisted to help as well. For every evening where there is jogging, there should be at least one first aider and one medical student (playing the role of doctor) on standby.

We should also get a volunteer with a car to act as the transport operator, in case any casualty needs evacuation to the nearest hospital, I.e. to say NUH. Maybe those males who were transport operators in the army previously can be enlisted to help also.

In summary, I propose to implement the safety measures every evening to facilitate people who wish to jog, I.e. to say have people fill these roles every evening: supervising officer, conducting officer, safety officer, medic (a.k.a first aider), doctor (a.k.a. medical student), transport operator (a.k.a. driver), and a car (playing the role of a safety rover). 

I believe we are smart enough to implement safety measures BRFORE s**t happens, and not the other way round I.e. to say only implementing safety measures AFTER s**t happens."
64875,"I joined NUS 4 years ago,now im graduating with just one friend still in contact. I am a loner for 4 years with no groups or whatsoever gang of friends. 

I once had few good friends and we are besties,  not until we enrol into different majors and I saw how they changed ---- giving me obvious signals like ""not mingling with you since I dont need you from different majors anymore""  two of us ended up intern at same place,  this friend of mine keep quiet on every info and only approach me for benefits.

Now we are graduated. Im lost and confused what are friends in my life?  Should i please my friends so that  i can have friends?"
64874,"Hi CS seniors and Prof. Ben, I wanted to know if it is possible to do one of the Software Engineering Project requirements here at SoC and one on exchange? Eg. if I do CS3216 here can I do a module at my PU that maps back to CS3217 later? [subject to availability of such a module ofcourse]. Just wanted to know if SoC allows such a split."
64872,"I am the alumni OP who of #64839 who commented on Singaporean vs foreign girls...

I like to make a few clarifications and acknowledgements since there have been questions on why I am writing this.

First off, I can assure you it’s not humblebrag. I have already said I am very lucky to be put in the position that I am. I worked very, very hard in school and throughout my career to have gotten the opportunities that I have had. Trust me, I could easily haolian if I wanted to... but what do I get for bragging online anonymously??

So why do I post? It’s because I have been in very similar shoes with many NUS guys. You’re decent looking, smart, tall but are unable to score? Yeap, I was in that position and not afraid to admit it. I had dates alright but the highest I managed was a 7/10 with makeup and she was obnoxious AF. The rest of the 6/10 girls always made me do all the chasing and constantly made me feel they were doing me a favor by “hanging out” with me. I didn’t want to put up with that so I doubled down hard on my academics, graduated near the top of My class and got a great job. Now? I don’t even look at 7/10 girls- I go for 8 and up minimally. I also shed off the mr nice guy I care about your gender studies course image, I just don’t care care and openly state I want girls who can cook and clean as well as they look. 

And it’s possible. One of the posters is correct in that language helps a lot. That’s very true from my experience too.

Btw, on the guy commenting on my take on china girls.. I am 100% sure you’re NOT dating or married to a looker. The lookers are the ones I am referring to, the rest are just invisible to me. why bother? You proud of bringing home an average china girl? 

Singaporean girls are getting out-competed left, right and center and they don’t even know it. Laughable."
64871,Has anyone taken CS3233 Competitive Programming and can input their opinions on it? I am interested but am not sure if I'm good enough for it.
64870,Can someone share the prospects of becoming a teacher? I’m graduating next AY with a degree in engineering and i’m considering to become a teacher but I feel like it’s a waste to not do anything related to engineering
64868,"How to know if a girl is interested in me?
So I met her during an overseas internship. It’s been about 2 months since summer started. Initially she was quite quiet & shy as we are in a group. However, I slowly managed to make her to be more out-going, etc. She now makes fun of me quite often (using the jokes I used on her for instance), asking me stuff, etc. There were a few touchy moments but during a normal talk during dinner, she said she’s not emotionally ready for a relationship. Yet, there is mixed signals I am receiving as she treats me differently as compared to the rest in the group. At the same time, she actually asked me whether I wanna know her cousin from the same school & was trying to matchmake me with other girls in the office in a joking manner. 
I do know that she is messaging a guy quite excessively & she actually wore a navy singlet during the trip here. Does that mean I’m gone case?"
64867,"Prof Ben, are IHL teaching job salary increments/bonuses fairly stable, even during recessions? I suppose recessions do affect the increments/bonuses but to a much lesser extent relative to other jobs?"
64865,"My friend told me she was diagnosed with a medical condition that makes her not only infertile as she was born without a womb, she has an underdeveloped vagina as well. This condition is very rare as it occurs only in 1 in 5000 female babies. Although there are treatment options available, they currently are not available in Singapore now and with her family background being poor, she may not be able to get the treatments as they are expensive. She is currently very depressed as she thinks that she will never be able to date or get married. She thinks that her boyfriend may eventually break up with her knowing her condition. How do I help her? I am also very curious if there will be guys who are nice enough to accept this condition as it would not be easy."
64864,"My bf and I have been dating for about six months and I have yet to meet any of his friends but I have met his family many times. Should I feel weird about not meeting any of his friends before?  He never mentioned introducing them to me before and he has met some of my friends. I previously didn’t notice this until my sister pointed out that it’s weird since most of the time, people would introduce their SO to their friends first then to their family. So, is it weird or not?"
64863,"I've a question for the ladies, guy here by the way. What sort of ""assurances"" does females seek in a relationship/ dating phase?

The girl and I were quite good friends, and after finally plucking up my courage, I asked her if she was interested to date. She did not give me a direct answer, but she said yes one week later. Prior to dating her, I've been single all the way and have never been in a relationship before. She was practically my first date (considering I'm already in my mid-twenties). After 2-3months, she broke it off citing that she didn't get the ""assurances"" from me. I reflected after and kind of realised that while our status changed, my actions were kind of still in the good friends stage.

I've totally no idea what went wrong and what sort of ""assurances"" females seek. Haalp."

64859,"Hello! I am not from NUS, but today (Sat) while traveling in Prague with my gf, we met a NUS 2nd Year (going 3rd year) Geography student. She is currently on NOC in Stockholm, Sweden and we met during a free walking tour. Well... it started pouring half way during the tour and since she didn’t have an umbrella, we offered her one of ours and I used my poncho instead. But here comes the thing... She kinda disappeared from the tour group (along with our umbrella) and was nowhere to be found. (she could have lost the way while we walk from point to point.) By the time we found out she wasn’t around, it was too late.
The chances of us getting back our umbrella is pretty slim, given that she is heading to Poland tmr, and back to Sweden on Monday. We will also be leaving Prague on Monday...
But just hoping that if someone happen to know her, can you direct her to us? We will hope to at least hear from her. Thank you."
64857,Anyone can recommend good barbers/ hair salons that offer fashionable but yet affordable haircuts for young guys?

64854,"Is it silly of me to want to remain as genuine friends with people whom I met through dating apps, who didn't put in effort to keep in contact after concluding that we cannot proceed further than friends? (For example, 1: chatted online for a long time but refuses to meet up, drifted apart. 2: went to pursue someone else, stopped chatting with me and drifted apart. 3: decided that after meet-up, not compatible, started to ghost.) I do comment on their social media posts to give advices on their questions and check in on them as how a friend would do. The reason why I do these? Because I feel that fundamentally they are still good people whom I would want to be friends with, just that they are more ""practical"" in the sense that they see no point in keeping contact since we can't be potential partners."
64849,"Recently, I heard from a friend (who is in Orbital) that Orbital participants have a better chance of getting selected for NOC among SoC students. Apparently, the lady in charge of NOC came down for a talk and told them that Orbital participants have a significant advantage compared to non-Orbital participants during the selection for NOC. 

Like many SoC students who did not fit into Orbital vacancies, I'm doing software development (android app) independently during the break. My app is technically more difficult compared to my friend's ""Apollo 11"" app (he's just clearing the min requirements). The difference is that I will not be getting any MCs, prizes or official recognition for my app.

I'm wondering why Orbital participation leads to a higher chance for getting selected for NOC? Does the selection committee look out for ""Orbital/Vostok/Apollo 11/ Gemini"" to determine if an applicant is legit? If that is true, what can a non-Orbital participant do to get an equal shot at NOC?"
64847,Are people gonna judge me in uni if almost all my shirts are pink? I’m a girl
64846,"To 64833, you are not the only one. I feel like I'm dating a kid whenever this happens as my girlfriend also has this problem, she procrastinates to the core. As she is still a student, I've told her to change her regular spotify premium to a student package since last year but she hasn't when she can save half the price. Not sure if other girls are like this, she doesn't clean her room regularly too, hence her makeup/study table are dusty and messy, dustbin is always full of tissue paper etc. Even the digital clock by her bed has been out of battery since last year and she doesn't bother changing it. Oh, she also doesn't exercise as she thinks she isn't fat (yes she isn't, but it's unhealthy. She knows it but just can't help it.) 

I guess for people like this, it's pointless for you to nag continuously. They will only do things when they feel the urgency to complete it. Like how my girlfriend always studies last minute. But when she is determined to complete those tasks, she will take them very seriously. Take cleaning her room for an example, she will diligently clean every corner of her room till it's sparkling clean. So, don't force them. They will just get irritated and complete those tasks unwillingly.

I felt it was okay to take turns to pay, in fact it should be the right thing to do in a relationship. But for meals and between married couples... Is it just me who feel that it is very calculative? What's more they don't even have children now...

I think he's a nice guy, but I could say the same about other guys at the office. His appearance isn't my type at all either, other than his height.

64808,"@Prof Ben Leong (reply to #64785) I find that an AI club can cater to both competitive AI programmers and people who wish to explore AI further in depth. Given that there are many papers established on a day to day basis on new AI advancements (e.g we recently have papers mentioning about Generative Adversarial Networks / Efficientnets / Maximising accuracy training only using one epoch), it is impossible to cover each of them on a daily basis, having a club would allow for information sharing and also creating models which are way more accurate than if you were to do it alone. Also, given that AI is a very hot topic in recent years, there are certainly a lot of people seeking to explore AI further in depth.
Also, may i know why the right question to ask would be ""Why do we need a club for AI?"" As per my understanding, clubs like NUS Hackers / NUS Greyhats are set up because there are people interested in areas like hacking and cyber security. It'd certainly be great if you can explain why we need clubs for NUS Hackers / NUS Greyhats.

Never really liked this guy because he two timed her before they got together. Well she knows he was in a rs but willing got with him. She is not perfect but feelings still developed. Most recently she was with me when my family member died, at the hospital. I was devastated and exhausted but she stood by me. She was absent at the funeral though. Was upset but i got over that. Thing is, she is deeply religious and i am not a part of her religion. I know that for a fact even if we are friends we can never connect as well as her religious friends.
