52199,"There are two kinds of science students. 

First, you’ve the science students that are out of this world. Maybe they come from Mars, or some other dimension. They are extremely smart but unbeknownst to most people. These people are going to succeed over Albert Einstein or Stephen Hawking. Usually you can’t find them on a daily basis. 

Then you have the “I don’t know what I want to do with my science degree” students. They’re more than average but work very hard to not be the last 25 percentile of the cohort and fight the bellcurve to get their A. Other than studying, they basically have not much life. These are your majority. 

Did somebody ask me about those who party? They get buried alive by the smart and average.

Excuse me. Who says at my age cannot like kpop? I can like whatever and whoever Twice, Blackpink, GOT7, BTOB, Sunmi, 2NE1, EXID and more. Who says I can only like JJ Lin or Sam Smith? Ok I also like listening to those songs but who says I cannot like Korean music? Got age limit is it?

52192,"I don't want to look at my body and think it's disgusting anymore. With all that talk about healthy living/eating - I think it's important to differentiate what it means to LOOK healthy vs. FEEL healthy. I don't feel healthy or happy when I force myself to run 5 times a week, 3-4 km at a time. I feel bored, I dread running, I hate the way it makes my knees feel and the ache in my lungs.  I also hate those stupid cardio workouts on youtube, with some lady screaming at you to get your butt higher, to lift stronger, to ""GET THOSE MUSCLES"" and ""GET THAT SUMMER BOD"". No. Stop.

I know exercising is good for your body - but when my goal of exercising is to conform to impossible standards of what the ideal body looks like in today's societies - I feel sad. I feel stressed out when my body doesn't look a certain way, I hate the way I angle myself in the mirror so the sunlight hits correctly and I can see the contours where I want them to - as if that even means anything. It has become obsessive. It is unhealthy. 

I hate the instinctive, unconscious manner I reach out to touch my stomach and absolutely hating its softness - the pooch you get after eating (what do they call it - food baby?). I remember I used to ask my friends ""how are your stomachs so flat after eating"" and being so envious that they seemed like they never had to worry about flabby-anything. I hate how I see my thighs as abominably fat when it is the same pair of muscles that carry me everywhere I go. I hate having to feel bad about my body parts - because there's nothing wrong with them, no matter what others say about it. 

I want to learn how to love my body again.  "

Would like to ask if exchanges between Singapore universities are common?

Just saw the cute guy I've been seeing around my faculty wearing an SMU shirt out and was wondering if he might be on exchange here.

Then again my faculty isn't business so I'm pretty sure you can't go on exchange from SMU here... So maybe he just got the shirt from a friend. But damn he really looks good in it???

52184,"With paragraphs. Been good friends with this girl for a few years. We came from the same family background: not very well off, and we have similar family problems. We care deeply for our families. She once went through a bitter breakup/broken engagement and i always try to be there for her, listening or giving moral support. She has been there occasionally for my problems too. The past year she suddenly went cold to me by keeping a distance. At first i thought it was because she felt bothered by my family problems. 

Then again i did not ask for much. I just wanted to speak with someone on the phone and i asked if she could speak to me just one time on the phone. She said no she is busy she is tired. Then she went online facebook and uploaded a lot of photos of her ""fun"" days. And commented on peoples photos. One of my family member was in hospital and on the verge of dying. I didnt know what to do and when i asked to speak to her because i was scared, she gave those excuses. 

Another time we bumped into each other. I was with my friends, some foreigners and locals. She was with her new boyfriend. I greeted her and she didnt seem happy to see me. She claimed she was in a hurry and did not make an effort to introduce her new bf. We got stuck at the traffic light for a while and the whole time she made sure both her new bf and she did not look at me. I was aware of her new bf for some time so it was not a surprise, but we just have not been formally introduced. It is fine w me but what she did later upset me. She looked at my friends and later said in a condesending tone, ""these are your friends? Never knew you had such friends."" I was surprised and just brushed it aside. 

Later she texted me and said she was off to somewhere so no time to talk. The truth is we were stuck at the same traffic light and later on same bus stop. My friends told me it was strange she did not introduce the bf to me. And they said maybe it is because she didnt want him to know me. I am shocked. She knows i absolutely have someone else in mind and would never go for her bf. I have avoided her since then because her actions have made me realise that she was never a true friend. 

Perhaps a friend that needed my moral support but when i needed hers she cannot even bother to call or talk. A friend who was ""jealous"" or afraid that her new bf will be friends w me even though she introduced her new bf to other friends. A friend that judges my other friends. A friend that was just making use of me all along. 

I have held back my words so far on how sometimes i feel that she can be quite fake at times. When we go out and take photos, i take for remembrance. But She tags me on fb and says things like "" oh yet another crazy day i have to listen or entertain my friend while i cant say anything"". It feels very insulting because i thought we met up because we wanted to catch up. I wasnt the only one talking abt my probs. She talks abt her probs and insecurities too. I dont know. Do most of you behave this way w friends? 

She will also tag me that i treated dinner and drinks for her birthday and all that. But she never once treated or asked me out for my birthday. Not even for coffee/teh. 

She makes a lot of effort for her other friends who are pretty successful in life (good jobs and happy relationships) like making hand made cards or gifts for them, plans food outings with them and treats them to expensive meals and all. For me? None. Pls dont be mistaken i am greedy. Yes i am jobless on some months. Yes my family has a lot of probs. Yes i am single and probably unwanted. But i am sure i treated her as well as a true friend can be. 

In her fb she keeps saying all ""positive and motivational"" messages publicly and how to be kind and live life ""great"" and how good one has to be. But when it comes to your one friendship, you surely are a big hypocrite. 

To add on, there was a period when i was unemployed and searching for jobs. Her department had 2 full time open vacancies for entry degree holders and she never once told me about it. I know because another friend works in the same civil service place as her and told me about it. We werent close but i appreciated her gesture. 

When i finally got a job elsewhere by myself and she knew about it, she contacted me and i dont know if she was pretending or what. She offered me a ""2 or 3 months contract job that required only o levels"" in that same department of hers. I declined and told her i was working for a year already and told her that she knew. She said "" in case you need a job again and also this job is better than nothing"" implying that i would be jobless again soon or that i was expected to quit my current job for her offer. 

Last i saw, she has been promoted to a senior manager in that dept. Never knew she didnt want me on her team because she thought i would be an obstacle to her promotion. 

Another time i asked if her friend could help give my resume to his company, a bank. Both of them readily accepted my resume but just kept quiet after that. I followed up but he said he already gave to hr. Last i heard he went for my job in my previous company. She knew about it but pretended not to know and continued hanging out with him. Maybe because he has a house and is more successful than me? 

I know you probably think i am so stupid to continue the friendship that time. But i have learnt my lesson well. "

How do you reject him/her without harming your precious friendship that you have forged over the years? 

Answer : your bff status is officially doomed the moment you say no. Find a new close friend.

I had a very close friend. We could talk about so many things, and we could relate to each other for most of them. My friends told me how it was so obvious I liked him because a rare smile (yes, that unique one you'll give when you fall for someone) would only appear when I mention him or I see his texts. One fine day, I plucked up my courage and confessed and he tells me ""oh I only like you as a awesome pal"". I force a smile and say ""it's ok, we are still good friends then"" and still try to carry on with our regular friendly conversations. 

Needless to say, over time his enthusaism dwindled and his replies become noticeably slower and shorter, and our special friendship fizzled out miserably (at least for me, I would never know how he felt) 

x2

I go and talk to my friends for support, and they all comfort me 

with similar tales for both genders. 

So if your friendship is already going to be dead, the excuse of ""I don't want to ruin our special friendship because what if we break up?"" is totally bullshit.

IT IS ALREADY RUINED. 

It is actually best for both of you to attempt a relationship together because even if it fails due to a lack of romantic feelings, you two at least tried, and both of you are convinced that it wouldn't work 

And I'm sure I don't need to elaborate on the awesome perks of being in a relationship with someone who knows you really well loves your company and accepts you for who you truly are

If there is, I would look through all the new posts, to see who liked / commented on the post, and check out those people to see their relationship. If there isn't any new posts, I'll check on the person's friends' accounts to see if I catch any glimpse of the person. Every night, I would see if the person has followed / added new people, or any new followers / friends. And go through the list to find out who. I've done it so many times that I can possibly remember every single one on the list.

Met this girl, let's call her C, in J2 after Prelims. She seemed nice, quite reserved can be pretty animated once you get her fired up. We met during a supplementary lesson for KI since we both got rekt by the paper, and we kinda hit it off well right from the start.

Well one fine day we decided to go out for a date over the weekend. And at the end of that date, I walked her back home and I'll just say that her house's front yard is as big as a small neighborhood park. Okay that may be a slight exaggeration but it was huge.

Alright so SES divide notwithstanding, we went Dutch on most things except gifts, obviously, and we were kinda cool for the first few months.

She'd always said that she hadn't dated anyone before, and that she hadn't had any male friends growing up so she said it was refreshing to have me.

Well I found out that she'd had 3 boyfriends previously so obviously that was a big fat lie. And did I mention her temper? She'd flip out at a drop of a hat.

Her 18th birthday came up and her dad got her a necklace. One with diamonds on it. One that costs more than most people's wedding rings. And she complained that it wasn't flashy enough. And so she got a second one, now flashier.

Her monthly shopping bill comes up to about twice the minimum wage. She's never learned how to do housework, never learned how to fend for herself and her cooking skills stop short of cooking water. She can't.

And then I found out from one of her old friends and a good friend of mine that she'd been in a relationship with this one guy for... Go on take a guess. 

It's not just a couple of years. It was closer to 10 years. Mind you we were in jc and that was more than half our lives at that point.

I also found out that she'd cheated on him through multiple well meaning friends who, concerned for me, were worried I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
Well, I didn't.

They'd broken up because of this whole thing. And I thought, hey, if she could cheat on this dude she's been with for freaking 10 years, what about me who's not even been here for 10 months? I'd wanted to hear her end of it, because barring some massive vindication factor, this was a deal breaker for me.

When I asked her about this, not in a hostile confrontation with her or anything, just wanting to clear it up, she flipped out and asked me why I'd been snooping around. Like er, well, shouldn't the question be why'd you hide it? And like, shouldn't the entire issue be that you saw fit to hide something this large from me?

But no, she went on a tirade about why she was entitled to hide whatever she wanted to hide and do whatever she wanted to do. In the argument, she threw her necklace out the window. You know, the one that costs 5 months salary? Yeah that one.

Sheesh, what a spoilt brat.

We broke up on the spot.

Last I heard, she's dating her 19th guy. For context, I'm 22 this year. And last I heard, she's a serial cheater. Haha, good riddance. Guess nobody likes a cheater then.

She'd always said that she hadn't dated anyone before, and that she hadn't had any male friends growing up so she said it was refreshing to have me.

Well I found out that she'd had 3 boyfriends previously so obviously that was a big fat lie. And did I mention her temper? She'd flip out at a drop of a hat.

Her 18th birthday came up and her dad got her a necklace. One with diamonds on it. One that costs more than most people's wedding rings. And she complained that it wasn't flashy enough. And so she got a second one, now flashier.

Her monthly shopping bill comes up to about twice the minimum wage. She's never learned how to do housework, never learned how to fend for herself and her cooking skills stop short of cooking water. She can't.

And then I found out from one of her old friends and a good friend of mine that she'd been in a relationship with this one guy for... Go on take a guess. 

It's not just a couple of years. It was closer to 10 years. Mind you we were in jc and that was more than half our lives at that point.

I also found out that she'd cheated on him through multiple well meaning friends who, concerned for me, were worried I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
Well, I didn't.

They'd broken up because of this whole thing. And I thought, hey, if she could cheat on this dude she's been with for freaking 10 years, what about me who's not even been here for 10 months? I'd wanted to hear her end of it, because barring some massive vindication factor, this was a deal breaker for me.

When I asked her about this, not in a hostile confrontation with her or anything, just wanting to clear it up, she flipped out and asked me why I'd been snooping around. Like er, well, shouldn't the question be why'd you hide it? And like, shouldn't the entire issue be that you saw fit to hide something this large from me?

But no, she went on a tirade about why she was entitled to hide whatever she wanted to hide and do whatever she wanted to do. In the argument, she threw her necklace out the window. You know, the one that costs 5 months salary? Yeah that one.

Sheesh, what a spoilt brat.

We broke up on the spot.

Last I heard, she's dating her 19th guy. For context, I'm 22 this year. And last I heard, she's a serial cheater. Haha, good riddance. Guess nobody likes a cheater then.

Well she's in NUS too, so if she's reading this... Well who cares. That's not even the correct initial I gave."

52119,"I’m in GES1021, Natural Heritage and I never knew there were no web lectures until I actually got the module...

I’ve been skipping lectures, I can’t bring myself to go for anything in school at all except for tutorials 

The thing about GES1021 is that there is a group project, I have a group and I’ve been contributing actively on the research aspect. However I think one of my group mates is pissed at me cause I keep skipping lectures.. 

Anyone out there took GES1021 and skipped lectures too? will skipping lectures affect my grades adversely? Or can I just read the textbook and notes? "

52110,"Ok don’t be shocked guys. Last semester, during special term, I am dating this guy. He stays in UTown (one of the colleges) and he used to bring me back to his room for some bang bang action. I thought he loves me but sadly, he doesn’t. He only wants me as his sexual relief. I knows during our relationship, he went around preying other girls. We broke up and I cut connections with him. However, recently he texted me telling me how sad he is now for being alone. I know he’s hated by a lot of people from his RC and I feel pity for him. Should I approach him again? 
No plot twist guys, I am biologically a girl. "

52107,"Not looking to throw shade or anything but I really don't understand when my Med friends complain about how hard it is to get into residency (their specialist training program).

To be a GP with excellent work-life balance? Meanwhile, I don't even know if I can hold down a job when I graduate...

However, upon uploading it on turnitin, the wordcount miraculously increased. Is there a difference in how Word & turnitin counts the number of words? Also, are in-text citations (those citations bracketed at the end of sentences) included in the word count? Please please do help out. I don't have any seniors I can turn to to ask about this... Will really appreciate this...."
52105,"/* This may be uncomfortable to read for some. */

I am so tired of this shit. It happens time and time again and I am so damn sick of it. 

Why must sex always be a factor in a relationship? Why can't anyone respect the fact that there are women who desire to remain abstinent? I don't dress provocatively and I have never even been to the club before. I study hard, don't really go out, and seldom post stuff on my social media. I am basically a boring no-life nerd. I don't know why I am attracting such guys. 

My previous 2 relationships ended mainly because of my unwillingness to engage in sexual activities with them. And now, my current boyfriend whom I love very much is doing the same thing to me. The difference is that this time round, the relationship has gone too far to break. We have been together for 3 years and I love him very much. 

But honestly, I am so sick of it. Every day, I look at myself disgusted. Because I was not strong enough to resist. And because of how weak and pathetic I am, I have tainted myself. I gave it to him because I loved him too much. Sex has become my living nightmare which I have no escape from. I despise what I have become but I can't bring myself to hate him. I love him too much. I just feel so weak, so dirty and so alone. I know I can never be clean again."

52103,"I am a science student... I wanted to be a dentist. Everytime I travel to school, pass by the faculty, see dental undergrads, i cant help but feel ashamed. I feel embarassed. I feel that i do not deserve to even exist. I am nothing compared to them. 3 more years to go.


The overwhelming desire to respond to calls of the abyss.
So tempting."
52102,"I always wondered, how in the world do most students take notes so fast during lectures? I can hardly write down my notes while listening to the lecturer at the same time. If I do the former, I lose out on the latter (so I miss out on the next important stuff the lecturer is saying). It's incredibly frustrating and really tearing me down in my studies. Meanwhile if I just sit down there and listen, I can absorb the info but then I can't take down any notes!! It's even more stressful when everyone around you is easily typing down their notes word-by-word from the lecturer's mouth on the laptops like robots. 
It makes me feel so...inferior...that I can't keep up as the pathetic slow learner I am.

It's sad how they always tell students to adapt to their learning style, yet the school system is not. Is it not always to the advantage of those who have fast brains and can multi-task?
