53098,"Is it normal to not feel anything when a guy confess to me/go out with me? Like even when he highlights that he likes me and I go out to eat with him. 

At the end of the day, there are no butterflies in my stomach nor do I particularly like/dislike the dinner. I'm just ""dinner?"" ""Okay."" Then we talk and he gets sweet and starts talking about a future with me but I find it super awkward and just let him talk. When he held my hand, I don't have the urge to grasp it nor push it away. What does it mean?

I'm pretty sure I'm heterosexual btw."
53097,Is majoring in psych really impractical in Singapore? So far everyone that I’ve met has tried to dissuade me from majoring in psych. My dream job is to be a clinical psychologist but everyone just scoffs when I say that. Should I just give up on psych? I’m a Y1 so I can still give up while I can. Please give me some advice..
53096,"I'm not sure if this has ever been suggested, but I'd leave it here for all to consider.

Recall back to your primary and secondary school days when there were four academic terms in a year. Each term had its own assessments for a few topics from each subject syllabus. Having the tests bite-sized helped us enjoy studying and focused better throughout each term.

We do have Special Terms now and I'm sure there are good reasons why the two Special Terms aren't combined to make a Special Semester.

Perhaps, the teaching period could be modified to become two-term in place of a semester. Delivery for a typical 4MC module can span 6 weeks, and then ends with a Term Exam to conclude the module. For modules such as FYP, of course, it can continue to run through 2 terms, that's fine.

On the average, single major undergraduates would then offer 10MCs per term, with fewer gaps between lessons from the same module, through which students and faculty can achieve a seamless teaching and learning experience. This would also help us the students retain knowledge as a result of more focused attention on a particular module. On a side note, having 4 terms instead of 2 semesters also help reduce course bidding problems and  helps provide greater flexibility!

The above my two cents on the changes to learning possibilities, what do you think? :)"

53094,"You might know how I feel but I have no idea how do you feel about me. When it's all good, we can simply talk for hours, enjoy each other's company and you'll be everywhere I go. Yet when you choose to go silent, you can just seemingly disappear and behave as though we are strangers; I can't believe I have put up with this for the past several months since I've confessed. Now I truly wonder if I'm ever in your thoughts or am I just a toy to you? "

53092,"@ #53029 Why are you shaming girls who wear ""thick"" makeup? There's already so much pressure surrounding body image for women (I'm not saying men don't have any at all, but the pressure to look ""pretty"" seems to be more disproportionately present among women) and men like you come along adding fuel to it. What's wrong with wearing makeup to help with self-confidence? In my own personal experience I used to think I was horribly ugly and that nothing but plastic surgery could change me, but with makeup I've realised that I can be pretty when I want to. Red lipstick can make one feel powerful and for me makes me feel a lot more put together. At least we put in a lot of effort to take care of ourselves. Make-up isn't only worn just to please you and/or straight men. Most of us humans are not blessed with naturally ""perfect"" appearances, and I'm 90% sure you aren't the next Singaporean Adonis with a jawline carved by the gods either (if you are, congrats on the genetic lottery I guess). Don't insult the hard work that others put into themselves, and make it seem as if girls are vain for trying to look good just because we don't roll out of bed and straight to school like (most) guys do. If you continue with this misogynistic attitude towards makeup, don't worry, the girls with thick makeup also don't want you.

(Sorry if this sounds like a disorganised SJW rant. I'm not usually the kind to start drama over the Internet, but as a girl, a makeup hobbyist and a friend to many other girls who are constantly trying their best to look good everyday, I can't help but angry at this kind of attitude. Seriously, @ men, it's not attractive. Heck, it would be extra attractive if you went the extra mile and noticed say, my winged eyeliner, shows you take an interest to the girl's interests and not look down on it as if female hobbies are 'lesser' than male hobbies. Argh.)"

There won't be any face exposure so I'm not too worried if it kenna leaked or anything. It's hot to me too but I don't know if I should even be entertaining such thoughts. Do ppl actually record what they do in the privacy of their bedroom? Or should we just enjoy the moment and not focus so much on video recording and finding the best ""angles""? "

53087,"to #52958: I am the author of #52900 
Yeah mine was a similar predicament, so I applied to those in more affordable countries (not approved by SMC), but was rejected a couple of times. 

Put yourself out there to experience new things, talk to people about what you want to do, then you would realise what is practicable and whether you had over-idealised your dream. That's why doing shadowing and volunteering may help. If you can envision yourself working in that setting in the future, you would be more motivated to continue pursuing the dream.

For me, at this point, closing in on graduation, I start to see the possible job prospects should I graduate from my current course. I start to waver a little considering how I may still find something suitable for me in this industry if I ultimately don't do medicine. I have come to terms with the fact that while Medicine is my first choice, there are many other ways I can contribute to a good cause with my skillsets. My 'backup plan' is to work with NGOs after getting some years of work experience, so I am currently quite at peace with myself should I not obtain admittance to med school. Anyway, no med school means I get a life. If you think that life is hard now, it may be worse in med school, so there is nothing to 'complain' about at this stage.

While the future seems bleak, while 4 years may seem like a long wait, be at peace with yourself and live your life to the fullest. I understand your worry and anxiety as I was where you were. If you were meant to be a medical doctor, it would happen somehow, and since a part of it would be dependent on what you do now, don't leave regrets:)"
53082,"I don't know if I am weird. I've seen a few people on their last few moments of life. Once, I met a lady who was on morphine. We were seeing her to sign her will. You could sense the pain when she was taking her breath. She passed away the next morning. Another time an alleged suicide as I saw the body being brought out. Everyone around always feel sad for these people.

But sometimes I felt different. I always felt a sense of envy towards them. Somehow, I felt that there was this sense of peace that everyone feel moments before they took their last breath. A peace which I seemed to want as well. That at that last few seconds... they would have the answer for everything. For the days, the hours, the years. The sad and the happy. An answer only they would know. A peace only they could feel. Perhaps because the fact that the struggles of life didn't matter anymore..."

53080,"In respnse to #53037: All too often we've heard similar stories wrt ""platonic"" guy-girl friendships - guys always being ""second fiddle"" with a girl that has apparently decided that he will never be good enough but strings him along anyway for a sense of emotional security. Guys need to have a greater sense of dignity, and that does mean knowing when to pull the plug on the friendship when it's become clear the girl is using him. Friendship is a two-way street, and even if we all did believe it were possible to remain friends in the face of a one-sided crush, there are ways the party who's not interested can let the other party down easy and continue the friendship. But it'll come as no surprise that just like in the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"", guys and girls can rarely if ever just be friends. The only way is probably if they're both dating other people, or both would never consider each other. But more often than not, feelings from one party will develop over time, quite often unreciprocated. The sooner we accept this truth, the sooner we can all guard our hearts and not get hurt. Move on to another girl who you might actually have a chance with? And unfortunately, it does mean distancing yourself from the girl who's been stringing you along all this while - she does not deserve your friendship. Also, if we could all learn how not to lead people on (by being more conscious of signals from the other side, and knowing how to signal back), we'd save everyone a lot of heartache. "

53078,"I have such strong role models that are simply impossible to emulate. Not necessarily because they are ""too good"" but more because:

Why police the residents so much, if no one causes any actual trouble why are they cruisin for a bruisin, looking to start shit?

All these people had to do was stay at home. They could be spending quality time with their family, binging a miniseries, doing actual work, whatever. 

Literally anything else other than being an asswipe.

Hear someone causing a ruckus? Residents complain to you about inappropriate decorations or behavior? One dude's shoes blocking half the damn corridor? Please, go ahead and be a hero. It'll make the college a better place to live.

If not, sit the hell down. I bet my ass ~95% of the time, there probably isn't anything actually bothering anyone. It's creating problems for the sake of creating problems.

The interview only lead you to be a working slave for the rest of your life. 4 years of your time, could spend on learning more useful stuffs, like family planning, how CPF works, how to buy HDB, buying investment products like stock, reit, future, etc. Only doing business and investment, will lead you to a better life.

A suggestion for whoever is hosting/emceeing the dialogue session - Could you use a site such as archipelago.comp.nus.edu.sg to moderate the session?

1. disbanding the entire student council and forming a new group with specially selected people overnight because the head of the council questioned her (sounds like a news report straight out of russia)

2. waking people up at 6am just to ask them to keep 1 pair of shoes

3. barging into people's room unannounced without even knocking 

4. covertly watching specific people without them knowing through various means

5. editing rules of the spot and creating unofficial rules to the person's own liking

these are just some of the things that were done in rvrc. if you ask me it sounds like something a corrupt tyrant would do but hey who am i to judge right? judge for yourselves. if you think that this isnt the life for you then stay far far away from rvrc. peace out"
