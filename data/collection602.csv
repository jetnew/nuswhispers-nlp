60299,Any chemical engineering students can help me out? Is it better for me to do Bachelor of Chemical Engineering then do Master in Business/Finance under the E-scholar Programme or do a Double Degree in Chem Eng & Business? 
60298,"I recently went back to NUS for a career fair to promote my current company, hiring software developers and data analysts. I was surprised by the ratio of candidates looking for software development vs 'data science' roles. For every 1 CV I received for software development, I received something like 5-8 'data science' CV. In terms of actual positions available, the ratio should have been reversed! Further, most of our data science roles require masters degree and above. 

Granted, data-savviness  is a plus in almost all roles, candidates specifically looking for 'data science' roles are shooting themselves in the foot because (1) purely data science roles are limited, and (2) Bachelors' are often not sufficient for those roles.

Instead, what is really short in the market are people who can write software. People who can write good, clean code, who can build scalable systems, and, who can understand algorithmic time complexity and make appropriate trade-offs - software engineers in essence. 

My advice to those who are still in school: Focus on your fundamentals. Don't get seduced by the latest fads, there are far more jobs out there for software engineers than 'data scientist'."
60296,"May I know if there is a way to join the NUS Computing Club? 
Been receiving weekly email from them but I don't feel like part of them...
Thanks! "
60294,"#60102 - happiness is subjective, i can't claim to know what makes you happy, or if they're ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""socially trendy to have"". However, i date say that your understanding of the average person around you is superficial at best.

The person thinking about BTO? he might be chasing it because it makes him happy to spend time with his wife in a place they can call their own.

The person thinking about pay? he might be a huge gaming nerd who blows dollars on his gaming rig and vidya (that's me). 

The person who wants a car? he might derive his happiness from long quiet drives, or frequent road trips up north (further than jb)

The person who sells his soul to his employer might be doing so because the job is fun, challenging, meaningful.

The people worrying about wedding costs / great vacations might be materialistic,, who are we to judge if that makes them happy. 

The rest of the faceless people you think have no soul? they might be dancers, part time volunteers, artists, Han culture enthusiasts, amateur home chefs or semi pro gamers. You don't see it because you don't look hard enough.

Projecting your own version of happiness on people and calling them boring because their only source of fun is that one vacation a year shows how much you understand your peers. It also reflects poorly on you.

If you want to get to know a person, look at who they choose to spend their time with. If you feel like you're surrounded with boring people, consider the possibility that your own personality is the one that's keeping you from meeting the cool ones. Don't just talk to people, understand them.Peace out


#60259: ""bla bla bla life sucks in singapore and girls are either arrogant or meek also they don't ask me on dates"" - you dont get to meet the cool people and attend house parties because you're genuinely uninteresting as a person, grow up and stop feeling entitled to chicken soup for the whiny soul™ that you obviously made 0 effort to reach for...

Also, if you truly believe that professors are mediocre because they don't know more than that 1 subject that they dedicated their entire lives to understand, i also believe that uni education is wasted on you."
60292,Read a career tracks book and found out that most engineering graduates end up in the electrical/electronics industry even for chemical engineering and materials engineering graduates. May I know why this is so and if the electrical/electronics industry is still prospering?
60291,"Hi ppl, this is a guy's reponse to the post #60258. Tbh i don't think the op is victim shaming anyone, just maybe a bit overproductive? Cos I feel that victimshaming is to blame the victim for their dressing, but the op clearly didn't do that. And I feel that he has some rights to be protective over his girlfriend because u can't deny that if there was a sexual criminal on the loose and his potential victims are 2 very similar girls, one wearing more revealing clothes than the other, the girl who is more revealing is in greater danger. Yes, it doesn't resolve the fact that some other girl is still in danger, but at least 'my' girl is safer. 

Would like to seek some opinions about this matter, from a guy in my first relationship. "
60289,to the OP of #60256. Well this is because it doesnt make sense to penalise a poly student with 3.98 or 3.99 just because he got a B+ for a non-core and straight As for the rest of his modules? On top of that most of the diploma with merit students with significant coding experience are not complaining about CS2030 and CS2040 unlike you AAA/A students?

I'm sorry for your plight. Without a certificate from second schedule universities, you can only qualify for temporary registration. Find a hospital that willing to take you as temp reg. And the Hosp needs to renew every 6mths for you. If you notti, they can revoke it. So this is not ideal.

The only way for you to practise on a more permanent basis is to get your mrcs or mrcp, then you can qualify for conditional registration.

Alternative way is to become a full pledged specialist in the UK or USA or Australia, then migrate back to Singapore.

Your basic MBBS from some random university is not recognised by smc, but nobody will care about that when your post graduate qualifications enables you to qualify for the specialist register in UK or USA or Australia.

Don't give up. See you in five to seven years.

60286,Really confused about the bell curve....does it mean that there bound to be someone get failed(F) even though the class only has 50 students and all students get grades above 60?
60285,"Honestly speaking, if SOC is unable to cope with the increase in intake for CS, they should probably just reduce the intake back to the original. Helps to prevent oversupply of computing grads, and each student gets more attention and help from the lecturers. Win win situation."
60284,"Thank you #60284, and many others who replied.
Sorry for the late reply, have been busy battling the bell curve.

I completely agree with you that the only reason Pharmacy and Nursing are curved is their ""traditional judgement"" of how these courses are Science courses. While this answer is politically correct, it vastly differs from the pragmatic approach our education system usually takes. 

As we all know, the bell curve is a prospective assignment of the normal distribution to grades, i.e. a cohort is expected to fare in an expected spread of grades. However, courses like Pharmacy and Nursing are heavily ""regimented"" in a fixed curriculum such that there is a fixed set of knowledge and skillset that every nurse or pharmacist is expected to possess in order to be competent in their roles. The implication of the bell curve is that students become more competitive over every single detail (to the point of unnecessity to fulfil job requirements) such that grades bear no significant meaning other than how exam-ready one is. Employers are as such given the liberty to be more selective of ""better"" students, and students who are not so exam smart but probably extremely capable at work are deprived of an opportunity to be employed. Hence my true question is, ""given the limitations of an educational institute to assess students' job performance, is this (the bell curve) really the best way to differentiate students?""

Also, I do agree that a pharm/nursing student need not see being a registered pharmacist or nurse as a be-all-end-all goal. There are certainly other opportunities to explore. Be that as it may, that does not mean that doctors are receiving the short-end of the stick. Similarly, many do not even stick to the major they read after graduating. Dr M is one such example. Regardless, Pharmacy has come up with a new Pharmaceutical Science major. I believe it's clear that Pharmacy was intended to be clinically-driven."
60283,"My boyfriend is never worried about my safety, e.g. even the grabcar driver seemed more concerned and questioned if he is my bf. He seems nonchalent when i confided in him abt someone who has dirty hands who anyhow touch. He is never worried if i have enough to eat even though i willingly sacrificed to take the smaller portion food to let him have the bigger portion. Main point is I dont feel loved and cared. And he sounded like its an obligation for him when he does things for me like arranging valentine's day lunch to prevent me from nagging/getting angry.  :(  Am i being too demanding? Or are most guys like this in a relationship? Ever discussed with him these issues n he always denies the above issues and I start to swallow all the above thoughts n sad feelings to myself but secretly dont think we will be happy together in future. Will things always get worse after marriage? Or am i being too much? I feel i get more satisfaction when im w my female frens than bf"
60282,"Just wanna ask anyone accepts/objects about your current partner contacting their ex. How often? How do you feel? 

During the start of my relationship my partner and ex whatsapp everyday, meet up once a week. I told him it makes me feel uncomfortable. Right now he still contacts her but 2-3 days a week and meet up once a month. Just a very brief story here."
60281,"Reading #60281 reminds me of a guy friend I used to be close to. He also talked to me about his pessimism, until I started to find him annoying. Apparently, he didn't talk to others about it because he found me motherly to talk to. I am actually more than 5 years older than him. He still texts me about simple things he is unsure of to ask me for help, but I will remind him those stuff are Google-able. Feelings are clear that I do not enjoy babysitting him anymore."

If that's you then I guess maybe we can get coffee someday :)? "
60279,"In reply to #60248
Honestly CS2030 and CS2040 is just the tip of the iceberg of what else is to come. Try doing the other cs mods. Theres some where the lecturer dumps you a group project to work on and expects you to finish in a month even though you have no idea how to start.
Im seriously having enough of the freshmen this year."
60277,"#60250: totally possible, although I don’t know where 30% of your module went to. I score 100% for a mid-terms before (30% weightage) and couldn’t do like 85% of the final exam (70% weightage). I scored a B+. If I actually revised for the exam, I would have gotten at least an A-, sigh."
60274,"My mind is going insane spontaneously. Since enlistment, I've been juggling myself in a triangle, between camp, family, and my boyfriend.
In camp, numerous gossips and backstabbing are going among my platoon about me, superior commenting about my lack of focus for my men and constantly on the phone (actually I'm updating other section sgts) .
In family, even tho my mom is often overseas working on her company, she is constantly ranting about depressing story to me, in turns making myself feel guilty for not being there for her. My dad works overseas too, when he is back, he always demand service for him, thinking that he is the king of the family, everyone have to obey whatever he said.
For my boyfriend, he needs lots and lots of attention, every Saturday I have to entertain him for the whole freaking day to make it up for the time I'm not with him, pampering him like he is my gem, but he is also saying that I'm distant from him. 
For the entire week, the only time to myself is when I'm sleeping and during short breaks in camp. I have totally no idea what how can I do to keep things up and balance everything in my life. Seeking some advise from y'all guys. ☹️"
60271,There are a lot more complaints about CS modules as compared to previous years. I wonder why that is? I don't see students from other faculties complaining as much about their modules.
60270,"Regarding the increased intake in CS, I actually appreciate how NUS has managed it.

I’m on exchange now, and it’s much worse at other universities, there are as many students enrolled as there are waitlisted for some of the core modules. And anyone can just anyhow start a minor in CS.

At least at NUS it is simple to secure our core modules with the MPE. Also, don’t worry about Orbital, you can always do a project on your own over the summer, or an internship is even better.

I always thought relationships bloom through close friendships (and breaking the friendzone) in SG culture. Am I wrong all this time? Since when are Singaporeans all so upfront? 

Maybe I should try approaching the next pretty girl I see and just asking for her number."

So is there any other way fr me to find out if he likes me too without asking him out? Thank u :)"
60261,"I can’t really move on from my break up so I deleted my ex on social media.

He sometimes reply to my story on ig (you would say that’s a good sign but no). he reply to my story on insta and I reply to his reply then guess what. he just ignore me. He did not even read it. (I guess I’m abit too stalkerish to see if he seen the message). On another occasion,  he will proceed on to reply my story again. I don’t know if I want to reply him this time round because it feels like he just want to say something and is not interested in what I want to say. I really don’t get it though. Why bother to reply my story and not read my answer? Might as well don’t ask la...

You knew from the start they're seeing someone else.
It didn't matter to you; they were just a friend you saw in tutorial. Every week, you walk into class and settle down next to them.
It starts out just focusing on work-related things. How to solve this and that tutorial question. Almost business-like. But soon you find common interests. Soon you find them laughing, and they're making you laugh too. Soon you find a friend you can trust.
And it goes on. You start looking forward to these tutorials every week. Just that 1 hour of class that used to be so boring has become so entertaining, so exciting -- it's now the highlight of your week. It's not so much the content, but the time spent with them. Perhaps you even muster the courage to ask them out for meals, and to study together outside of class.
And then comes the fall.
Their smile, their voice, their humour, their mindset, their reactions, their outlook on life. You fall for every detail. And it's a deep fall. You want to spend every day with this person, you want to go through life's ups and downs with them. You know you complement each other well. They match your needs and you match theirs perfectly.

Your actions reflect those of a person who is desperate for companionship and that is an immediate no-no.

I may sound harsh here, but I sincerely just want to help. Seriously, invest in yourself - physically, mentally, emotionally, financially etc - and I dare you to return without results.

60230,Saw comments on confession #60069 about the competitiveness of chemical engineering and was extremely horrified knowing I have a spot in NUS for chemical engineering. Are other branches of engineering as bad/difficult as chemical engineering? I'm reconsidering changing course from chemical engineering to mechanical engineering.
60229,"With regards to the rants of CS2030, while I agree that some parts of the module could be better improved, such as the last minute releasing of practical assessment scope (although i can understand that the lecturer had emergency situations at home but I feel that the other lecturers or TA could help post the announcement), I feel that the module isn't as bad as what everyone here is making it out to be. As someone who has taken many CS modules already and currently taking CS2030 with no Java and OOP background, there are several modules out there where you have to google all your answers especially for the coding assignments. You will realise some of the assignments are totally different from whatever has been taught in class. That's because theory and practical application are always different. People always told you whatever you learn in school won't apply to your jobs eventually right? Then, will you complain of how the professors don't spoonfeed you everything? This is university, one should be prepared to be a more independent learner.
Also, the complaining of how the lectures are useless. I disagree to a pretty large extent. Every live demo that the lecturer makes has a point. Showing how certain code works and how certain codes don't. It's through this we learn how the Java compiler works so that we won't commit the mistakes. If you feel it hard to catch up during the actual lecture, I really suggest you to webcast it. Rewind back whenever you need to, it really helps in understanding. :)
However, I agree with the module's workload is  higher than most modules. It might be because CS2030 and CS2040 are both foundation modules which help us to build a stronger foundation for our other modules, and as these modules are heavily based on coding practices so the module workload is very high (because most of us need alot of time to debug too). To all CS2030 coursemates, all the best and let's last through this semester ! The higher level modules may be slightly better (or is it because I got used to it?). Let's stop complaining about our professors. To be honest, I think they are some of the better professors in SOC."

But how else can I feel but that way, when nobody knows what I feel anyways. 

I always want to be a good person to others. Fulfilling promises for others, helping others with academic work etc. However, it seems to me that I would have difficulty getting help for myself. I wished I had friends whom could initiate meetups, instead of me trying to do that all the time. Getting ignored and rejected, despite after doing things for others... it just feels so painful.

The issue with not having enough resources to cater to the recently 'balloon-ed' cohort size does not apply to just Orbital only.

So, the most recent experience was my most memorable. To give you, the reader, an idea of the circumstances, this happened at a cafe in the heartlands. The Ah Soh suddenly kiap her handbag and we just took our seats. Since I was seating diagonally opposite her, I could catch her making side glances.

I felt annoyed but thankfully the event was short lived. The watch dealer I was meeting arrived. He took out the gold Rolex that I wanted to buy for my dad. In the course of negotiating prices, I took out my own gold Rolex to do comparative Quality Control checks. I noticed the Ah Soh’s demeanor had changed, especially when I took out the cash to pay for the watch. After the dealer left, I happened to turn to “look” at her, it was my golden moment to kiap my Rolexes in her presence :)"

1. “Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part.”
- Last year, 206 teams (412 students) was accepted into Orbital. This year, 576 students are accepted into Orbital. With a 40% increase in intake even though the number of students enrolling into SoC is much lower, how is it fair to say that the coordinator had bad planning? Note that there wasn’t anyone whining about Orbital unlike the kids this year. 

2. “It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day.”
- The coordinator’s job is not to wait for you to apply. The onus is on you to apply before all slots are filled.

1. “So what kind of concerns are there to prevent taking in more students for Orbital? The cohort size is 1k, yet the intake is only 500.”
- Students need to be graded on the level of achievement. This requires manpower nonetheless. The purpose of the module is for seniors to mentor students on taking the first steps towards software engineering, and not a loophole for students to do shit work and get 4MCs. The higher the number of students accepted, the lower the standards of the mentors. 

2. If you can self learn and not go for workshops, why would you even need Orbital? It sounded like you are upset that there isn’t an opportunity to get 4MC even though you supposedly took it. 

3. “If your server could not handle the load of many projects registered, well…”
The purpose of the system is to accept X number of students. Clearly, that purpose has been achieved when 576 students are able to apply for it. 

4. Unfortunately, there is just a limited number of slots available for orbital. That was the same last year, it is the same this year. It has been propagated to the students that there are limited slots and its allocation is FCFS. 

Frankly, the orbital slots are final. There is just no use whining on the telegram group or on NUSWhispers. The amount of whining on these platforms is really alarming and shows the level of entitlement that you have. Just because you are in SoC, just because you are a CS major doesn’t automatically mean you are entitled to participate in Orbital and that all other majors are not as deserving of a slot as you. 

On a personal note, it’s really time for the year 1 CS students to realise that’s CS is not all cushy with free swags, flexible working hours and 5 digits intern pay. You have to earn every single one of them. Whining will get you nowhere.   It’s really time to mature up and actually ask yourself what is important to you. While the top students in SoC earn 10+k monthly, the average CS students don’t even earn half of that. It is really time to wake up and reflect on what you really want to do in NUS, learn about the science of computation, or just get an easy 4MC from Orbital."
60215,The 2 biopsych TAs seem quite brotherly to me as they always joke with each other in lectures. It's a heartwarming sight and I hope they continue to teach together in another module. The one who takes the tutorials explains the answers very clearly too. Both of them are just so kind and approachable!!! 
60213,"Same story with #60132, my boyfriend even watches every fancam he can find of Jennie. I like their music, but I don't get it when he keeps watching the same song performance again and again like the only thing she changes is her outfit. He sometimes gets bored while studying and goes like ""*parroting Jennie's rap in korean* when the bass drop it’s another banger"". He must have practiced a lot as it sounds legit af. Damn, I don't know if I should laugh or complain.

Should I confront him about this?"

What should I do now?"
60210,"To OP of #60181:

I'm sorry to hear that you are in a lot of emotional pain from your first breakup. I know that feeling. When I had my first breakup, the pain was so real my lungs literally hurt. It is as if my sadness turned into a physical grip on my lungs from within and I honestly couldn't breathe. The first night was the worst. I did not sleep at all and every time I closed my eyes, images of us spending time together immediately flashed by like a sappy rom-com and tears just kept flowing from my eyes. I hugged my bolster and all I could think of was how it felt like to be held in his arms. The worst thing is I couldn't stop thinking about the callous good-bye he gave me, the last words he said (and the things he did not say)after all the pathetic pleading and bawling on the phone, begging desperately not to abandon the love we had and the time we spent. 

Despite that, I knew I didn't want him back. Like you, I knew the relationship was bound to fail, so what's the point? 


Our first relationships tend to be very precious because it's the first time you realise how much love you have to give, how much room your heart can offer to the one special, lucky person. We dedicate so much energy and effort to our first love not only because we are blithely ignorant of the dangers that lie ahead, we are also blinded to the possibility that things could ever end. I thought I was going to marry my first boyfriend. Many people would want their first relationship to be the last so they never have to experience any massive heartbreak. Unfortunately, in the modern dating scene, that's hardly possible. 


I just want you to know that things will eventually be okay. I know, this banal proverbial phase is the last thing you want to hear. You may be searching for some ""tough love"" motivational talk urging you to move forward or you may want someone to commiserate with your plight by condemning your ex for ditching you. But these are emotional painkillers which aren't healthy in excessive dosage, and much less effective in treating the actual causes of your pain. In truth, there is no pills/words/encouragement that will instantly do the trick and take away the hurt you feel. 


You have to sit with the pain, let it wash all over you like a tidal wave and soak yourself in the misery until you've finally understood it enough to let it go. Sounds like philosophical fluff, but you have to actually commit yourself to it to grasp its essence.


What you can do now is to give yourself time and understand that things happen, with or without reason. As cliche as that may sound, when has time failed to heal wounds and fade scars? It will be really difficult trying to focus on your assignments/exams/work as images of her face is going to interrupt your waking moments, but these interruptions will gradually lessen. It may sound impossible at this point that you could ever stop thinking of her, about your past, but trust me - you will.


Some things you could do now to facilitate the letting go process: 

1. Remove everything that reminds you of her - presents, soft toys, pictures, PHONE NUMBER, emails, social media accounts. Be thorough, do not even leave a single memorabilia behind that may accidentally remind you of her when you're making progress in the future.


2. As much as you can handle it, continue to stick to your regular routine. She was a huge part of your regular routine, but you (and all of us humans) have the ability to adapt to changes. Do what you always do - go to school, go to work, go to gym, exercise, eat, watch tv, unwind, etc. Just keep being you as much as possible. Yes, there is still a part of your being that belongs to you and only you that she did not and could not take away. Nobody else can except you.


3. Talk about it to your family and friends, once you're ready. Verbalize the emotions, verbalize your thoughts - when the messy tangle of pain you feel is stringed into coherent sentences, for an audience - you, in part, externalize it and distance yourself from it. You rob it of its power to hurt you by materializing it into words, into something you can make sense of with verbal articulation. The empathy you get from your peers and support from your family will help very much. 

Unless this isn't a plausible solution because you don't have a friendly listening ear, write it down in a journal or type it on your phone or computer.


4. Eat healthily and sleep well. This seems irrelevant but I cannot tell you how much your physical state will aid in helping you to pick yourself up. Don't turn to alcohol to drown your sorrow - look at the long-term goals you're trying to achieve and having your body in a good state of health is a good place to start. It's also a way you can start channeling your energy to improve yourself and your life. All the devotion you've put into your past relationship, into her - it's time to invest it in yourself and you'll reap rewards soon enough. 


5. Do not start searching for rebounds/new relationships just to prove that you're still capable of loving and still deserving of love. That means do not download dating apps and delete all of them if you have, because it is tempting. You don't want someone else to get hurt and feel the same pain as you currently do. Rebounds are really the worst ways to recover from break-ups because you're not really recovering, you're just trying to divert the pain to another innocent party.


6. Lastly, forgive her and forgive yourself. Do not hold grudges deep within, do not resent - because you know the futility of it all. Why harbor hatred for someone else that you've once loved so deeply? Hard as it may be, learn to wish her all the happiness she deserves. You loved her for good reasons, and I'm sure in some way, she is still the same person that deserved your love. 


Good luck. And no, becoming reclusive, isolated, wary and jaded of love and people are not necessary what you will be after this experience. You can still love wholeheartedly the next person that touches your heart. The power to choose who you want to be in your next relationship, in your current non-romantic relationships - lies within you. 


To all my damaged souls, I hope you choose to keep your heart open for all the lovely people that may come your way.


P.S. If you need some virtual comfort, leave an anonymous email for contact. I can send some online empathy."

60205,"Why is there always people singing randomly in the staircase near YIH study room? You know that the sound can be hear so loudly inside the study room. Please be considerate, reserve a room for singing."
60200,"Dear #60200,
It is quite simple really. Pharmacy and Nursing are courses that are bell-curved because the admin refuse to allow any changes to occur. Petitions and this idea that bell-curve should be abolished for these courses are not new. Yet we see now the bell-curve.
It is very simple why the admins do not allow for change. Pharmacy and Nursing are just NOT medicine and dentistry. Are they separate faculties? No, Pharmacy is treated as a Science course under FoS and Nursing students graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. If you do not even treat these healthcare courses as individual faculties like you do for dentistry with its small cohort or medicine  what makes you think the admin in NUS actually care about the welfare of these students? Treat them the same way that you treat the Science faculty with the bell-curve treatment that differentiates the students who already are of similar and high caliber for the sake of what? 
You have raised a fair point that I can only answer you that it is because of NUS' own traditional judgement of how these courses should be in terms of being bell-curved in addition to the fact that they are simply Science courses. There is literally no other reason why healthcare courses like Pharmacy and Nursing deserve this separate treatment from dentistry and medicine. 
If you really do want to change though, you can always try petition number 182637163 and see how it goes again. Will you be even given a non-BS explanation I don't know.
