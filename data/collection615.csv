61599,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years and we are both 22 this year and studying. Our relationship is quite stable over the years. Recently, my boyfriend has been enthusiastic about getting married and starting a family young. Our parents have indicated to us that they would give some financial support to us if we get married. I do see a future with him but I'm quite hesitant. Isn't it weird and against society norms if we marry so young? I have never seen couples getting married so young in singapore except if the girl gets pregnant."
61598,"hi op of #61560. I'm in the exact situation as you now and have been crying for the past 2 weeks. I'm at lost too. in case you're still crying, know that you're not alone. I hope you'll be happier soon :)  "
61597,I had a chat with some of my parents' colleagues who studied engineering and I must say it's quite disheartening to hear that many people who majored in engineering do not stay long in the industry and move on to other industries because of various factors such as work-life balance and the pay grade.
61596,"@ #61533: I also noticed this happening for cs2100 assignment 3, it seems like there was significant copying going on. The sad thing is that those who copied for assignment 3 will probably get a better score than those who did it themselves, but it can't be helped. Also, I don't think that the profs can modify the module grading distribution at this point in time. 
Honestly though, this copying is somewhat predictable. Unlike the other 2, assignment 3 is a relatively difficult assignment with no plagiarism check mechanisms in place. Since only the final solution is marked, it becomes easy to mark, and it also becomes easy to copy and get away with it. 
In other words, the solution can be verified quickly, and the problem can be solved quickly.
In other words, P == NP, QED.

61580,"Just wanna say, there’s no responsibility or shared responsibility in fwb. Go google the definition of fwb, it’s an uncommitted sexual relationship with no string attached and no responsibility. 

That’s why the conservative people, good people and religious people condemn fwb because they can’t stand irresponsible and uncommitted relationship. 

Since OP and his gf in post #61519 already agreed to be in irresponsible fwb relationship, why is she still demanding responsibility from guy? 

If she want responsibility, she should have gotten into a legit bgr in the first place, isn’t it? Why fwb when she know it’s gonna be irresponsible and yet still expect guy to be responsible?!"

61568,"To #61519 and any other people who are facing the same issue, as long as you two agreed to sleep together, you two should be responsible for it. It's mentally draining for girls to go clinics and deal with it alone. And it is unfair to push all responsibilities on the guys. 

To guys, a girl can't get pregnant without your sperms. The kid may not be in your body, but you still contributed to the creation of the kid. Go to the clinic with the girl, split the abortion fee, be there with the girl even after the abortion, just go through it together because it's the two of you who made the mistake. 

To girls, the kid is in you, you can't run away from the responsibilities even if you want to. So don't be delusional and say things like 'you got me pregnant!' You can't be pregnant if you don't agree to the sex. It's right to get your fwb to be responsible for it, but not fully responsible. If the guy is there with you throughout the whole journey, be thankful that you are not going through it alone. 

But honestly, if you have a kid, time is crucial. Get it over and done with and quarrel about responsibility later. If you two can't handle the responsibility issue now, you definitely do not want the child to grow bigger to the point where you can't have an abortion and have to talk about another form of responsibility. And if you don't feel old and mature enough to handle such responsibilities, don't get fwbs. "

61564,"Response to #61564 

It is one thing to take a personal preference as to the type of entertainment you wish to consume, but it is another to diss and deprecate the local entertainment industry altogether. 

We are a generation that grew up watching local television shows - be it kids central, okto, channel 8, suria whatever. We are lucky enough to experience development in technology allowing us to access netflix, amazon prime and youtube. But didn't this freedom in choice come with age and exposure to technology? Aren't the young children today still doing the same? Don't we hope that they have the same, wonderful memories and childhood that we all did? 

Another point would be the local entertainment industry, as with traditional media everywhere, is struggling to retain viewership as it is. If we don't respect our local entertainment industry enough to at least leave it alone when it doesn't align with our preferences, who will? If we don't support fellow Singaporeans, who will? 

Last point I promise. There is still much value in ""tacky"" television dramas. For the older folk who continue to draw much joy from them, these programmes are necessary for them to first, keep up with the times and second, understand the pioneer/merdeka generation stuff/CPF stuff etc. Young people claim that the older generation doesn't understand them - think mental health issues, modern day stresses. What if these are woven into the television programmes? what if they help your extended family become less judgmental during family gatherings for example - Would you still say the same about it? 

Not everything is about you, or even your generation. Just because you and your peers or even family don't take to it, doesn't justify your going around despising local entertainment. "

Hi OP, like you, I have also dealt with local grads, either through interview or interacting with some at work. While I agree that balancing a full time job and studying part time is akin to the stress of taking 5 modules per semester while balancing CCA's, it certainly does not justify the lower standards of BTech.

And yes, I was from BTech.

If you actually try to take a look at some of the midterm and exam papers, you would find that the standards of the questions were largely watered down. If you were to compare BEng and BTech papers, the difficulty standards are very very different. There is also the learning standards whereby for BTech, the profs are usually more lenient, in the sense that you can see students presenting horrible slides full of words and off the main topic, submitting horrible reports (copy paste from Wikipedia with no citation without removing the inline citations), even answering 1 out of 4 questions in the final exam and yet they can still score a C. Frankly even I would admit that this is unfair to full time students.

That being said, I have met fresh NUS NTU grads that cannot tell me what Central Limit Theorem is nor can they illustrate volume vs linear expansion. I have also seen employees from BTech that submitted technical report that aside from them adding colorful fonts, it can be jolly well written by a technician.

tldr: 
- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi"

61556,"I have weird personality because of my strong individuality. It makes me look like I am from another planet. I am 21 but I have never date before, & definitely not any time soon... I am pretty much aloof and eccentric, sometimes cold, sometimes hot, and I have a strong desire for freedom that I am not willing to give up for anything else, if getting into a relationship means some kind of giving up freedom. I also have super logical thinking, at most I will be a little emotional at night. Maybe all these account that I naturally don't suits for a relationship.

One day my mum jokingly told me that I will never get married because of my weird personality. I know she was joking but deep in my heart I know that this may be a fact, that I may never get married.

Despite my weird personality, I think I am rather kind and understanding. I always try to handle any difficulties in silent (whenever possible). I am definitely not the type who will trouble others for my own problem.

I get unconditional love from my grandparents since young. (They are mainly the ones who took care of me until pretty much into adulthood and not my parents) Because of that, I hope that one day I have the chance of being a good parent/grandparent too, but the fact of my personality makes things seems impossible and that I cannot do anything to help.

Their perspective and attitude are vastly different from mine, and to me their negativity in viewing people as well as hypocrisy (appears to help people, but talks behind about why the people can't do it themself and how they themselves have always been able to deal with such things with their own ability) makes it hard for me to blend in.

This is opposite of my boyfriend's family where sometimes I feel their actions constitute what I call lacking in manners.

We have been in a serious relationship for 2.5years. However, the topic of having children has always been brought up leading to us having some heated discussions. She really wants to have a kid while I do not. She does not exactly have a reason for wanting them, stating that ""why must there be a reason for wanting them?""


In my case, I am extremely opposed to having kids as I really dislike them. I am sure that having them would result in making me very very unhappy in the subsequent future. Moreover, it is likely that we would not be that financially stable even after 5 years. I do not wish to bring the kid up in an environment where I know that he/she will not be able to live comfortably.


It is not a deal breaker for her not to have kids, but it is a deal breaker for me. I really do love her a lot and do not wish to leave her.

61531,"I'm curious what people think of having mid-terms before recess week as opposed to after it. My take is that mid-terms occurring on the two weeks after recess week puts a lot of stress on students to keep up with the new lectures whilst still studying for the mid-terms, because as well all know, no amount of time prep is enough when the exam is still looming.

Mid-terms before recess week --
Pros: recess week lets students catch up and revise current content, maybe allows them to read ahead if the lecturer releases lecture slides early. Recess week is more chill since exam doesn't happen directly after, so less pressure to spend it mugging. Lecturers/TAs also have more time to mark papers during recess week. The lessons after recess week don't have the ""exam feels"" whilst attending them, that is, if you even attend them at all. Rewards students who are more consistent in the first half instead of cramming days before the exam. In my experience here, the content in the first half of the semester is usually easier than the second half, so easier to study for it.

Cons: Less study time before mid-terms for students. Forces students to keep up with the lesson from the start of the semester (can be seen as a pro depending on who you ask), probably resulting in lower mid-term scores on average. The module prep before semester starts likely more stressful since mid-terms occurs earlier, with no recess week ""buffer"".

Mid-terms after recess week --
Pros: More time to study, resulting in higher average scores. Allows students to catch up if they've been falling behind. Gives lecturers/TAs more time to set the mid-term papers.

Cons: Lecture attendance usually very low in week 7 and 8, causes snowballing for some students, especially those mods with 2 lectures a week. Less time to mark paper (more stress for lecturers/TAs). Recess week is a slog where you're pressured to study everyday for moar marks.

I believe NUS used to have mid-terms before recess week, before student complaints changed it to the current system (I believe the same happened to the SU system). I'm wondering if more people feel the same as I do, and prefer mid-terms to be before recess week."

61516,"Good evening to all. I'm the OP for #61516. 

For the past few days I had read through the various replies towards my post about BTech and I'm heartened to receive mostly positive reactions. But I believe there are a few points raised by various comments I should address.

But before I begin, please, please, type ""btech"" into the search bar and look at the all past post about btech. You would understand that there are students out there who do feel inferior, when compared to a BEng student. There are students who are lost, wondering whether to take up BTech. Remember that my post wasn't explicitly meant to glorify BTech. My post was to give an insight from an employer's POV and to motivate, albeit with a little bit of comparison between BTech and BEng. Because as I've mentioned, that post was triggered over a conversation that I overheard.

Some of you take it to challenge my POV and I welcome that. I have over 17 years of experience since I graduated from BEng and my POV is going to be a very direct one, from an ex-employee into an employer's POV.

Employers do not care how much hard work you put into to land yourself into NUS/NTU/govt universities.
Employers do not care how much you suffered while you are in school. Employers do not care how stress you were when you are taking 5 modules along with CCAs.
Employers do not care about the personal history and emotional baggage of all prospective interviewees and how they fought for placings.
Employers certainly do not care about your jealousy towards a particular individual who f*cked around during his younger days and managed to secure himself in BTech while you slog your life away in BEng, with a 5.0 GPA.

Remember, every hiring manager (probably) was an undergraduate once. We know the hardship. You are NOT special. We do not know you. You do not deserve our emotional attention on why you are more worthy just because you think you worked very hard for it.

Lets be practical. My company is like a bleeding wound. I need someone who can stop the bleed. Your hard work securing that 5.0 GPA and your water canoe (sorry for using you an example) CCA isn't going to help me with that.

Every year I have hundreds of students who apply for jobs. All highlighting about their GPAs and their merit achievements. Fair enough, that is all they have to showcase about themselves. Having those positive points in your resume only tells me 2 things. You are able to multi-task between school and other activities, and you did your homework before taking your exam.

When I hire an undergraduate, I expect them to think like an undergraduate. When I hire a graduate, I expect them to think like a graduate. When I hire a diploma graduate, I expect them to think like a diploma graduate. That is, you know your stuffs. Besides your theoretical knowledge on the subject, you have nothing to bring to the table to scale my company's business higher. With that piece of paper, you enter the workforce as a blank piece of paper and you go around demanding high pay while having sub-par knowledge and/or experience. Employers do not appreciate that. We need talents. We have budget. Sense of self-entitlement no? Elitist thinking that you are better just because you're from BEng?

Getting a degree is like a rite of passage for most of us. But it is a very carefully considered decision for full time working adults. Especially for long haul courses like BTech, where I'm aware that class sizes shrinks up to 50% to 60% from first year towards the last.

I do not doubt the quality that BEng offers. I certainly agree that BTech's curriculum stringency is watered down. To say that BTech students in general only want to pass is true as well. Which was precisely why I said the truth lies in the students themselves.

You can offer an incredibly quality content rich course like BEng. When you have students who graduated with flying colours, yet unable to perform their task as expected, it's a fail. You can offer a watered down BTech course. When you have student's who's goal is to pass and forget, is also a fail.

Like what one of our fellow OP said,

- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi


They're equally true. Whether they can bring the required knowledge and skills to the table, it's entirely up to them. To outright say that BEng is more superior than BTech is misleading. Likewise to say that BTech is inferior compared to BEng. 

At the end of the day, whoever can contribute most to the company, is favored most. (Copy, Paste)Employers looks for more than paper qualifications. The character, knowledge and skills that a BTech student presents, is worth more than a fresh graduate's first class hons. 5 years down the road, whoever can offer more of their skills and knowledge, whoever can display more achievements, goes to better places, be it a BEng or a BTech.


And for god's sake, can you students please stop with all these sexual dramas in school. Is that why my applicants mostly fail because they're more concern about having sex than actually studying. It is even more happening than K dramas.

Peace."

61514,"I dated a depressed guy once. No offence, but I've known anyone more self-centered than this person. Repect to everyone going to a hard time in life, I have absolutely no right to talk about mental health when I havent been there myself. But let me just say, I cant wrap around my head that this depressed person not only wants me to get them out of their shit-hole but also say I'm the reason for them to be blamed. Its such a hard thing to go through when all your efforts to help them just make me look like a loser ultimately. Why love and destroy another person's feelings when you can just be mindful towrds the other person right?"
61513,"With the recent posts about partners reconsidering if they should dump the other loved one due to them being not 'perfect' or 'ideal', I am really worried if my future partner would dump me as I have breast asymmetry that is quite serious and also a scar on my body due to a previous surgery. Would he dump me after I tell him about it since I don't have the ideal body type that most guys would look for?"

To me who cares about my families a lot and also genuinely hankers after true love, i really have no idea how to find a way out. Maybe someone here can enlighten me? "
61511,"@ #61511 The lowest set of grades I know of that still made dean's list are around {A+, A, A, A, A-}.  Of course, this is only based on what I know from personal/friends' experiences. There might have been lower grades admitted, but I doubt they'll be far from that which I've mentioned. 

That being said, I personally don't think it's always helpful to bank on a specific set of grades when it comes to percentile-based criteria (which the dean's list is based on), though hopefully this information will help with managing expectations. All the best! "
61509,"Hello I am the OP of #61474. I read the comments below and I just want to clarify that I did not know that I am in a pseudo-relationship until 3 months in. Basically I dated him, like go out every week, we even went overseas once together. I told my friends about him and they said he looks very honest and congratulated me for my new-found relationship. So I thought I was in a relationship, everyone around me thought that I am in a relationship. Because when we go out together we would also hold hands and take photos together. Until one of my colleague told me to go and clarify with him our status, then he said that we are just dating and not bfgf. And also I saw that he refused to delete the dating app and still uses it to talk to other girls. I felt duped and I don't know why I am being caught up in this situation. I saw some comments below saying I am loose... and I feel so sad. :("
61508,"Talking about health and relationships, is it normal for me not to want a relationship because I have health issues? I know of this guy who likes me and I like him too, however, I am unable to see myself in a relationship because I have poor health (and he knows it too)."
61507,"Many years ago, I just ended a relationship and started using dating apps out of curiosity. I met a guy who said that he was using it out of curiosity too. He had quite a plain profile, only one photo, nice scenery, him wearing tshirt, jacket and pants, his face slightly nerdy but good looking. 

He was a fresh grad with a reputable job and high pay and dreamed of building a start-up after saving up money. But he was humble, friendly and enthusiastic about the topics we discussed. 

Out of boredom, I asked if he wanted to meet up one day. After dinner at a mall, we spent hours talking at a nearby park. We hit it off and continued to talk after the meetup. 

One day I confessed to him that I was attracted to him when I saw him and he said he was also attracted to me. Maybe I was too lonely and horny, I asked him if he would like to be fwb and he agreed. 

Whenever I felt like hooking up, I would call him and he would travel all the way from the west to the east to find me. Every time he comes over, we would do the deed first and then spend hours cuddling and chatting until both of us fall asleep. He would hug me when he sleep until I wake him up for work in the morning. 

I always thought he was a fkboy and eventually I started dating someone and decided to cut off contact with him. However, he would try to reach out to me from time to time but I would ignore him. Then he stopped trying.

A few years later, we are both single and he just started his own business and we happened to bump into each other somewhere near my workplace. We had a nice chat over coffee. He asked me out for dinner that day and we chatted for hours. He was attentive and encouraging as I ranted to him about my struggles at work. At the end of the outing, he walked me to the lift and sent me a goodnight text when he reach home. 

A few days later, he asked me out and again we had a nice long chat. For the following days, he would text me every morning and throughout the day. I realised that I still had feelings for him after all these time. I felt really miserable because I assumed that maybe he wants to hook up just like last time.

So I told him I'm not interested in hanging out with him. To my surprise, he was very upset and kept asking me if he has done anything wrong during the past few days. He even confessed to me that he really likes me and he had feelings for me many years ago and even now. 

I find it really hard to believe him because he is such a good catch and I am such an ordinary person. And we had such a weird friendship to begin with. He spent hours trying to convince me not to give up on him and to give him a chance to date him but I insisted that we are very different people.

I really don't know what to do now. I felt like maybe he just wants to hook up and I also felt like we won't have a future because he just started his business and he mentioned that his priority is his business so he wouldn't want to settle down in the near future. Or maybe him saying his business is priority is actually just an excuse. I don't know what to feel now... "
61505,Hi there. Any kind souls would want to accept 2 person for CN4123R Chemical Engineering Design Project? Reason being got ditched by original teammates last minute.
61504,Lost & found on bus A2 April 13 7.30pm. Vanessa Lin please drop a comment and I will contact you.
61502,"I managed to gather whatever courage I have in me to confess to a friend that I have been crushing on since orientation. The result? A cold rejection. The reason? That I am fat and thus undesirable. And I have been told to hit the gym to change the way I look. But I have been wondering, what cant I be liked for who I am? Whenever my female friends get rejected/broke up because of their fun size, they got mad and demand to be accepted for who they are. What kind of sorcery is this?"
61501,"#61472 Also, things will get better only if you want to. There's limited things that you can do for him. Ultimately, the choice is his. For now, don't leave him alone okay?"

Thank you for being being there for your friend.
I'm relieved to see that there are still people who cares for someone who has that illness. 
Your friend may be having difficulties to talk about it openly with his psychologist and counselor. Maybe, he is not comfortable with them and he does not like opening up to them. Perhaps, he does not want to go through the hassle of having to undergo treatments and medications. Maybe, he feels ashamed that he is not getting any better and it does not help that his parents are not rendering him any emotional support or any support that he needs. 
On your part, stick by him and try your best to persuade him to talk to his psychs and counselor. But please be patient, okay? While i know that you're having a hard time to talk to him, know that he's having it harder too. It is not easy for him to open up. In the meantime, gather the things that he have said to you and look out for him for any signs of suicidal thoughts. Try to explore his feelings and thoughts and help him discover healthy ways to express himself. The thing about someone who has depression, they can be smiling and laughing to your face, but that's really just the outer surface. For we are like the icebergs, we show people what we want people to know but inside of us, it's a different thing going on.
It seems like you're the only one he's got? Thus, he really needs you. It would be easier if his parents had accepted his condition and give him support, but sadly, it's not like that. 
I'm pretty sure he does not want to have severe depression either. 
If he exhibits signs of suicidal ideations, please don't turn your back on him and make his parents aware of it too. 
Anyway, i support the 1st person who suggested that your friend write it out. :) 
For the person who commented ""Call police to send him to IMH"", that's not what you do first. It will not help him by doing that. 
In this world where you can be anything, be empathetic. If you were not able to relate to their feelings, then be kind and understanding. 
Do not judge what you don't understand. 
People with mental illness do not want to have it also. It's beyond their control. So, people, please show some support? They need it the most.
I will end my long post by wishing you and your friend the best, okay? Things will get better. It may not be so soon, but it can eventually.
Sending love to you!
