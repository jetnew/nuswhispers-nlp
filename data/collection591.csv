People think I’m gay just because I’ve no desire to have a girlfriend, get married, and have children. Why the stereotype? I’m just a metro-sexual urban male who enjoys the city life, money, and personal freedom. I dislike responsibilities. I love myself. I prefer living the high life, clubbing on weekends, eating fine dining, driving a nice car, travelling, and enjoying life."

59186,"My girlfriend and I have been together for quite some time now, but recently I found out that she was cheating on me.
The reason I found out that out is when I checked her phone and her chat history, and found out that she was cheating on me the whole time. There were kinky messages, some saying “I miss your d**k inside of me” and some “I miss giving you bl**j**s”. When I first saw those messages my mind just went blank, trying to absorb all that happened. I tried to stay calm the whole time when she was with me to reduce suspicion. It felt like shit and I went crazy. I wanted to confront her about it, but at the same time I couldn’t as I didn’t have any evidence other than me checking her phone.
Over the next few weeks, I observed slowly and continued checking her phone from time to time and eventually found out the pattern.  Whenever she said she reached home, she was actually checked in to a hotel with the guy. It seems as well the guy knows whenever I was with her, and would not message her at that time. Sometimes when the guy buys her stuff, she would show them to me and said that it was given by a friend when I already know who it was given by
I know it was my mistake for checking her phone, but I feel that if I hadn’t I wouldn’t have found out all these that was happening behind my back. She did not show any signs that she was cheating on me, so I can’t use that reason to start the topic. Is either she was really good at hiding it, or she was just making use of me as she couldn’t be together with the guy. If I act rashly, it’ll just affect the whole relationship and make it seem like I was the one at fault when the relationship breaks.
I really don’t know what to do with this. One side of me is telling me to break up with her, another side of me is telling me to continue trusting her and she knows what she is doing. If I didn’t check her phone, I would never have known that she was cheating on me and we will still continue to be a lovely couple
Anyone has any advice for me to continue on with the relationship? Or I should just confess and break up with her?

59185,"I finally understand why are there more and more otaku. 

Women always blame men for not being able to ""handle"" successful women. They are merely thinking from the perspective of one gender and often forget that a very large majority of these women are extremely self-righteous?  Just look at some of the single profs and lecturers, won't you go ""walao, this kind of 变态 no wonder still single""? While that women are more and more educated and self-sufficient, it's quite forgotten that the opposite is also correct? 

Forgive me if I am wrong but I don't think the society  moves positively for only one gender. That being said, a guy receiving a decent, lets say, 5k pay wouldn't want to put up for a woman who is ""always right""? If the man just wants sex, cheap club girls, prostitutes or even blow-up dolls are just fine?? Why would he want to put up with someone who is always going to out-argue him, lecture him, etc for life?

59179,"Whenever I request to take leave, sometimes my boss will reply ok. And sometimes he will not reply at all. What does this mean? He is unhappy that I take leave? Or he don't want me to take leave? This is stressing me out whenever I don't get his response. "
59178,"‘If you leave me, I will kill myself’.

It took me some time to gather my thoughts to write this, as I didn’t want to be reminded of the painfully traumatic experience that I had to go through. I’m writing this to raise awareness for those who might be trapped in an emotionally abusive relationship yet have no idea what to do, because I was once in that position. 

My ex-boyfriend (let’s call him X) used to threaten suicide whenever he wanted his way in things. He wouldn’t let me hang out with my friends or pursue by own interests (like travelling). We had our own personal differences and didn’t seem like we would be able to work out in the future. Whenever I raised a breakup, X told me he would kill himself if I did break up with him. He resorted to sending me photographs of him at the rooftops of buildings attempting to jump, and him slitting his wrists. Every time this happened, I would apologise to him, relent and stay in the relationship because I was so afraid he would really take his life or harm himself further. This went back and forth a few months and it took a mental and emotional toll on me. Of course, I am not undermining the fact that X could have been struggling with mental health issues (depression and being suicidal etc), and I did encourage him to seek help if he needed professional help. He dismissed these claims and insisted he was mentally sound and would kill himself simply because he couldn’t bear the thought of me leaving him. I was very afraid to tell my family and friends, and I spent nights breaking down, wishing I didn’t have to go through his multiple threats time and time again. 
Eventually, my closest friends found out when they overheard my phone conversation with him, begging him not to jump. I was freaking out and that was when I spilled everything to my friends and they pointed out that X was being unhealthy, manipulative and controlling. 

In the end, after much thought, I did break up with him as it was far too draining for me to bear. I reasoned with X that this unhealthy relationship was making us both unhappy, and perhaps what we really needed was a time off from each other. He agreed, and we parted ways. The stress from the whole ordeal was overwhelming so after we broke up, I sought help from a therapist and she shared with me some advice on what I could and should have done.

1.	Call a support hotline to seek help for the person involved (e.g. Samaritans of Singapore)
2.	Speak to someone you trust about your partner’s death threats
3.	Remember that you are not responsible for your partner’s choices

I’m sharing this story because so many people I know (regardless of gender) have been once put in such a helpless and terrifying position because of their partner. Physical abuse is easier to pick up, but emotional abuse isn’t. Having your partner force and manipulate you into staying in a relationship is definitely a form of emotional abuse. If you’re going through something like that, you can try reasoning with your partner and learn why your partner is acting this way. If this persists, don’t be afraid to speak up and seek help! YOU DESERVE TO BE LOVED!!

p.s. There are suicidal people who are battling with mental health issues and I am not advocating for you to leave your partner/friend who has depression. Instead, learn to discern the difference between someone who is using emotional and manipulative abuse to get his/her way and someone who really needs professional help. I really hope this post helps someone identify the red flags in their relationship and raise awareness on emotional abuse in relationships!

59163,"Continuing from my own OP #59126...
Thank you so much for some of your own opinions, and I have taken note on some relevant advice. However, I forgot to point out that by WA 'online' status, it means after work hours. Logically, can work matters be settled offline, given that you need a computer system to accomplish it? (i.e my partner works in a hospital). Also, I know personal space is important, and my partner has his own circle of friends to chat with etc...but as partners, shouldn't you prioritize what is more important (besides work matters)? So friends over r/s? Then I'd rather just us staying as friends so we get to text more? I also didn't mention that we are only meeting up once every week...and I feel that our meet ups might be even lesser. I also do know that work can be tiring etc...but shouldn't texting your partners make you feel relaxed, happy and stress-free? If you put yourself in my shoes, how would you feel if I don't hear from my partner after a long day of work? but just a few mere texts and replies that come 2-4 hours later? Would this r/s even sustain at this rate?"

59151,"My gf and I recently just started having sex. Something is frustrating me. Since I have no prior experience and she is my first, I hope to seek opinions from everyone. 

Whenever we have sex, she will just lie there and I’ll be the one doing all the work. Even when she is on top of me (riding), she will lie onto me and I have to be the one ramming upwards. 

It’s so frustrating when the other party is not putting in any effort. It’s so different from what I watched on porn. I mean I understand porn is exaggerated to some point and I can’t compare to it, but is this too much?

Some of my friends say if a girl don’t put in effort during sex, it shows she is a self centered person, is that true? 

I haven’t talk to her about it because I want to seek opinions from all of you first. If it’s normal, maybe I won’t bring it up to her. If not, I will raise the issue to her. 

Thanks! (No troll comment please). "

The meal was $14. Both of us are used to treating each other meals so the amount doesn't matter.

59140,"Food for thought:
Has anyone thought about how humans are going against nature? By that i mean natural selection - survive to find a mate, and to reproduce.
In nature, we see that organisms that cannot find a mate eventually does not reproduce, and their bad genes are therefore not passed down the species evolutionary line. 
However, what modern humans are doing now is just defying that. 
Putting on braces, getting plastic surgery. These are some examples as to how human beautify ourselves so that we can look more attractive to find mates. All the ugly genes continue to get passed down and makes us human evolve much slower. 
Furthermore, we use products such as glasses, contact lenses. Without them, i doubt people with eye defects can survive long enough to find mates as well."

I went through severe depression last year, after which I sprang back to become the best, strongest, and most confident version of myself today. Given this contrast from last year, I should be fulfilled with who I am today, as I’ve definitely come a long way.

59124,"May I ask whether what I see every day (crazy rich peers,I’m not even exaggerating or joking???!) is the “norm”among nus students? 

How do so many girls from nus manage to go for shopping “sprees”and “hauls” where they just...buy large amounts of things in one trip? It’s sheer amazing. They can just walk in to Zara, Forever 21, H&M and walk out with so many Shopping bags filled??? 

They can afford shopping trips like this, where I can clearly see that $100-$300 has been spent in one shot. Not over one month. $100-$300 IN JUST ONE DAY. Sometimes they even manage to include a nice manicure and a haircut, and one pampering session alone could total $100 plus IN JUST ONE DAY. So total damage is $500( yes, really) in a day. 

I have never been to Bangkok so far, but I see my friends buying so much until the whole bed or the whole table is like FILLED TO THE BRIM with clothes. Really..is that the norm everyone is able to afford?  How does an average undergraduate or fresh grad even possess this kind of insane financial ability to buy THIS MUCH in ONE day? 

Yes, I know Bangkok stuff are cheap. But you all buy so much until your whole bed is FULL then don’t they add up to a lot too? 

Is it normal for just an average (I’m not even talking about rich or crazy rich) and normal person from age 19-23 to......spend $100-$300 in one day? What kind of mad rich shopping trips are people around me embarking on? 

How much do you spend per spree? Is $100-$300 like damn a lot? 

Me? I’m not rich, I’m not very very poor either. (I think I’m not considered as super poor. I don’t buy from Zara or Topshop, I don’t even have a branded bag(mine costs cheaper than $50, trust me). I never do my nails or dye my hair before. I even cut my hair at cheap places like snip Avenue. I don’t even have a single shopping spree where I spend over $30?

I've known a guy for a year. We always hang out with our group of friends. I find him interesting funny, and kind. I've never thought of him more than a friend. I don't think he was ever interested in me too.

Recently, our group stopped hanging out and I really miss this guy. Sometimes before I sleep, i keep on thinking about going on dates with him. I even have sexual thoughts about him. 

This is really weird because I'm quite tall and he is really short. We are like 10 m apart. And he's a bit fat and most people would say he's ugly. Also, he's Indian and I'm Chinese. Everything about this is wrong but I'm still romantically and sexually attracted to him.

I'm scared that if him and I are together, my friends will think that I'm weird. I would be constantly embarrassed walking around with a ""ugly"" short Indian guy and my friends will talk shit behind my back.

This is my fifth month working here, I took up the offer because of my family circumstances, and the job market is really bad, although I was there during my FYP, knowing how bad the place is. 

Just when I started to work, a staff left his position urgently and I was forced to take up his responsibilities on top of my own. I had been too nice for everyone that they took it for granted, and started to blame me things. When I did not get the respect from them, it affected my work performance.

Today, one of the senior staff blamed me for a few things, I finally fought back with some of my thoughts (and of course something that is not so polite haha)

Just want to share a really nice article (link at the end) that I came across right after that fight. It says 'Work defines us as people i.e. when we aren't happy at work, other areas of our life suffer. ' It really change my mind about the meaning of getting a job. 

Maybe all the time we are too realistic towards a job, about the salary, recognition from superior, career prospect and how other judge you on your career success, that we lost the things that we wanted to pursue. 

Let's stop judging on others' and our own job, so that we can find out the real happiness in our job.
