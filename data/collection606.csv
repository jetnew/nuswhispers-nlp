60696,"Follow up to #60649, thanks for the advice, I saw A again today but I think he took the hint and avoided me. So I guess I'm grateful for the consideration here and I guess there's no longer much of an issue.

I've thought it over and decided that it would be good to talk to my bf about it, and so I'll be doing that and we'll see how things go.

While I can understand that you don't want to know anyone else that's had sex with your partner, I don't think that it's reasonable not to even talk about sex at all and flip out whenever it comes up. I mean anytime it comes up, not even talking about our pasts.

I can't even tell him that he's terrible in bed and that I never actually get to finish because he's so aggressive against the topic."
60695,"I will be entering FASS soon, but I have not made up my mind with regards to which particular major I want to pursue. The ones that I am considering right now are Economics, Psychology, Communications and New Media, as well as Geography. 

Economics is the one I was initially leaning towards the most, as I developed great interest in it ever since picking it up in JC. The concepts, theories, and general essay writing were all relatively easy for me to grasp and I was able to consistently do well in JC. However, I have read about how Economics in Uni places much more emphasis on the mathematical / statistics aspect of things, which worries me as Math has always been one of my weakest subjects since young. 

With regards to Psychology, I've also found out that many people blindly dive into pursuing this major without truly understanding what it entails. Yet, my current impression of Psychology still places it as one of the top few majors that I have interest in. Many also claim that a Psychology degree on its own is useless, as Psychology is a case of ""Do the Masters, or don't do it at all'. Could anyone kindly explain this statement?

I am still in the process of finding out more information about CNM and Geography, so any advice or feedback from both current and graduated students are welcome and will be appreciated!

60691,"Reply to #60652

An individual will naturally have bias for or against a particular issue due to one’s upbringing and socialisation, which starts the moment you’re born. What’s important I feel is to analyse both sides of the argument. It is supposed to challenge your ""common sense"".

Perhaps these claims you mentioned are more of these individuals speaking from lived experiences? They play a part in forming one’s perceptions. It could also be stereotypes or dominant discourse. It may not necessarily be the ""truth"" but the fact that they exist must reflect the situation in a particular segment of society. But then again, there's no such thing as a definite ""truth"" or ""reality"". Of course proper research would have to be done if you’re writing a research paper but when you’re doing in-class discussions and seminars, I would think lived experiences are the more readily accessible area of knowledge.

Higher barriers to entry? Perhaps it is the pessimist/conspiracy theorist in me but that’s highly unlikely. As mentioned by another, FASS in general dabbles in issues that can be subversive. Making the entry barriers higher may send the message that it is a desirable course. More people will want to pursue it and more may even end up starting to question the establishment. Probably not what any state would want. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s one of the reason why the arts and humanities are not provided funding as high as those of STEM.

60676,"OP of #46692 here. For those who are lazy to click, here's what I posted last time:

""Had a secondary school gathering the other day met the girl who was my first love. After the gathering we shared a cab home since we live around the same area. 

The short 20 min ride was an emotional rollercoaster (no pun intended) for me. It reminded me of the reason why I was completely attracted to her back then. At the same time it reminded me of why we didn't, and would never have worked out.

We're still on talking terms and in fact is planning for a trip for this group of secondary school friends at the end of the year. But I guess that bittersweet feeling I get when I'm around her would never go away. ""

During the trip, there was this moment when two of us were alone. Somehow the conversation topic came to our past relationship, how we got together, how we broke up etc. It was then I asked : 

""Would we have worked out if both of us were more mature?""

She didn't reply at the moment. And I decided not to pursue the topic.

At the end of the trip we shared a cab home from the airport again since we live in the same area. We didn't talk much during the ride. Just when she's about to alight she said: 

""I guess we'll never know unless we try.""

Fast forward a couple of months to today: We are happily attached and the appears to be going strong.  Idk how far we'll go this time. I'm just grateful that we're given a second chance. I'll treasure this and hopefully take her down the aisle this time. 

For all those troubled by love out there: Not everyone will get a second chance like us. If you really love your other half, treasure them. "
60674,"I'm a relatively fresh NUS graduate, just wanted to ask what's the opinion on dating an intern at the workplace?

Just to give some context (and keeping it deliberately vague for obvious reasons), my company hires interns from NUS on quite a frequent basis. In all honestly, I wasn't really looking for anything, and in fact I treat most of them as friends only. However, there's this particular intern who slowly grew on me; maybe it's because of common topics as we had the same major, or just her friendly demeanor, or that she's super capable, or that she looks so cute when she smiles, idk. Anyway I feel like I'm falling for her bit by bit. Biggest problem is that I don't know if it's even appropriate, and I don't want to be seen as the creep/fucboi who preys on interns, though our age gap isn't that big (I'm still a fresh grad after all). Somehow I get this guilty conscience / conflict of interest feeling as after all, I am still sort of her ""superior"", and I don't want any misunderstanding to arise from all this.

Am still trying to stay as detached as I can so I don't crash too badly if things don't work out, but does anyone have any advice? Or perhaps used to be in the same situation?

60673,"Hi guys I need some advice.

I have recently graduated last year (overloaded to grad 1 sem early), with a second upper in comms, and now am working with a friend on a startup earning about 2K a month. I know it's very little considering what I can earn outside doing a 9-5 desk job, but I am passionate about the business, and don't mind the long working hours hustling to grow it.

I'm in a dilemma right now, and am very very stressed out because of the pressure from my parents who are expecting me to earn 3K+ and collecting CPF with my degree. As the company is still very small, it is unable to pay me what outside companies can offer, but should it grow, I know I will definitely be the first to be given my dues, considering I'm part of the founding team (aka as the company earns more, I will get paid more).

The dilemma is then, should I take the conventional, safe route of graduating > getting a comfortable 9-5 job which I might not enjoy as much as what I'm doing now, OR should I chase my dreams and take the high risk/high reward, unconventional route of entrepreneurship and continue grinding at the company?

As with most entrepreneurial journeys/startups, success is not certain and I'm aware of that, hence r'now I'm in a limbo of whether it is worth it to take the leap of faith and try to see if it works out, or just go and start finding a job pronto and not waste anymore time. I'm a female, 23 this year, if that matters. Some of you guys' insights would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you"
60671,"#60610 here

Hey Prof Ben, sorry if it came across that way but I didn't mean to say you were elitist and I probably should have phrased it differently. Didn't mean to be rude or anything. I think it's that you remind us regularly that the job market as of today is still quite elitist in nature (at least for first jobs) and the motivations behind it, when many profs in my course (I'm not in CS but in a fluffier subject) like to downplay its importance which is a real source of frustration. This is especially ironic when they always say they will use the bell curve. It's always the essays which I've struggled with scoring, the mods where it's a set answer I've done much better. You know I wish my profs would release the solutions so I knew where I went wrong, but that hasn't happened.

Again, I hope you understand from the post that I actually agree with the fact that you say what needs to be said and treat us like young adults instead of kids which need coddling. University should be a time where students grow up, maybe you could say grades are not the only thing and there are other things which matter true, but downplaying it's importance just to make students feel better doesn't fix anything. Going to a consult only to hear that the score doesn't suck doesn't fix anything. A spade is a spade. When you ask, what you want to know is what you missed and what was expected which led to your score so that you don't suck the next time, that's way more important.

I didn't expect such a long response tbh, but I've read it and this sincere piece of advice, I'll take it. I generally agree with most of what you said, but I do have this to say, I think everyone compares upwards generally because that's where we want to end up to be answerable to ourselves and our loved ones. Knowing yourself to be fortunate is one thing, but using that as an excuse to lose one's drive and cave into self-consolation gets us nowhere. There are many kids who want to get into uni but don't on their first try, but they don't just take that no for an answer. They strive and work hard in what they do, eager to prove themselves, some of them coming in as mature candidates while others work their way up into their careers to prove that they've got what it takes to succeed. That's what we should be inspiring, instead of saying because you're in nus you're exceptional because you're the best. Frankly, this sort of behaviour not only reinforces societal stereotypes against non-uni kids, but can make those in uni develop complacency and a sense of entitlement. 

Lastly, I think your idea of pushing for mastery over a one time test is really ambitious, and even though I may not directly benefit from this change since I'm not in CS, I wish you and your team all the best in getting these tough but necessary reforms passed and hope it catches on across the entire university. It's exciting to have such a deep exchange of views, and I hope there aren't any hard feelings and I sincerely apologise if there was anything I said that was personally offensive in any way, but I'll be blunt this talk about 'exceptional because you're here' needs to stop."

I bravely took my food and just sit down with him and we ate together. The other time is that I am always early for class so I would chill at this spot before class start. One morning I went to the place and I saw him.

60654,"I have a suggestion for the bus service, I don't know where to send the suggestion but I'm also lazy to find out and I know that the NUSSU people read NUSWhispers. 

Anyway, if the algorithm isn't already implementing this, I suggest that a new system could take in the timetable of all the students and generate the number of specific bus route needed for each timing. For example, If there are many students with lecture transiting from FOS to CLB at 12 pm, perhaps, the system could send more bus that caters to these students plus minus 30 minutes such as sending more bus A1 (I don't know if its the right bus) from 11.30 am to 12.30 pm. I think that the routes are quite simple within NUS and therefore, I don't think that it is an unreasonable request for the bus drivers to be familiarized with all the routes and to change multiple routes throughout the day. They just have to follow a platform that tells them which route to drive at which timing etc. 

If the current system is already taking this into account then just take it that I am talking nonsense. I'm just a lazy student and don't really feel like digging out the current system of the buses. 

To those who are intending to comment things like ""This is not the right place to suggest"" or something along the line. Honestly, I don't take the bus and I don't really need a revamp in the system, I just feel that many people are complaining and therefore, suggesting some ideas for the welfare of NUS peeps in general.

Now, he at least has a fighting chance to secure a local uni placing, something which remains as a dream for many others. 

He told me his journey was tough. Most common criticism he received was why devote so much of his life in education,when he should just move on in other aspects of life like working and find himself a girlfriend to settle down.

He says that major aspects of life like settling down is destiny and forcing oneself to settle down will bring nothing but disaster. Also,because he only had an A level cert, he could not find a job with proper prospect as well. Hence, his decision to go poly.

As a nus student myself, i appreciate how hard is it to secure a local uni placing in Sg. Hence,by  looking at his results, i really think his journey was worth it.

60642,"Honestly, I hope that whichever official NUS organisation is responsible for banning plastic straws will lift it. I as a plastic straw user do not force those who do not want to use metal straws or no straws at all to use them. Both drinking from a cut seal and paper straw is disgusting. Call me pampered if you like but the former generally results in some drink getting on the outside of the cup while the latter just adds a weird off-putting cardboard taste in your drink. Given such ""strong"" support from NUS to remove these straws I suggest bring them back and see how much usage has actually dropped from these forced measures. All this is doing is pissing off and converting previously neutral consumers. NUS wouldn't be the institution it is without the many thousands of students that study here and such changes which impact almost every single person could be done more democratically I feel?

3. Refer to point 2

4. LumiNUS' only problem used to be that it was slow. It's pretty much fixed now. What other features of IVLE do you think are lacking in LumiNUS apart from the 2 which can be fixed by you?

Even though you told several people about your feelings about me, neither of us acted upon those feelings because it didn't feel like the right thing to do. Several other dramas occurred as we went through university and I have thought you are a closed chapter to me. We have both dated other people and didn't have any direct contact for a long time. Until lately when fate pulled us together and you took the chance, which took me by surprise because I also thought you would have forgotten about me long ago. This time no one really stood between us but there is a continent and 14 hours of flight and 7 hours of time zone difference. It made me wonder why some people like us have to repeatedly cross path, only to realise again and again that it is not right. When will I finally learn that we are only good in theory but never did we have any chance to work, so that I won't work up all these feelings the next time I meet you halfway. It would take me awhile to let go of you (again) and move on with my life (again).

60616,"I was a user of GrabWheels to travel around NUS until the new implementation (thanks to those irresponsible e-scooter users spoiling the market) came up. Going for courses and still need to pay for the service, no thank you. At least my Porsche doesn’t need a helmet."
60615,"I'm the one who posted here the other day about asking my ex's friend working in the same office to send my regards to my ex. So what happened is this friend very eagerly said she'll let my ex know that I asked. However, now I still don't have any correspondence from my ex or this friend. Does this mean my ex really doesn't want to at least be cordial and acknowledge me?"
60614,Some mornings I just woke up feeling depressed and sad about my life for no particular reason. Then the whole days my mind will be heavy and blank. Any advice or if anyone has encountered the same.
60613,"It is week 10 already. I'm not quite sure how I'm still here? I'm really exhausted from the onslaught of work. Having spent many semesters in NUS, I am surprised that I am still not used to it. In fact, the dread seems to get worse each semester.

I know everyone else is tired too. I can see it in many of my groupmates' faces that they are struggling to keep up, to stay afloat and on top of the crazy whirlwind of schoolwork, projects, meetings, etc. Maybe I'm misreading but I can see a kind of blank despair and uncertainty in their eyes. 

How is there so much to do? Or rather, why is there so much to do? 

How much am I really learning if I'm just flipping through pages, eager to finish up this chapter so I can move on to the next, and the next and the next.... I can't even ponder deeply on the concepts being taught to me anymore. Does any of these even matter ultimately? How will this crazy workload help anyone in anyway? 

Am I going crazy or does anyone else feel this way?

Every time I feel like I'm going to drown in the never-ending pile of work, I google for this poem by William Henry Davies, called -

Leisure

What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.

A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.


Every time I finish reading it, I feel like crying. Because I have no time to stand and stare, and my life is just flying by. Every year comes by more quickly than the previous one, and months creep past without notice. Everyone is sprinting in all directions, towards their life goals - better grades, job promotions, internship opportunities, overseas exchange, more money, more branded goods, more holidays, - is it worth the chase? 

In the flurry of events and frenzied pace of life, I think I've lost myself."
60612,I recently got a long overdue catch up with an FASS friend who asked how was life in SoC. He was quite shocked to find out that the SoC profs are more hands-off and often students end up struggling when thrown into assignments that they know nothing about. Whereas I was surprised at how much hand holding the FASS profs did like provide all the resources they will need to do their projects. I always thought that uni = adult learning = teach bare minimum and find out the other 90% yourself one way or another. He also had no idea that the average CAP for SoC (3.5? Am I right?) is so much lower than that in FASS. I dont know what to make of this information. I remember feeling quite overwhelmed since I had no computing background and I still struggle until now but at least I know what to expect or rather what not to expect. I want to know if anyone else feels like this difference in teaching is good or can be improved? 
60611,"Hi again,

I posted #60611, and from the comments I think a lot of people have misinterpreted my reason for posting it. I was not looking for reassurance of my abilities. I was trying to find out if sexism and gender discrimination is a problem that many girls like myself face, or that I'm just unlucky. At the same time, I wanted to raise awareness of implicit gender bias. A lot of us think that we are not sexist. However, because we grew up in an environment where gender stereotypes were ""imprinted"" onto us, sometimes we subconsciously are. Now that we are aware that we might be unintentionally biased, we can make a conscious effort to correct/unlearn it. 

You are not good with kids ""for a guy"", just because traditionally women are the caretakers. You are good with kids, period. You are not a good engineer (or programmer, or mathematician, or scientist, etc) ""for a girl"". You are good regardless of your gender. Stereotypes are unhealthy for everyone. 

Lastly, to the girls in male-dominated fields who feel like you don't belong, feel like you're less competent, less qualified, or just /less/, I want to tell you that you are not. You earned your spot to be there, and you deserve to be there as much as everyone around you does. Don't let anyone tell you that you are only valued just because you are a girl (in a sea of guys), and don't let anyone judge you based on that. 

Thank you all once again for your time, and I hope we can work towards a more equitable society. "
60610,"#60610 here

Hey Prof Ben, sorry if it came across that way but I didn't mean to say you were elitist and I probably should have phrased it differently. Didn't mean to be rude or anything. I think it's that you remind us regularly that the job market as of today is still quite elitist in nature (at least for first jobs) and the motivations behind it, when many profs in my course (I'm not in CS but in a fluffier subject) like to downplay its importance which is a real source of frustration. This is especially ironic when they always say they will use the bell curve. It's always the essays which I've struggled with scoring, the mods where it's a set answer I've done much better. You know I wish my profs would release the solutions so I knew where I went wrong, but that hasn't happened.

Again, I hope you understand from the post that I actually agree with the fact that you say what needs to be said and treat us like young adults instead of kids which need coddling. University should be a time where students grow up, maybe you could say grades are not the only thing and there are other things which matter true, but downplaying it's importance just to make students feel better doesn't fix anything. Going to a consult only to hear that the score doesn't suck doesn't fix anything. A spade is a spade. When you ask, what you want to know is what you missed and what was expected which led to your score so that you don't suck the next time, that's way more important.

I didn't expect such a long response tbh, but I've read it and this sincere piece of advice, I'll take it. I generally agree with most of what you said, but I do have this to say, I think everyone compares upwards generally because that's where we want to end up to be answerable to ourselves and our loved ones. Knowing yourself to be fortunate is one thing, but using that as an excuse to lose one's drive and cave into self-consolation gets us nowhere. There are many kids who want to get into uni but don't on their first try, but they don't just take that no for an answer. They strive and work hard in what they do, eager to prove themselves, some of them coming in as mature candidates while others work their way up into their careers to prove that they've got what it takes to succeed. That's what we should be inspiring, instead of saying because you're in nus you're exceptional because you're the best. Frankly, this sort of behaviour not only reinforces societal stereotypes against non-uni kids, but can make those in uni develop complacency and a sense of entitlement. 

Lastly, I think your idea of pushing for mastery over a one time test is really ambitious, and even though I may not directly benefit from this change since I'm not in CS, I wish you and your team all the best in getting these tough but necessary reforms passed and hope it catches on across the entire university. It's exciting to have such a deep exchange of views, and I hope there aren't any hard feelings and I sincerely apologise if there was anything I said that was personally offensive in any way, but I'll be blunt this talk about 'exceptional because you're here' needs to stop."
60606,"Is it normal to feel bothered by those invigilators walking around you while you're doing your exams in the mpsh? I feel extremely uncomfortable in their presence, and honestly many times during the exams I had wanted stab them with my pen and tell them to go away."
60604,"Reply to #60604:
Free 4MCs? I would willingly have the school take away 4MCs away from the current credits I have completed just for a chance to join Orbital. And no, it is also not because I wish I could skip NOC interviews. 

Coming from a non-soc faculty, it is really difficult for someone like me to meet and learn from SOC students. It doesn't help that so many of my non-soc friends have literally given up on CS after / while taking CS1010. So to me, it's an incredible opportunity to network, gain experience, get feedback, and work with SOC students. I would definitely even consider crashing the seminars if I could actually get information on where they are held and at what time. So yes, there are still people out there who want to join orbital for the right reasons, not just for the free 4MCs as you suggested. 

I could probably (and am going to have to) learn everything by myself, but the way I see it, orbital is NOT overrated; its true value lies in allowing peers to come together to work on a project and learn from each other. But as you said, ""there is no room to blame the organizing committee"" and ""grow up"", and I completely agree. Just gotta go a different route and work on my own projects, on my own during the summer. 

Really hope the organizing committee considers increasing the quota for non-soc students in the future, so that students from other faculties will get the chance to work with soc students more.

Yea I fantasize about him and I having sex. I daydream about him everyday. Is there a way to stop myself from these excessive thoughts? I really need some genuine advice here"
