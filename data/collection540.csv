54099,"So I was purchasing drinks today, at one of NUS student's favourite stalls and I ask the auntie (whose identity I will protect) for a paper straw.. She looked around to check that the coast is clear, before sticking her hand into a dark corner under the counter to pull out a plastic straw!

She didn't blame me, but asked if I didn't receive the email about the straw ban. I said I did and it mentioned about paper straws. She seemed confused about how a paper straw will ever work as a straw..

Apparently, stall owners like us students, aren't given any notice about the impending (or immediate, rather) ban on straws. I chatted further with auntie and asked what if she had just topped up her supply of straws just before the email was sent out? She shrugged in defeat, ""what to do?"".

At a time when hawkers are being screwed by ""social enterprises"" with unfair contractual terms, our well-loved F&B vendors in NUS are being screwed over as well.. Will anyone carry out a buyout of all straws from our NUS beverage vendors so that they do not suffer unnecessary financial loss if they are expected to discard their plastic straws and procure paper straws (even though some would say they would have procured those straws anyway and are not required to lower prices)."
54097,"#54097: I too am diagnosed with a mental illness before entering uni and am on medications. I declared it and still got acceptance letters from more than one uni.

The doctors (for pre admission) know what is best and will decide accordingly so just be honest. They may send you for a specialist review and just be honest with them. They are trained and will use their professional judgement to see if your condition to enter uni (and recommend special arrangements if necessary). Just bear in mind that the doctors will be fair and only want the best for you. 

You may want to speak to a counsellor (in your Polytechnic) and share your concerns and I am sure they will give you their advice too. 

My advice is to be frank and not hide anything. It's better to declare it than to let the uni find out that you did not declare. 

All the best in your studies and I sincerely hope you will get into a uni course of your choice!"

I got below median by 10 marks for a 40%mid term. But still got an A later. Key is to change the studying technique u have used for mid term. You cant expect improvement if you repeat what you have done.

54089,"The iReject campaign has been going on for about a week now. I have tried hard to suppress my disagreement with the campaign due to the good underlying values it was trying to promote. However, from my personal experience, the aggregate value that the campaign is achieving seems to be less than the inconveniences and problems caused to the general student body. 

First as many on NUSWhispers have repeatedly lamented, the implementation of the campaign seems to be sorely lacking in proper planning. An email was sent out and the campaign was launched the following day. What then is the aim of the campaign? Is it merely a superficial act of stopping the usage of straws, or should the campaign be targeted at the larger problem of environmental conservation and changing our consumption habits. If it is the latter, where is the informative campaign that should accompany the initial launch. Overall the campaign feels like just another half-hearted attempt at appearing to care.

Secondly, there is no information disseminated by the campaign about the reason for promoting the alternatives of metal and paper straws. Has there been studies to show that metal and paper straws are better? The amount of energy needed to mine, refine and shape a metal straw may have the same carbon footprint as thousands of plastic straws. Paper straws on the hand, may face again the problem of either having a plastic lining or glues and wax used for waterproofing. This creates huge problems for recycling or reusing and may not actually be more environmentally friendly compared to plastic straws. I believe that as an institute of higher learning, we should question the pragmatism and impact of ideas we are propagating. 

The iReject campaign has caused many inconveniences for the student body, I believe that a campaign that the school runs on such scale must be backed up by facts and a proper plan of action. This is a call for all concerned individuals to join the telegram channel @strawfairiesSG as we seek to promote a constructive platform for discussion and search for answers.

54088,"Every little bit matters even a straw. 

But one of the biggest environment decision one can make is to go child free. Let me explain.

while singapore being a developed country use more resource per person compared to average, there is a saving grace!

Our birthrate is Low and continue to be Low. Which is great coz from environmental perspective. solve overpopulation.

When you have one less child, you are bringing one less plastic consuming, fossil fuel burning, meat eating human to the world and hence reduce the burden. 

Economically might not make sense but environmentally it certainly does. World population are nearing 8billion. Time to do our part to reduce our population. (Singapore birth rate is good evidence of our commitment to reducing global warming) As Long as domestic birth rate is below replacement rate, we are doing our part. 

To make up the population shortfall, immigration is the main pillar of population growth. 

So singapore is net negative humans production facility. By allowing immigration we are taking excess human capacity of other countries.

Think of humans as a resource grabbing unit, the less the merrier. 

Optimal world population is probably about 3 billion. 

conceptually we are doing right by compensating the hyper population growth of other countries. Our Low birthrate really helps

54083,"Can't believe people are still whining about this.  

How is everyone so upset over the removal of the straws?  Sorry you suffered a minor inconvenience on one day so that some wildlife doesn't end up suffocating.  The responses to (a very minor) change have shown exactly how entitled Singaporeans are.  We don't have time to ""slowly phase it out"" - we need to do things quickly.

Plastic cups should also be banned and replaced with bring your own cup (for those who want to take away) and borrowed cups (for those who stay).  We do that with cutlery, why not cups?

Stop complaining about people taking transport or generating other waste.  That only provides a reason to find a way to make these things sustainable or reduce their use.  It is irrelevant to the straws.  Any difference is better than nothing!

The world is dying and Singapore isn't going to do anything about it because ""I want to suck up my pearls"".  There won't be any pearls for you to suck up in 100 years.

Bottom line, I think you should set proper boundaries with him.

Yes, the waste in Singapore are indeed appropriately disposed at the landfill in Pulau Semakau. But guess what, thanks to the unprecedented amount of waste that we are generating, even with burning to reduce waste to ashes, the landfill will run out of space by 2035 (15 years earlier than expected). Then where shall we disposed our waste next? Cordone off another cluster of islands, drain out all the seawater, destroy the local marine life in the process, and go about our ""proper"" way of disposal? 

Yes, plastic straws take up minimal space in the landfill, but the rationale behind the entire movement is so that we, as university students, can take the lead in realising that we can forgo certain conveniences for the betterment of the environment. Think of the plastic bag that comes with the bubble tea drink that is promptly disposed right after the drink is finished or the plastic coffee stirrer that is used for merely 5 seconds, I think we can do much better.

54056,"Hi, anyone spotted a black coloured ""open and squeeze"" Puma bottle around engin E4, E3, E2 or EA (or anywhere else around engin), please return to the security post at either E5 or E3A.

I lost it around the afternoon after my lab in the morning at E4-03-07 (Digital Electronics Lab). My routes can be traced from E4-03-07 and to E3-06-11 and then to EA level 2. I only lost it this afternoon :(

My route was probably E4-03-07, then I took a lift to E4 level 5, walked past some study benches and LT1/2 and towards the toilets near E3-06-08 which is also near a water cooler which is next to a staircase landing. Then I proceeded to E3-06-11 for a tutorial I wanted to ""crash"", but the tutorial was cancelled so I went to EA level 2 (via passing by LT7) and then I realized my bottle was not with me when I was at EA.

Although it is just a water bottle, it is something I have grown sentimental towards over the course of a few months. I got it during a holiday to Melbourne during the summer break.

I know maybe it does sounds funny, but this water bottle is my favourite water bottle :/

The people behind it are claiming that they are “fighting” for the environment. Yet, we see the same people driving their own cars daily, taking Grab out of convenience, taking planes for leisure purposes, eating meat daily etc, harming the environment in more ways than using 100000 plastic straws would. 
An organisation that does not practice what it preaches has absolutely zero credibility. 

If a staunch environmentalist succeeds in lobbying the removal of shuttle buses around NUS, stating that we can all walk/use bikes and not be “lazy”, I am sure there would be an uproar, even amongst the supporters of “ban-the-straw”, due to the inconvenience caused. Who then sets the standard? Why is it that your convenience in taking the shuttle bus matters while my convenience in using straws does not? “The extra 20minutes of walking wont kill you” is the equivalent answer to “Bringing and washing a metal straw wont kill you”. 

“But at least we are doing something”. Once again, who sets the standard? The fact of the matter is we are ALL “doing something”. My choice of taking public transport instead of taking grab is “doing something”. If the standard is set to making meat only available on Mondays and Fridays, would BTS supporters be agreeable? After all, we do not need to eat meat and saving the earth is definitely more precious than your mere desire of wanting to consume meat.

54002,"I had always believed that love is a choice. It happens because two people have made a decision to commit themselves to one another. When I saw how my parents' divorce had caused so much pain and misery to my mother even after a decade, I promised myself that I must always choose forgiveness no matter how ugly things become. So regardless of what my boyfriend or his family did to me, I forgave. Every single wrong, even if they are marked as red flags by my friends or family, I consciously choose to sweep them under the carpet one by one. 

But I am so tired. It has become difficult and exhausting to love him. Every day, I feel increasingly more detached and recently, I feel like I have reached my breaking point. Because of his impatience, he has caused a permanent shift in my medical condition for the worse. And now, I feel so bitter towards the man I once loved. I keep telling myself to forgive, but I really can't. I am just so angry and filled with hatred that I ripped the carpet apart. Now, I pick those mistakes up one by one, reminding myself of what he has done. The things in the past I thought I forgave, now makes me burn with hatred and rage.

I was so prepared to end this relationship. But before I could, he sensed it. He realised I stopped texting as much so he unmuted me. He says ""I love you"" whenever he sees me but it doesn't reach my heart anymore. He used to limit our dates to two meals a week but now, he wants me to come over almost every single day. I feel a change and I went soft. But at the same time, I am not won over. I can't seem to love him anymore. What he has done still cuts me deep so I give stupid excuses to slowly detach myself from him. ""You live too far."" ""You are too calculative."" ""Your parents treat me like I don't exist."" Things that don't matter are suddenly cited as my main reasons to push him away. Because while I am bitter, I can't bring myself to tell him the truth and the weight of what he has done to me. 

This one-sided relationship has turned a hundred and eighty degrees. Stepping away and looking at us, I can't help but feel like I am the bad person. Now, I am the unfeeling one. He is the one trying to make things work and I am the one detaching myself and making him cry. 

I feel bad and I think I should stop, not out of love, but out of the commitment I made to him 4 years ago. After all, love is a choice, isn't it? Even if the heart is confused, as long as there is a decision to commit, it will work out eventually. This is the man I promised, the one I gave my heart to. I don't want him to be cast aside. I don't want him to be left alone. But I am so conflicted. 

Either way, break up or stay, something doesn't feel right. I don't want to break his heart especially now that he has seemed to change. But I feel like I can't be with him anymore because of all the irreversible mistakes he has made. I am lost and so confused. I simply do not know what to do. "
