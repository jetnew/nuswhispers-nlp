59898,"Just out of curiosity, do you guys think lighter skin is more attractive or darker skin (despite other factors, looks, height etc.)? I feel Singaporean Chinese usually have darker skins compared with people from East​ Asia(China, Korea, etc.), and the influence from Korea and Japan is that people prefer lighter skin "
59897,"Dear guys out there, I am in need of serious advice.

I am currently 30, and I met a guy who works as a financial advisor in his mid 30s, which I assumed he should be either 37 or 38 this year. Basically, I am his client, and we met a few months back.

We started off just purely business. One day when we were scheduled to meet, something happened at home, so I had to reschedule the meeting. And that lead us to a conversation. I am actually kind of confused by the signals he sent because I know I started falling for him (a few months later). Please correct me if I am wrong.

1. Why would someone spend time chatting with a client? Its like almost everyday. This continued for some time, then we stopped messaging daily, and I try not to send him messages. Even now, he still send me messages every few days to check on my life.

2. We go out on random dinner/lunch dates. We just set a date to exercise together.

3. One night I told him I missed him, and he said it will be irrational if he missed me. It was quite late that night and he drove to my place and we hang out the whole night with some heart to heart talk. He said he is still single because he didn't want commitment.

4. When something happened at my home, he came over, and sent me to places (which kind of warm my heart)

5. He stays alone. He doesn't invite me to his place, but he self invited himself to my place by saying ""occasionally he can stay over at my place if my family is not around"". 

I mean, I try to be rational and not think too much into it or read between the lines, but his actions are kind of confusing to me. I know I am definitely interested in him, and I feel he that he is too. But he says he doesn't want commitment, and if that is so, why does he still keep sending mixed signals? Should I ask him upfront what he wants?

I couldn't be waiting infinitely if he doesn't want to commit right? Even though on many levels, we definitely click well. I certainly won't mind spending time to get to know each other better at this stage if he has feelings. I feel that the feeling is both mutual, just that I am unsure how to proceed from here. 

Serious advice only please."

59893,"I got close to this girl in my course and we click v well tgt. I knew from the start she has a boyfriend in smu, but found myself falling for her anyway. When I told her of my feelings last week (not meant to be a confession, but more of a discussion of what to do from there), she was understanding and apologised. She told me if she didn’t have a bf alr she would’ve liked me too. I was really surprised.

59889,Any advice on what I should get for a graduation gift for a female acquaintance?
59888,I was talking to a friend the other day and he mentioned that his recently graduated gf was earning 8k fresh out of college at a famous tech company. And her friends who ended up working in those companiss' home offices in the States earn even more! Is this true? For a fresh graduate???
59887,"Might sound like a dumb question, but guys how do you tell if someone is ""the correct one""?

All those stories about ""meeting your soulmate"" ""having butterflies when you meet"" ""always checking your phone for their msg"" thing don't feel true so I don't know what to do now. How to decide if someone is the one I should commit to? Wait for a good feeling? I don't want to hold people up or prolong this.."

59884,"Anyone here identifies as an old soul? Or has bf or friends who are old souls? I really like a guy who is the same age as me but identifies as an old soul. I'm drawn to him partially because of his maturity and him sharing quite some similar characteristics, interests and values as me. We are both introverts hence our friendship development is slow but at a comfortable pace. Though we knew each other for years, it's only last year we started to have more contact with each other and I developed feelings for him along the way. Right now, we have opened up to each other more through texts, talking about what we are looking for in relationships, what we want our future to be, our current lives etc. Things go deep at times. Of course we do have casual conversations I do have a feeling that both of us enjoy these exchanges of texts, not too frequent but at a comfortable frequency of once or twice every week. I'm pretty sure, we will also feel the closeness irl but as we are introverts, probably not so fast yet. But it seems like he doesn't like to always hang out with ppl so often and that's including me so I'm with that, I'll give him the personal space he needs. Sometimes I do really want him to also reciprocate my feelings but I know I can't take it too fast if not all is gone. I guess I'm the only girl so far that he's opening up to right now but that doesn't mean that he likes me that way. He mentioned that he is not actively seeking for a relationship but do hope that one day he can meet someone that is able to meet the criteria he has. I can't deny that I want to be the one but I know I can't force it. I'm wondering if anyone has opinion on whether I'm taking things in the correct direction? "

59880,"I took my CS3230 exam at the same time, same hall as the CS2040 exam. Even I could see how badly the exam was set because the prof kept announcing changes every 20 minutes. It was annoying for me to sit through that noise while trying to concentrate, but it must have been even harder for you guys taking CS2040 to concentrate too.

Your Prof has been doing that for quite a few years, actually. Last time when I was taking another module under him 2 years ago, he would scream across the exam hall if he finds anyone writing after the exam ended. Yeah it's wrong to keep writing after the exam. But, if you're the invigilator, you should just call them out with a normal voice and write their number down. No need to scream at them when there are other students taking longer exams in the same hall. Not to mention the paper was full of errors at that time as well.

I know there are lots of idealists here saying ""ohh, you should raise these issues directly to the profs not whine here on whispers"" but let me tell you this - he hasn't changed. For 2 years. You don't think my batch wrote comments to him in the module review? I know at least I did. But some people never change.

Just remember that there are more good profs in soc than bad profs. And if you're taking 2040 you're likely to be y2 or y1 so also keep this in mind - its really hard to get things changed in this faculty so you sometimes just have to suck it up when you encounter bad profs. And the faculty office won't do much for you to improve that. Spend more time thinking about the good profs... Haha. "
59879,"I was the one who wrote the original confession #59879 regarding the debate which sparked on the 60/70-40/30 instead of 50-50 with my fiancé. Thank you for the advice and input from the helpful ones - Eventually, we agreed on a 60-40 arrangement for the wedding/house because backstory is, I have a car which I’m paying by myself (not sharing the loan with him because I needed it for my work) and supporting my parents too while he isn’t. Yes, car is a big ticket item but he is working in an office job so it doesn’t seem fair he chip in for it, because we only use it over weekends for dates. Guess I missed those out in my previous confession, my output is definitely more even though we’re earning the same range. Anyway apart from the above, I find it so hard to save each month because of the commitments! Life’s tough.

But if they get unwanted pregnancy, abortion, emotional manipulation, used by men etc, they deserve absolutely NO sympathy AT ALL since they bring everything upon themselves and they are fully aware of the risk they are putting themselves in. 

No need to be white knight because nobody will appreciate you. The girls will just smear you into a busybody bigot patriarch controlling their sexuality. As the Chinese saying goes 不见棺材不掉泪，let them learn it the hard way (no pun intended)!! "
59875,"CS2030 might not be the perfect module, but SoC certainly shouldn't lower the bar just because of the difficulty. We should continue to build a world class curriculum known for rigor. If anything, it should be more enriching or difficult. For:

1. New CS students. If CS2030 is too hard for you right now, it is time to evaluate whether CS is for you or not. If you really like CS but have weak fundamentals, work on them because things should only get tougher.

2. IS/BA students who are forced to take CS2030. You might think that CS2030 is a ""CS"" course and it is unfair that IS students need to take on the same rigor. But I've seen too many IS students selling themselves in the job market that they know both CS and business. If you want to be treated like one (paid like one), then act like one and do it well.

3. Students who are taking CS as a minor or major. Yes, this is how CS is. I still recommend that you try your best to do it well. Dont lament that you lack fundamentals unlike CS students because most CS students here only took CS1101S before taking CS2030 and CS1010S is should be enough."
59872,"Need some advice guys.

I’ve been working for about 2.5 years now. After graduating, I joined a graduate programme in Finance with a large global MNC. Benefits were good there, and the organizational culture was great. People were genuinely nice and I got on very well with almost everyone I worked with. Work was mostly comprised of classroom learnings and small group projects with my fellow graduate trainees as well as overseas rotation stints. It got pretty boring because I didn’t really do anything value-added until my final overseas rotation when I got really hands-on with budgeting and Business Intelligence. People liked me because I was really good with automation of work through programming, and was doing really well, I was noticed by my mentors and the senior managers throughout the company. Because of this, the company decided to send me to a remote country with limited internet connectivity in a permanent role as a Data Analyst, to launch the business there. I didn’t want to go, plus the role was not even in Finance or FP&A related. So when another large firm headhunted me, I jumped at the opportunity without thinking.

It turned out to be a mistake. The new role (based in Singapore) was so routine even though it was FP&A. I hardly needed to analyse anything, it was more of a reporting role, and systems were so limited in capabilities that it created extra work. Company was toxic in culture, my boss didn’t mentor me the same way my previous boss did, and I was left to figure things out myself. Although my learning curve was steep, I was sickened to the gut with the stupidity of the business philosophy (that of extreme cost cutting, with no focus on topline revenue growth). People were not as receptive towards improvement or automation, and I was told not to rock the boat. So 6 months in, I resigned.

It took me a couple of months to find another job, being a bit more selective this time. I’m currently 3 weeks into my next role, a commercial business partner in a growing start up. The role is fulfilling, and I do a lot more financial modelling work (which I love). Everything is great here, except one downside: my boss.

This guy came from an investment banking background, and is super demanding. He even explicitly said that if I’m not prepared to work overnight and on weekends, then this role is not for me. I’m always kept on my toes and neglecting family and friends just to keep up with his expectations. He sends chaser emails and whatsapp texts all through the day. I work 14 hours a day, and too afraid to even break for lunch. I guess I am struck with so much fear because this job is important to me (I cannot do another short term tenure again). 3 weeks in and I am exhausted, my heart beats so fast from the intensity and pace of my boss. 2 weeks ago I couldn’t deliver 1 forecast projection and he lashed out via an angsty email. So I squeezed more hours to deliver the week after and yet he was less than impressed. With so much to catch up on the new business and being overwhelmed with information and deadlines, I really don’t know how long I can last. I will still try my best, but I have been doing so since I joined. Any advice on what I should do? Change my mentality or something?"
59871,"I completely agree with all the posts about cs2030 workload. I'm also someone who did well for 1010 and really enjoyed it. However, I find myself spending most of my time on 2030 this sem, what with all the labs (they even released one during recess week??) and the individual project. Honestly the lecutre slides and teaching for the first semester was a complete mess and only made learning things harder. This mod is making this sem super stressful for me, and as much as I still have an interest in coding (I'm not a CS student) this has definitely been a rather shitty experience."
59868,"OP of #59830 here

I wish people would stop misreading posts and assuming everyone's life story-- this should apply to every post. It's puzzling bc nowhere did I say I find part-tine jobs disrespectable, I said my parents find it disrespectable, and I even put the word disrespectable in air quotes. 

Even more bizarre is the assumption that I get 750 a month, or that I spend all of that on alcohol and clubbing. I do spend on alcohol, but I'm a very light drinker, I eat two meals a day, and I don't club. Whatever is leftover, I save it up, because if my parents ever find out I'm gay, they will kick me out, so I need some money to tide me over while finding a job. 

I also make extra money from experiments and freelance work because I can hide those income-generating activities. 

But you know what? Why should have to explain myself so thoroughly- my diet, my freelance work, even my sexuality? Why do people assume the worst, the most ""privileged and entitled"" of people who dont have a part-time job, especially when it is because their parents won't let them? I don't agree with my parents, but most parents have their idiosyncrasies. Do you turn the house upside-down for every little thing you don't agree with them about? 

I'd hate to pull the ""asian values"" card, but I'd thought people here would know what it means to try for family harmony. And don't assume and judge when you almost never know a person's full story."

59863,"I read that the median grade for Harvard graduates is an A-. I don't know about how others think but I think NUS and their bell curve seems like a pretty shitty deal. While  NUS wants to keep its grades and degree valuable, colleges such as HYP seems to have grade inflation and still are wonderful. Companies all want and prefer FCH so isn't it not the duty of NUS to give out more? 

I think that forcing students into a bell curve isn't good at all as it makes everyone more competitive and less collaborative. College is a place to learn, but ends up with people who just try to game the system of trying to get the grades while forgetting what they learn the following sem. Professors should set reasonable papers instead of making the paper too easy or hard and then use the bell curve as it doesn't do anyone any good. 

Thoughts? Hope someone can provide a healthy debate and discussion here and enlighten everyone. Cheers"
59862,"Hi I really wish you could post this cause I feel really bad I need this out of my mind, here goes!

Yesterday was NUS' open house and like everyone, I was eager to check out the various accommodations that NUS could offer to make school life more vibrant.
So my friend and I decided to sign up for a tour around Raffles Hall mainly because it was the only hall offering tours on that day.

After the tour, we had ice cream, drinks, popcorns, cotton candy which was really awesome and I really thank them for putting in so much effort!!!

So I had a drink in my hand (some sparkling drink which was really refreshing ) but I just finished drinking it and was waiting for the shuttle bus to ferry us back to UTown.

There was a guy who seemed really awkward, as he just sheepishly stood there when a bunch of commitee members of Raffles Hall walked passed him. After a while, he approached us as we were still waiting for the bus. We found out that he was also part of the committee member and he was a year 3 student who transferred from Mechanical Engineering back in Year 1 to Data Analytics.

From the conversation, I could tell that he was really trying his best to be proactive and outspoken even though I could sense he was really uncomfortable. I REALLY applaud his willingness to step out of his comfort zone to interact with total strangers i.e. me and my friend.

Afterwhich I casually said that the weather was so hot and asked if I could have another drink. He gladly took the glass bottle from my hand and without hesitation said he will get me another. (It was actually quite a distance from where I was to get the drink)

Here comes the terrible part.

While he went to get me a drink, our bus came! I tried to walk really slowly to the bus hoping he would appear soon. After a while, he did appear with the bottle in his hand. The distance from where he was and where the bus was located was pretty far. Unfortunately, I was already halfway up the bus when I spotted him. Despite the fact that he wouldn't have caught me, he still waved his hands so vigourously at me and ran towards the bus. Yeah the bus left subsequently, and he stood there awkwardly with the newly opened bottle of drink.

I could have waited for him to come but there were others on the bus too and I didn't want to keep them waiting.

I FELT SO BAD!

I just want to point out that on my part, I am really sorry and I should have waited for him and not leave him. If he is reading this and I really hope he is, please don't be discouraged and don't let this misunderstanding affect you. I really hope that you will still have the courage to approach people to make friends with them even though I know how hard it may feel. You have gone the extra mile and your kindness will be deeply appreciated!!"
59861,Has anyone tried staying on campus (specifically halls) from Y3 onwards? How is it like? I want to do something different with my life before I graduate.
59860,"You know what's weird? Like I recall Open Day being met with cynicism from my peers being ""omg just wait till you see the REAL NUS!!!"". But... as a Year 4, I honestly will miss my time in NUS. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones, but these past 4 years have been life-changing. Perhaps it is a rare situation, as I was fortunate enough to stay on campus, and learned/changed enough to change my career path completely and switch faculties. Having experiences that changed my spiritual outlook also helped to resolve some of the trauma I bottled in for the longest time.

It feels weird, since it is week 8, and some of my juniors are waiting for the sem to end amidst mid-terms (my CAP died a long time ago, so no stress there). But there's a tinge of sadness with it. Even though I've cried a good bunch these past 4 years but it has taught me so much as well. Thanks NUS, even though I haven't left you, just the thought of this chapter of my life coming to an end is already making me emotional again. 

In short, really appreciate this time. Those who have been through internships, or already have working experience, trust me - like, projects may seem horrible, but this period of time is something you will never get back. Enjoy it for what it is, even as impossible as it may seem.

We have different cliques in school, because she's double major and I'm not, so i dont get a chance to talk to her much. I know she doesn't have a bf/gf (idk her orientation) atm and her clique is mostly girls and guys from her double major. Don't give suggestions like asking her out straight because I don't even have much opportunities to talk to her without her friends around, let alone creep her out by asking her qns like that, (also i'm too shy to ask her out :P unless i know for sure she likes me back).

That being said, there's still plenty of guys that's charisma + character which makes NUS a better place. We need less of arrogant dudes in NUS.

There's really a fine difference between charisma and arrogance.

59850,"Dear #59730, with regards to your question on how to start a relationship, I have some legit advice for you. 

Step 1: Find someone you like. You can download dating apps, join interest groups or simply stalk people on fb/ig.

*Tip: Avoid people who are obviously out of your league and the delusional/stuck-up ones who think they are too good for everyone*

Step 2: Find something you like about yourself. If you can't even find it then sadly you cannot expect anyone else to like you. 

Step 3: Show off the things you like about yourself e.g. if you like your body, you can wear clothes that accentuate your body. If you like your face, you're most likely a narcissist and you probably shouldn't date anyone. 

Step 4: Befriend the person you like. 

Example:
You saw a random cute girl on fb. You drop her a message e.g. ""Hey, you look pretty, where you from?""
P.S. This only works if you are not ugly.

Step 5: Talk to the person you like on a regular basis. Keep it casual. Mai kanchiong.

Step 6: Ask the person you like if she would like to go out with you. 

First impression counts. 
Put on your best outfit, choose somewhere classy, recce the place beforehand, get her a bouquet of flowers, hold the door for her, etc. 

Expected total damage = $100-200. 

*Tip: the higher the damage, the higher the probability of a second date*

Step 7: Continue to ask the person you like to hang out on a regular basis. This should last a few weeks or months. So get ready to find a part-time job to cover the expenses. 

Step 8: Plan a romantic date for the person you like and ask her to be your gf. 

Expected total damage = your salary for the entire month.  


tl;dr: How to start a relationship? -> Be rich.

So I distanced myself, basically ditching them and their problems. I know this is terrible. But I wish they'd just seek proper help instead. I can offer you advice countless times but if you won't listen and talk about the same problems again and again (and get even worse...), what can I do? 

It's not as if I'm not empathetic at all, I was depressed and suicidal too so I know it's lonely and hard.  Your emotions are not rational. No one understands. But it's possible to survive and pull through. It took years but I'm so much better now. Maybe you can do it too. Just please. Remember that your friends are not your free counsellor. I know it's tough but don't make it so hard for others to stay with you. Don't make others your crutch. No one can help you if you keep refusing help.

I wish people would stop misreading posts and assuming everyone's life story-- this should apply to every post. It's puzzling bc nowhere did I say I find part-tine jobs disrespectable, I said my parents find it disrespectable, and I even put the word disrespectable in air quotes. 

Even more bizarre is the assumption that I get 750 a month, or that I spend all of that on alcohol and clubbing. I do spend on alcohol, but I'm a very light drinker, I eat two meals a day, and I don't club. Whatever is leftover, I save it up, because if my parents ever find out I'm gay, they will kick me out, so I need some money to tide me over while finding a job. 

I also make extra money from experiments and freelance work because I can hide those income-generating activities. 

But you know what? Why should have to explain myself so thoroughly- my diet, my freelance work, even my sexuality? Why do people assume the worst, the most ""privileged and entitled"" of people who dont have a part-time job, especially when it is because their parents won't let them? I don't agree with my parents, but most parents have their idiosyncrasies. Do you turn the house upside-down for every little thing you don't agree with them about? 

I'd hate to pull the ""asian values"" card, but I'd thought people here would know what it means to try for family harmony. And don't assume and judge when you almost never know a person's full story."
59827,I'm a foreign student but I'm nowhere near those foreign talents. I have below average grade and I'm now worried that I could not find a job after graduation since there is a hiring restriction on foreigners (signed the tuition grant agreement that requires me to work in Singapore for at least 3 years). I agree that Singaporeans should be prioritized in hiring. After all this is your country but I don't know... I just feel worthless because I'm just average (or below) and doubt that there would be companies who are willing to sponsor my employment pass considering there are so many brighter individuals out there...
59824,"This may sounds like a strawberry question. If someone who hated you/backstabbed you in the past is in a company, would you still join the company?

59823,"To all the kids complaining about CS2030, u haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg, if you wanted a walk in the park, quit CS and transfer to another course. 

If you cannot even self study hard enough, retake CS1010 because your basics aren't even up to par, that's why you find yourself going back to searching the same old stuff you should have learnt. 

SoC modules pride themselves on never spoonfeeding students, if you think CS2030 is that difficult and u want to complain, you might as well get a degree in complaining because the moment you take higher level CS mods, you will be complaining 247.

Module easy, complain, module difficult because too lazy to put in effort complain. 
Seriously? 

Next time you graduate complain because that person who bothered about self learning and put in hell lot of effort got the job you wanted.

Think of all the time u could have spent doing something else instead of complaining. "
59822,"I am a girl and I have a pretty close guy friend. We used to be close since we share the same taste in movie and music. Sometimes, we would go for meals together (like 2 times a week or once a week) and we would occasionally text.

There's a catch. The reason that I'm so comfortable being together with him because he shared with me that he's looking for a gf that has the same religion with him. And since I don't follow that religion, I felt reassured that I was out of his dating pool. Hence, i have always truly treated him as a friend and nothing else, despite my other friends occasional teasing of us being a couple.

However, i wonder why, but something changed. It feels as if suddenly, he no longer puts in any effort in our friendship anymore. He no longer jios me out for lunch and we no longer pm each other. It's a gradual process since I still made an effort to pm him and ask him how are his deadlines etc. But his replies, from one to two sentences, becomes single word replies. When I tell him about my worries, he gives nothing than a mere sticker.
I wonder what has happened. We definitely didn't have a big argument or sth like that, but somehow we just fall apart. It's really sad. I consider the possibility of him getting a gf but if he did, he could have told me and i would keep my distance understandably, though initially we were also not that close together.

What happened? It was a cool friendship and it's just suddenly gone. What should I do? What's happened to him for him to treat me that way? "
59821,"Fun memories from NUS:

During y2, my friend and I were doing group project with another fellow. That fellow is a control freak and would try to micro-manage the 2 of us. So my friend and I decided to mess things up (our cap is too cui anyways).

Anyways, the project consisted of a presentation and a report. While he will try to micromanage us, we will always give him utter rubbish. Like copy paragraphs directly from wikipedia or random links from google search and send to him for ""Review"". When he force us to accept his suggestion and we said okay but just do it completely wrong. Example: he wanted us to find good images that can be used for the presentation, we had 1 or 2 images that seems to fit the topic while the rest were nonsense from random google search. 

I still remembered sending him a picture of a cat and said that it would fit our presentation. He replied, asking if we are messing with him. I told him it looked cute and proceeded to send him a few more puss in boots. 

Towards the end, he was pissed mad and wanted to report us to the prof. We toned down a little while starting to mess with the slides (hidden sound clips that plays during slide show). Can you imagine giving presentation with random sound effect like ""That's right"", ""Way to go"" or even an ""Aw yeah!!"" added as you made your points. 

We didn't do too lousy but sorry, Richard from FASS. It was still fun time. All 3 of us are graduating this year. Though it is likely, we wouldn't meet again."

59803,"I'll be honest. I kept my virginity all the way till I was 25. I have a super high sex drive - I literally don't know another guy or girl whose sex drive is higher than mine. So any of you could guess how damn hard I fought to keep it for so long.

Long story short, something snapped, I broke up. And this was what I needed to get over that rough patch. Losing my virginity. After all, I was in a place where I had nothing left to lose, and nothing else to abuse. So abuse sex I did.

So I hooked up. With the first girl I could find willing to do it. She was a whole lot more experienced than I was. But honestly, there were so many of my expectations which were broken that night. About sex.

The first was that it would feel wonderful. Honestly, it's overrated. Sex is a shit ton of hard work, and if I may be honest while I've learnt ways to make sex feel really great, and while it could sometimes make me convulse in pleasure, I'd honestly trade it for other pleasurable things any day. Pleasurable things like Wagyu beef, wasabi, or matcha ice cream. Those provide almost all the pleasure, with none of the hard work. And there are some days with sex where you put in all of the hard work and you get little to none of the satisfaction. That never happens with Wagyu, Wasabi, or Matcha ice cream. All of the three items give predictable highs, with none of the work put in.

The second was that something would change about me after my first time. I mean for so long we were taught we should keep our first time for someone special. That it would be like unwrapping a gift after marriage. Which was honestly bullshit. After taking my virginity, the girl I was with told me ""congrats. You're a man now."" I kept mum. Because the only thought going through my head was ""Yeah right. I don't feel like anything has changed at all.""

Also, for those of you who might say ""it didn't feel that good cuz it wasn't with someone you loved""........well. so I took the virginity of my ex-gf. I loved her. Thing is, despite that, sex with her had always been meh.

But well, there are people who are particular about keeping sex for the first time. Or people who view me differently after knowing I had sex. And I think they're just ridiculous. Apart from the fact that I know what to do to make a girl feel good, and I've got practical experience (rather than just theoratical), nothing has actually changed about me at all."
59802,"I’m really disgusted by my friend and I want to seek NUSWhispers’s opinion on whether I’m overreacting. 

Personally I think fwb is wrong but I never ever judge or criticized others for having fwb. So basically the incident goes like this: 

I have this female friend who has fwb. Since protection is not 100% foolproof, she somehow unluckily got pregnant. Her fwb didn’t  want to take responsibility and ran away. She got no one to turn to (she claimed her parents would kill her if they know what she did) and came to me for help. She cried so pitifully that afternoon and begged me to save her. I advised her to call hotlines and social worker etc but she didnt want. She cried and cried threatened to killed herself if I don’t help. 

Upon seeing that she was so mentally unstable, I sympathized with her and help her with the abortion process all the way from finding a legit doctor to signing medical papers. Trust me, it’s a dam nightmarish, troublesome and embarrassing ordeal, especially since I’m not even the guy who impregnated her. 

Now, this is the key part. Lo and behold, after everything was settled, now she is having fwb again just 3 months after the incident. I was baffled and criticized her for not learning from her lesson. To my disbelief, she said that she learnt her lesson. The lesson is to use more protections during sex. Casual sex is ok and I have no rights to dictate her body with my traditional viewpoint. 

Oh my goodness.. I’m utterly disgusted and disdained at her. I hate to use this word but h*e is the only word I can think of to describe how I feel. Is this normal or am I really overreacting? "
59801,"I wanted to move on very long, but after what #59073 has written, it evoked my memories once more. TLDR, I am just a jerk who would like to thank someone who once appeared in my life and taught me to be a better person.

Hi F, I am not sure if you would be reading this, since I got to know you while I was exchanging and you probably wouldn't follow this page. I was not looking for a relationship prior to this and most of my encounters with other girls ended after a few lukewarm exchanges, until you showed up. 

Despite my carefree personality, I am a totally different person when it comes to work. Literally no smiles, dull and often the epitome of looking resentful. It was only I met you when I told myself I will be ready to settle and be less carefree, even if it means my lifestyle would change and I might have to relocate. Through my exchanges with you, I got to know you better. 

Through some misunderstanding, we drifted apart. I remember you for calling me over-sensitive when I try to break the ice with you once more. And I broke your trust by telling things that you confided in me because you trusted me. I am sorry for breaking that trust. It was you who thought me what is trivial to me may be important to someone else and it could well be a secret that is not meant for others to know, not even our mutual close friends. Subsequently another round of argument because of other things made me resolute that our friendship was gone, let alone for that slight possibility of romance which might have developed. 

You warmed up to me after that, all of a sudden. I remember I wasn't responding to the hints you made, repeatedly the whole night while we were out wth our friends. It must have been hard and embarrass for you to give so many hints and it's so obvious that our friends around us would have gotten it. Even after that night, you tried to talk to me, but I started drawing boundaries - replying less frequently, deciding to hang out lesser with you and probably you could feel that I wasn't as warm as I was to you prior to that. You continued to follow my IG stories and my posts and I knew that. I just don't know how to approach you and what were you after. I was just so sure that I might not be the one for you after all and our interactions just went to as good as zero.

Now that I am back home and whenever I play truth or dare, or when I have downed some alcohol, I will try to tell myself to not share with anyone this encounter. There are just too many ifs in the process. What if I did not share out what turned out to be your guarded secret? What if we warmed up to each other at the same time? What if I actually come and speak to you despite whatever that happened? 

The worst part is just when I thought I have put behind this incident, I realised I didn't. Whenever I started to HTHT, whenever I drink, I will be regretting over my mistakes. I just couldn't find anyone that would made me change myself for her again. I think that I only have myself to blame ultimately. Yes, I am a jerk, an egoistic man, behind a front that appears mature.

I heard from my friend that you have started seeing someone. I hope that the person will treat you better than any of the guys you had. I just hope that the next time we meet again, we will be smiling at each other and we could become closer friends, if I may. 

Thank you for reading such a long post. I am not sure if this is what they meant by the first love, since we never really started. Btw F, thank you for enabling me to grow up and to be more sensitive to someone else's needs and wants. And for others out there, you just have to talk to the other person if you really want answers to your questions. Don't be a jerk like I once was.

I guess it's time to move on at last. "
