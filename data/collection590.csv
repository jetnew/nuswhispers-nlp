59098,"Hi, anybody attended Yonsei international summer school before?
I would really appreciate it if you could share your experiences of the challenges that you faced (language barrier, transportation from Incheon international airport, grocery and so on).  Are the taxis in Korea safe for a female solo traveller without a good grasp of the Korean language? Also, how did you overcome the difficulties that you faced?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!"
59097,"Fresh grad salary survey is out again. Seriously don't understand why most people don't believe the figures, especially what CS grads are making. I started working two years ago, and was paid several hundred bucks above the survey figures. I was pretty happy at first, but after I found out what all my SoC schoolmates were making, my confidence was shaken a little. I'm pretty sure I'm just mediocre and my starting was around average only. Why is is so difficult for people to believe that? Isn't it just simple market economy? When the demand is high, the price goes up. Today it's CS that's hot in demand; tomorrow it could be material science and engineering; the day after tomorrow it could be aerospace engineering (which NUS doesn't offer btw). It's not like I suddenly earn less just because you don't believe it."
59096,"Why do people go to university? I feel like I've just wasted 4 years of my life and so much of my parent's money, studying something I thought I had interest in (but no longer the case now), and with no future job prospects. Even for the more mainstream and popular courses, so many people still end up doing something outside of their field of study. 

So please, can anyone enlighten me, what is the point of going to university? I feel like I've wasted my parent's money and let down their expectations... Doesn't help that both my parents have never gone to uni nor even had a diploma to get to where they are today. And i'm just here, being pessimistic about my future (the lack of one). 

Should i just drop out now/graduate with a 3 yr degree (if possible) or just endure an honor's year (dk what for? The prestige?) "

59093,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years and we’ve been talking about marriage... rather, I was the one who kind of brought it up first (in terms of our ability to buy a house). Although he has set time aside for house-viewing etc, I’m worried that he doesn’t even love me at all, actually only going with the flow. These days, our conversations are dull; he doesn’t try to engage more. And when we went for a wedding together, I can see that his friends all had that loving look when looking at their girlfriends and wives, while my boyfriend doesn’t at all. Is our relationship going to be over....? I dare not bring it up to him because it shows a lot of my insecurity and I worry that he will confirm my fears T_T"
59090,"Having dealt with real incels, what I found unique about them is that they have nothing to lose. There is no leverage on such people, they are already socially shunned and have no stake in anything.

I'm not one of those flag-bearing, guns-waving gungho NS officer who think that the army is Number One, but I just cant help but stare in disbelief when these 20, 21 year-olds laugh at the 2 year gap as if it's all fun and games.

59087,"pretty interesting if you read #59037 and #59070 back-to-back... I've seen too many guys jump to the conclusion that girlfriends ""withhold sex"" from them bc those girls are evil villains trying to manipulate them, and totally these girls are cheating on them and having lots of sex with other guys. These are usually the sort of guys who also try hard to continuously pester and coerce their dates into constant sex. 

Sometimes, two people just have an incompatability when it comes to their sex drives. It doesnt mean the girl is cheating and ""withholding sex"", which btw is such a problematic term bc that's implying sex is some natural right you have and women must constantly give it to you. Their lower sex drive is not necessarily manipulation, and it's not necessarily cheating. 

Your gf doesn't owe you sex, and she isnt definitely having sex with hundreds of other men, bc have you considered that some people arent as desperately horny as you are? Maybe she was always low libido. Maybe it went down since she was younger. Maybe you dont wash your dick. Maybe she is turned off by your hyper-paranoid personality. Sit down and talk about it, you owe each other the benefit of the doubt, but no one owes anyone sex. Get over it.

59086,"Hi, just wanna ask if anyone is keen to form a amateur cycling group. 

And by amateur, I mean like really amateur haha. My bike is a second hand bike from my cousin (foldable small bike) probably less than $100 dollars from NTUC/random sports shop. 

I have never cycled more than 5 km at once. I am interested in pushing this limit and cycling more this year. Hope to cycle more safely on park connectors cause I heard Singapore road drivers are pretty hostile towards cyclists. I stay around north east area of Singapore. Would like to cycle with a group for both companionship and I guess added safety against possible human/animal predators. 

Any recommendations of groups I can join? Do I need a strong/road/expensive bike to cycle better? What can i do from here on if I'm keen to cycle more? 

All suggestions appreciated. Thanks! "

59079,"I’m impregnated by my fwb and I feel so messed up and confused right now. I always insist guys using protection and yet it still happen...

To make things worse, I have 3 fwbs and I don’t know who impregnated me. All 3 of them insist they are 100% safe and say insist it’s either 1 of my other 2 fwbs. 

I tried to recall which session might be unsafe but I really can’t remember!! I also tried to backtrack the pregnancy but I had sex with all 3 of them around the same period, so I can’t pinpoiny who is it...

Now all 3 of them are starting to ignore me, I don’t even think they will give me their DNA to do paternal testing. 

I’m so confused, regretful and shameful right now. I’m thinking of abortion (I’m 2.5 months pregnant) but I’m so scared, especially all 3 of them don’t want to admit and nobody is here to support me. I need someone because I’m so scared to have abortion alone. My parents never knew I had this side, so I can’t let them know too...

And mid terms are coming after this recess week, I’m so overwhelmed... I just want to dig a hole and hide...

I’m at a loss... What should I do? :("
59078,"I hate nice girls.

Just exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your call logs and grinning like a fool.

But I know the truth. That's just them being nice. Anyone nice to me is nice to others too. I always end up nearly forgetting that.

If the truth is cruel mistress , a lie must be a nice girl.

That's why niceness is a lie.

I always ended up with these expectations.
And I always ended up with these misunderstandings.
And before I knew it, I stopped hoping.

A highly trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. A lone warrior, surviving hundreds of battles.

When it comes to losing, I'm the strongest.

That's why I'll always hate nice girls.

59073,"I wanted to move on very long, but after what #59073 has written, it evoked my memories once more. TLDR, I am just a jerk who would like to thank someone who once appeared in my life and taught me to be a better person.

Hi F, I am not sure if you would be reading this, since I got to know you while I was exchanging and you probably wouldn't follow this page. I was not looking for a relationship prior to this and most of my encounters with other girls ended after a few lukewarm exchanges, until you showed up. 

Despite my carefree personality, I am a totally different person when it comes to work. Literally no smiles, dull and often the epitome of looking resentful. It was only I met you when I told myself I will be ready to settle and be less carefree, even if it means my lifestyle would change and I might have to relocate. Through my exchanges with you, I got to know you better. 

Through some misunderstanding, we drifted apart. I remember you for calling me over-sensitive when I try to break the ice with you once more. And I broke your trust by telling things that you confided in me because you trusted me. I am sorry for breaking that trust. It was you who thought me what is trivial to me may be important to someone else and it could well be a secret that is not meant for others to know, not even our mutual close friends. Subsequently another round of argument because of other things made me resolute that our friendship was gone, let alone for that slight possibility of romance which might have developed. 

You warmed up to me after that, all of a sudden. I remember I wasn't responding to the hints you made, repeatedly the whole night while we were out wth our friends. It must have been hard and embarrass for you to give so many hints and it's so obvious that our friends around us would have gotten it. Even after that night, you tried to talk to me, but I started drawing boundaries - replying less frequently, deciding to hang out lesser with you and probably you could feel that I wasn't as warm as I was to you prior to that. You continued to follow my IG stories and my posts and I knew that. I just don't know how to approach you and what were you after. I was just so sure that I might not be the one for you after all and our interactions just went to as good as zero.

Now that I am back home and whenever I play truth or dare, or when I have downed some alcohol, I will try to tell myself to not share with anyone this encounter. There are just too many ifs in the process. What if I did not share out what turned out to be your guarded secret? What if we warmed up to each other at the same time? What if I actually come and speak to you despite whatever that happened? 

The worst part is just when I thought I have put behind this incident, I realised I didn't. Whenever I started to HTHT, whenever I drink, I will be regretting over my mistakes. I just couldn't find anyone that would made me change myself for her again. I think that I only have myself to blame ultimately. Yes, I am a jerk, an egoistic man, behind a front that appears mature.

I heard from my friend that you have started seeing someone. I hope that the person will treat you better than any of the guys you had. I just hope that the next time we meet again, we will be smiling at each other and we could become closer friends, if I may. 

Thank you for reading such a long post. I am not sure if this is what they meant by the first love, since we never really started. Btw F, thank you for enabling me to grow up and to be more sensitive to someone else's needs and wants. And for others out there, you just have to talk to the other person if you really want answers to your questions. Don't be a jerk like I once was.

I guess it's time to move on at last. "

59069,"Hey OP of #58999, I am in the exact same situation as you just that I'm 26 this year and my relationship is in its 6th year (and no, we're not planning to get married so soon). Even until now, my mom still frowns upon me if I hang out at my bf's place for an entire day. She still thinks that it's ""not nice"" and doesn't reflect well on my upbringing, which I find really ridiculous. My parents have always been against stayovers. I wasn't even allowed to stay over at my girl friend's place. On the other hand, my bf has always wanted his gf to have stayovers at his place, but I keep turning down his requests because I am personally uncomfortable with the idea (I have stayed over a couple of times though just to appease him). However, we have gone on overseas trips as a couple and I simply lie to my parents that I'm going with my bf and a bunch of friends lol. My parents would always ask for the contacts of the ""friends"" I'm going with and each time I give them the numbers of a couple of real friends who know my situation. What they don't know won't kill them. I know it's not a good thing to lie but I also know that sometimes, it's really hard to talk to parents about these issues. So if you find it difficult to open up to them, there's always a way to get what you want. Ultimately, parents will have an inkling of what their children are up to. It's just whether or not they want to probe into it. :)"

59066,"I'm starting to feel like I speak like my ex boss. To be honest, I hated the way she "" interrogated"" me in the past when I did something not up to her standard. Do you know what went wrong? Tell me what you are supposed to do first? She asked these kinds of questions to really find the root of the problem, but to me I felt ridiculed. I did my best to present her with the end results but somehow it did not turn out to be what we wanted. Those questions made me feel useless. 

Fast forward to today, I found myself using similar tactics posing questions to customers. I dug deep into the conversation and stopped them mid way to clarify their issues. I posed questions that were yes or no questions. I felt so bad but that's the way I did to end the question fast so that the customers get what they needed. Am I wrong to do this? Because I vowed never to be like my ex boss with her discriminatory questioning technique."

Her father and my silly brother even offers to give her allowance though she's already 26. Lucky for her, my brother has a very high paying job and her father is rich too. All she does whole day is baking and cooking and some household chores, basically just wasting life away. She has no talent, skills nor certifications, except a useless business degree from some foreign uni. When I asked her why she doesn't work, she said she's taking a break because her previous accounting job was stressful as she had alot of work to do and therefore had to OT everyday and her boss always scolds her. Such a whiner. Lazy to work then just say lazy lor. Recently my brother is planning to propose to her and he hopes that she would move in with us after marriage. My parents adore her because she always bring gifts and cook or bake for us so it's likely that she will move in with us. Although my brother is willing to take care of her finances, I still think it's stupid for my brother to waste his hard earned money on this lazy bum.

I was like wtf. anyway after my rage, two legit technician came with laptops to fix my door. and it never locked itself again. they could have called the technician on the first day of my locked room case but they didnt.

59049,"I've been reading about the cheating sagas on this page and I thought I'd like to offer my inputs. I was in a relationship with my SO for 5 years since 16. Of course we had arguments here and there but they were nothing major, I loved him like my life depended on him. He made me feel complete, happy. But 4 years into our relationship, we argued more often, especially when I was unhappy with him speaking with his female best friend every day throughout our relationship. Long story short and I don't want to relive this memory anw, he cheated on me with her. I definitely had some fault to play towards the unfortunate end of the relationship and I tried salvaging things by trying to become a better girlfriend, friend and I took him back because everyone deserved a second chance. But the cheating episode has never been out of my mind ever since, it has been consuming me inside out. I got so insecure, worried that he'll hit her up again, worried about other girls, overthinking everything. I was on the brink of suicide and my CAP flew out of the window. I did go for UHC's counselling and I felt better, but I guess when someone cheats on you, thoughts of ""why wasn't I enough"" ""if he claimed to love me so much, how come he didn't think of me when he did it with her"" ""what could I have done that could have prevented this"" ""all those times when he said he was busy, was it with her"" etc etc never goes away and up till now I have so much of anxiety and negative feelings towards most things. Anyway, we broke up 8 months later because he felt it was unfair for me to continue in this toxic relationship that was eating me alive. Even though its been 2 years since we broke it off, I miss him very much and I constantly think back to what I could've done better. But then on most days I curse myself for being an idiot, for allowing him to ruin me. 

What was supposed to have been something sacred turned out to be my ultimate ruination and destroyed whatever notion I had of 'love'. So to all of you out there who think cheating is fine or are cheating rn as I type this, please consider the feelings of your SO and break it off with them beforehand, whether its a simple fetish or power play that you like. Is this some millennial thing to be cheating on each other? After this whole episode, I can't move on. It's still at the back of my mind and I've been trying so hard to move on and keep myself busy, but on worst nights its here to haunt me like his best friend. It's really difficult so I beg you guys to reconsider whatever you're doing. Cheating has long term repercussions not just on your SO, but on you as well.

59042,"Regarding the burning of joss paper, I feel that most of you do not understand OP's perspective and judge too quickly. 

I for one live in one of those areas with a lots of older generation uncle and aunties around, so the smog from incense and joss paper burning is inevitable every year, including recent weeks. I always close the window the minute I smell them, but problem is my room is the type that is facing West, meaning it faces the sun and absorbs all the heat, and somehow my family refuse to install aircon because of some stuff that old people believe that aircon is bad for your health. So at night it can get super stuffy and hot, and closing the window is just going to circulate the hot stuffy air in the room for hours. In which case it really is an inconvenience whenever the burning occurs, so I completely emphatize with OP.

However I do agree that it is a tradition kept by the older generations. Even most of the gen X (our parent's generation) do not practice it anymore. So in a way it is kind of sad that we're losing a part of the Chinese culture.

It's been years since we spoke or seen each other and the last time I saw you was in primary school. I see you around quite often and you probably don't recognise me because I look drastically different and after losing touch for so many years; I am not even surprised that you would have forgotten me. I see you hanging around your friend and I am very happy to see that he's treating you so well. You seem really happy and I am so glad. 

We both made our mistakes and hurt each other. But primary school us barely even knew what we were doing–it was just some immature drama back then wasn't it? Funny how it seemed like such a big thing back then and in retrospect, it was so minor but blown out of proportion. Maybe you even chuckled at our immature antics when you were thinking back; I certainly did. 

A reconciliation is never going to happen. 

But even so, 
thank you for sharing happy moments with me when we were on talking terms 
thank you for teaching me how to be a better person.

thank you for being part of my childhood. "

59024,Some insurance agents/MLM marketers really made socialising so difficult. Sometimes you genuinely want to catch up with an old friend/acquaintance but they think you trying to sell them insurance or some other nonsense. This is so sad.
59023,Is it just me? I love my boyfriend but sometimes I really can't stand him to the point that I hate him. Is there something wrong with me or is there anyone who feels like this too?
59022,I think I like you but for professional reasons I don't think I'm allowed to do anything...hope you aren't taken / won't get taken in the mean time until the circumstances become appropriate.
59021,"1. Many confessions on this page are so drama.

2. Do you go to university to graduate and earn lots of money or get involved in politics, drama, relationship problems, etc?

3. Why care about what others think about you? You live for yourself, money, pleasure, and to enjoy life to the maximum.

4. No one gives a damn about your problems, be it relationship or personal problems.

5. Can't get a boyfriend or girlfriend? Then stay single. Getting married, having kids, and conforming to societal, moral, traditional values, are so old fashioned, obsolete, and such a liability, both financially and in terms of personal freedom and enjoyment.

6. Being a single professional or high-ranking civil servant, earning lots of money while doing the least work, driving a nice car, living in a condo, owning the latest iPhone, masturbating while watching porn (at least you don't get AIDS), eating fine dining, flying business class, going clubbing, and hanging out with interesting friends and colleagues who know how to enjoy life and have fun is the real deal.

7. No one likes dramatic and problematic people."

59017,"To #58976: does it matter? If you are scared, then do body check-up, at a clinic. If a man truly loves you, he loves you for the accompany. Other things are not important. "
59016,"hey #58894, I agree with you? I've been in a long term relationship and recently I found out my bf cheated on me two years ago. I was heartbroken and shocked because he's like the best bf one could ever ask for. He's always been there for me, spending most of his time with me, saving up to buy gifts and making cards for me on special occasions, helping me with my schoolwork and housework when I'm tired, taking care of me when I fell sick... At first I wanted to just break up with him but I realised that despite the cheating, nothing has changed at all. What you said is right. To me, it's as if cheating has never occurred and life goes on as usual. I was sad only after I found out about it. All along he's been treating me so well and my family loves him too. I've been very happy and content with having such a wonderful partner and we were and still are very much in love after 5 years together. Is it necessary to pursue the matter now? Should I just let the matter rest since it didn't affect our relationship at all? Should I continue staying in this relationship?"
59014,"To the OP of #58946

I for one understand you completely. The rationality behind our thoughts and feelings are completely unlike others, who are not in our situation, can understand. Firstly, I want you to know that your internal conflict is completely valid. Your feelings are your own and no one can berate you for it. 

Now, what can we do about it? You mentioned you don't see yourself marrying your current bf. Do consider this: Is this a result of your conflicted feelings for your new friend? Think hard about it and maybe you'll find more answers. These kind of soul-searching will take time. So don't pressure yourself to make such a hasty decision, only to regret it later. You'll only put yourself, and the people you love, through unnecessary pain. One other thing you should consider is, are you sure the feelings you're developing for your new friend are romantic feelings? Maybe you've fallen for the deep connection that you managed to build with him and not for the person. Then you might wonder, ""shouldn't I have such deep connections with my own bf and not someone else?"" well, you can think that way. But it's also possible to establish a connection this close with someone and not have a romance with them. The possibilities are limitless. Some people might think otherwise but, who says we have to fit what other people think?

Once you figured that out, I'm sure you'll be able to answer that question you have. I know it's a hard decision but I believe you can get through it. And remember, whenever you do decide to make that decision, own it. Own that decision. One day you'll look back and think ""maybe I should've done sth different"", but then remember that you did what YOU thought was best at that time. 

Ultimately, just slowly think through it. I'm personally still struggling, but I know my moral values. We can't always get what we want, but we can get somewhere close and still be happy. 

Wishing you all the best! "
59013,I met a new person during my one week at work(a short temporary job). I do not have his number at all. We are from different schools and there is nothing much in common though. But he is a rather nice person though. Should I ask if we could keep in contact though or will it be hard though since we are from different schools etc like there is no reason for me to contact him anymore?

59010,"I have thought long and hard. There can only be one explanation for the recent spike in sex related topics. 

It can only be to lure all those thirsty and horny JC kids who just completed their A’s, thinking that NUS have a bright and vibrant campus life!!!!!

But let me share a personal story. Once upon time when I was also a thirsty boy boy, wanting to enter NUS for the FWBs and Ons. However after I entered Uni , I realised my true interest lie in more mature women. 

TO ALL THE PROFESSORS IN NUS  , I LOVE YOU !!! <3"

59005,"The problem to fwb and dating is can be solved using a simple hierarchical system. 

By default:
Guys without fwb history date with girls without fwb history 

Guys with fwb history date with girls with fwb history. 
This ensures fairness. 

When “dating down”, ie. a person without fwb willing to date a person with fwb, the party with fwb should feel lucky and thankful that the other party don’t mind your past.  

It’s called “dating down” because people with fwb history have more LIKELIHOOD (not definitely, I know) of having undesirable traits like promiscuousity, STD and low self control and the other party needs to bear the risk. 

Similarly, when “dating up”, If the person without fwb don’t wanna date due to your fwb history, you shouldn’t feel insulted and call people narrow minded because your default pool should be people with fwb history anyways. You have more likelihood of undesirable traits compared to a person without fwb, what rights do you have to scold other people? Your default pool should be people with fwb in the first place anyways. 

Of course, this framework assumes centerus paribus"
59004,"Hi all, I’m the OP of #59004 (regarding my brother who isn’t doing anything). I made a typo by saying he hasn’t done anything for the last 23 years, when I really meant to say last 12 years (in other words, since he was 23 years old). Thank you for the advice so far and sorry for the mistake."

59000,"I don't understand why people are thinking of snatching girls away from their boyfriends.

If they are so capable that they can snatch girls away from their boyfriends, then surely they can easily chase an unattached girl of a similar calibre

If they aren't that capable, they won't succeed in snatching girls away from their boyfriend."
