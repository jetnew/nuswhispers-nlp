0,62798,"Before the exam, Prof Aaron said not to complain about the CS2100 paper in NUSWhispers. This is not a rant, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank Prof Aaron and Adi for setting this challenging paper. Through this paper, I realise there’s a gap in my knowledge and there’s just still so much more I can learn from CS2100. 

I hope that the future batches taking CS2100 will look at the past year papers (including this one) and realise early where their gaps are. I hope that all these papers can serve as a stepping stone to improve the quality of students in SoC. 

It was one crazy ride. I can never look 0s and 1s the same way anymore after this module. To my fellow CS2100 cohortmates:  we finished CS2100. Congrats to us! Give yourselves a pat on the back, regardless of how the exam went! 

With this I end this post.

1,62794,How far is it true that CS1010S is not graded on a curve? Is there strictly no curve or is there still some sort of moderation ?
2,62792,"In response to post #62733. 
A Master in Management (MiM) is a pre-experience management degree, while an MBA is a post-experience management degree (typically requiring candidates to have at least 3 years of work experience). 
The content of MiMs at most business schools are very similar to an MBA syllabus. The difference lie mainly in the mode of delivery. MiM is more theoretical while an MBA is more case-study focused, and allows candidates to draw on their fellow classmates' varied work experiences. 
Career progression for both differs too, mainly due to the W.E. MiM graduates will be recruited at analyst level, while MBA graduates will be recruited at a level commensurate to their previous W.E and position. 
MBAs are very popular in North America (being a product of American Business Schools). MiMs are very reputable in the European market (being a product of European Business Schools). In Europe, the concept of MBA is unfamiliar as students typically proceed to their post-graduation studies after undergraduate. An MiM could be seen as the cousin to the MBA. However, US Business Schools have recently been expanding into the MiM market (i.e. Duke, Northwestern, Kellogg). "

4,62788,"Would like some advice on whether i should give up my malaysian citizenship. 

I was raised in Singapore, so i pretty much speak and relate to the typical singaporean life. To me, Singapore is my homeland. With all these being said however, i still feel a sense of affilation to Malaysia. After all, it is the country where all my relatives are based and i have alot of fond memories there. I love the beautiful landscapes, the people and the food. 

And i always had a dream of making Malaysia a better country especially for non-bumiputeras. I dream of becoming rich and maybe even starting my own business, possibly being the next robert kuok so that i can perhaps, help to improve the facilities and infrastructures in malaysia and help play my part to make it a more fair playing society. I must admit, it is honestly a fair fetched dream and i don't have the slightest idea on how i can accomplish that, except maybe study hard now and think of how i can start a business to be rich?  

Given my love for both Malaysia and Singapore, should i give up my Malaysian citizenship for a Singapore one then? There are definitely more pros than cons to owning a Singapore passport and for many years my relatives in Malaysia are always in disbelief when i tell them i am still a Malaysian. They have always told me to give up on malaysia..saying there is no more hope for non bumiputeras here...

I am slightly conflicted. To be honest, i don't dare to own up that i am Malaysian because i never grew up in Malaysia and neither do i speak Malay or have a good grasp of dialects. On the other hand, i cannot call myself Singaporean too :<"

15,62774,"Hello #62774, I used to seek treatment for trauma+depression. This reply is mainly about the medication part that you mentioned. 

Do you know what meds she's taking and what their side effects are? From my own experience, it is possible that taking meds or even changing/stopping dosage can cause big changes in energy levels and personality. The patient may also not notice the changes as much as the people around her. 

This is a long shot, but I might as well make the point with my own horror story coming off Paxil. I took 10mg of Paxil per day (half a pill) for 2 months, and it worked initially. The psychiatrist then told me I could stop any time due to the low dosage, and never warned me about any withdrawal symptoms. So I stopped, and had quite strong physical and emotional side effects for two weeks (similar to the stories here: https://seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/the-hell-of-seroxat-withdrawal/). It was only later that I realised how oddly I was behaving to those around me. 

Anyway, it can be serious stuff, and it's good that you are observant and in touch with your person. Maybe you can try to find out more about the medication, and see if there's anything that doesn't add up, or seems dangerous. It's not easy caring for someone without enough knowledge. All the best!"

17,62769,"Girl who posted #62605 here. I’m very happy in my current relationship. So nope, I’m not looking for anyone to PM or date me. But if you’re a SOC guy interested in a SOC girl who’s already told you she’s single and dropped you a few hints she may be interested, please stop waiting around and make a move already!

To #62642: If you don’t get why guys should take the initiative, it’s very simple. An average girl in uni usually has more than one guy interested in her at any one time. Some of these guys would be actively pursuing her, and taking up her time and attention away from you. Unless she has the opportunity to get to know you for an extended period of time (like what happened with me and my boyfriend), her interest in you would have already peaked and faded some time after meeting you. If you don’t make the 1st move, she might never get the chance to know you better. So if a guy wants to play the waiting game and wait for the girl to make the 1st move, good luck to him! If it happens, he’s a very lucky guy. 

To #62634: You sound like the typical sweet but hopeless/clueless SOC guy I mentioned before. If you’re trying to read and analyse your girlfriend like a computer program, please stop. Girls are more complex than just a bunch of 1s and 0s. Also not all communications are verbal. If your girlfriend is exasperated, it’s because you’re only paying attention to what she says, not what she communicates. There’s a difference. If she loves you enough, she’ll try to teach you. If you love her enough, you’ll try to learn. Good luck!"

21,62764,"Saw some post recently about dating on CMB and Tinder, so I'm here to share my story

I'm a guy and 2015 Dec was when I downloaded CMB and Tinder and started to use the app in hopes of meeting new people. I used it for 6months maybe but with no real results, mostly didn't click well or just no chemistry and the daily girls I got from CMB became lesser (maybe due to my filter criteria). 

So in 2016, I decided to try out a dating agency GG (I'm quite sure you guys know which one) and signed a package with them, hoping through them will be more focus and higher match rate because of common interest. First girl didn't work out and I was together with girl no.2 (after 4 months of trying to win her). I stopped using the apps during this period. It was a good run, but we ended after 5months.  

I continued to use the app through 2017, going out as frequent as 1-2 girls a month and continued the service by GG. In 2017 sept I met this gorgeous lady which we click very well and we were on the same frequency, however it was quite shortlived after 1 month. I should have read the signs, she was merely using me as companion because she broke up with her ex one month prior. I took awhile to pick myself up because it really hit me hard, I thought she was it.

I continued to use the app to get my mind off things and to move on. In early 2018 I matched with this girl who is totally not in my criteria but decided to give it a go. We dated and got together. Fast forward 1 year later, we are talking about houses and family planning. 

TL;DR: Just keep going out and date, you'll meet many wrong people before you met the right one. Don't give up hope."

Whenever I saw the internship emails from the school, they are always looking for skillsets in these web or mobile or analytic areas. I look at the stuff CS teaches and none of them fit into any of these roles.

Granted, I understand that at the core, CS teaches fundamental knowledge to pursue deep and technical areas, and does not simply prepare one for development jobs that one can learn on the web anyway. Still, at least, little of what job titles are looking for at fresh graduate level are taught in the CS courses.

34,62744,"Does anyone feel that CS lacks rigour compared to Math? 

I've always found that a lot of CS theory (or at least how it's taught in the modules) play hard and fast with the mathematics involved. It's honestly kind of aggravating, especially when it's evident that the profs gloss over parts that they themselves don't seem too clear on. This is especially bad when some of the “proofs” the CS profs give rely on the abuse of notation or terms used..

This also seems to play into how CS modules seem kind of unstructured, especially (at least, to me since I take CS and Math modules side-by-side) how they’re taught; a typical Math topic has examples designed to illustrate a particular facet or consequence of a theorem or problem, whereas all the CS topics I’ve taken seem to involve logical leaps that the profs just kind of gloss over (or outright admit that we somehow “have” to make the leap).

Part of this is also me just ranting about how CS just doesn’t seem to have its shit together compared to the Math department; I’ve never had a Math prof be unable to answer a question, whereas I’ve had that multiple times. I’ve also never had a Math prof abuse notation or specific terms as badly as some of the CS profs I’ve had. Does anyone else feel this way?

48,62719,"Hello #62810, I'm #62719. 

You asked, ""how did you decide to leave your previous relationships and what made your current one different?""

Sometimes you meet the right person but at the wrong time. I guess my current one is the right one who appeared at the right time.

I started dating my first ex when we were both 18. We shared many common interests, which got us closer. 

However, as we got closer, I started to see how different we are. These differences often led to arguments. 

I got tired of the endless quarrelling. I felt like we are very different people and I didn't know how to resolve the issues we faced as I didn't know how to communicate well.

Maybe I thought I could find someone who would suit me better. And when this someone appeared, I felt that it was time to leave the rs. 

My second ex was a very sweet, kind and caring guy. We would spend almost every day together and prioritise our rs above everything else.

Along the way, we lost ourselves. We were trapped in our own tiny bubble. We neglected our own social circle and personal life. 

Initially this tiny bubble felt very much like a comfort zone you don't want to get out of. But eventually it felt rather suffocating.

One day you realise you don't know who you are anymore. You are probably just somebody's girlfriend. And suddenly you feel like maybe you want a guy who actually has a life of his own. And when that guy came along, I knew this rs has to end. 

Third ex - smart, funny, sociable, outgoing. All these came at a price. He has alot of female friends, many of whom happen to be quite pretty. He would hang out with them pretty often. 

I felt quite insecure whenever he goes out with these friends. I knew I wasn't confident of myself. I felt his friends are more fun and better looking than me.

I got tired of feeling insecure all the time. And when I met someone who seems like the more serious type of guy, I decided to end my rs. 

This serious guy is my current one and hopefully my last one. lol.

How is he different? Like what I said before, he's a pretty average guy and the only not so average thing about him is his love for me. 

His love is like a burning charcoal. It burns slowly but steadily. Day by day, he tries to learn more and more about me and find ways to show that he cares. Slow and steady wins the race right? 

My first ex taught me the importance of communication. My second ex taught me the importance of independence. My third ex taught me the importance of confidence. My current one taught me love. 

They are all perfect in their own ways. It's just that I met them at different stages of my life. It happens that when I met my current one, I was more ready for a relationship.

You meet different people for a different reason. Just because the relationship ended, it doesn't mean the relationship wasn't real. 

You would always have something to learn from the people you meet. Along the way, you learn to become a better person. And when the time comes, you will be ready to love and meet someone deserving of your love.

62,62698,"It's my first time to be on NUSWhispers, I just found the page quite funny sometimes, so I guess as my uni life has been quite boring, I just wanna share a story here. I'm actually a quite timid girl but I stay positive all the time. I came out from poly, started school when the other girls were all younger than me, they looked young, fresh, humorous and attractive while I was just very ordinary. I like doing things alone. I was quiet all the time in school friends' conversations and people never really remembered me. I realized maybe I was not as attractive as other girls, but it's just fine because I'm happy with who I am. During weekend, as I stay on campus, I usually go to YIH comp lab to study, I enjoy the place so much because I actually feel uncomfortable to be in crowded places like Utown. One day, while I was napping on the table (because I'm doing internship concurrently, I'm really lack of sleep), there was suddenly a guy coming in and somehow that woke me up but I wasn't totally awaken. He asked where the printing station was, and as I was just awake, I really looked silly and you know, I was just acting with my silly face, showing him to check the room next door. Apparently the photocopy room closed long time ago (omg I realized it was a wrong direction), then he came back and told me he didn't find it. So I looked around (I must look very weird at that time I guess), and showed him to check the other comp lab near the toilet. I was waiting outside while he stepped into the room and then luckily the printers were there (okay, now I know where the printers are). He was printing but then looked at me outside the door and smiled with a hand signal like ""it's ok now"". Just like that, he then came back to the lab I was sitting, said thank you and sorry for disturbing my sleep but I just felt embarrassed because even my friends never saw me sleeping or napping before as well. But it's fine until I accidentally bump to him the second time in YIH while ordering food. I don't know why he remembered me and smiled to me. I also remember him but I was just embarrassed so I passed by him very quickly. Then I realized I forgot my drink (omg why I forgot my drink) and came back to the shop where he was sitting nearby. This time I stopped and tried my best to say ""we met... uhm, the printers..., right?"". He smiled and said ""yes, the printers"". After that, I didn't know why but I felt happy because that was the first time someone actually remembered me, a very ordinary, timid, and sound-boring person like me. Again the day before, it's so happening that, I saw him again, that time I was trying my best to actually follow and hope to talk to him again but he was just walking so fast with his friends. I missed him among the crowd... 
""Hi, my first time here and my first time doing this kind of confession. I don't even know your name, your major or anything about you but just want to thank for remembering me. I might look cold and quiet, but I'm not a unfriendly person. So, if there is ever a chance that we meet again, I think I would really ask your name. Jiayous for finals and see you around (hopefully)!"""

80,62669,"After going for ICT and coming back, I've noticed that each clique or project group has a certain structure, especially if it's made up of (mostly)guys. You'll always have one or more of these people.

1. The Platoon Commander
He takes charge of the group, initiating ideas, study sessions, coordinates outings... You can always depend on him to take the lead on anything, and everyone just seems to go along with it, because it always works out in the end with him. Might also take the lion's share of the work because ""it needs to be done"" and ""Aiya easier for me to do than disturb you all"". Bonus points if he wears his OCS singlet to school or tells a shit ton of ""in my time"" stories.

2. The Platoon Sergeant
He'll be the first to voice concerns and take the lead when the PC is not around. Usually found alone if not with the group, though he fits right in when he's there. Often takes on more than the rest because he believes in leading by example and challenging himself. Might take on extra stuff to add badges to his uniform, like exchanges, double degrees or whatnot. Sometimes bites off more than he can chew and finds himself regretting it in a classic oh shit moment.

3. The Section Commanders
Usually particularly good at one thing, or maybe not really good at many things, but they still try. May make life hard for the PS when they do prove him wrong or put up differing ideas and opinions. Usually found either doing work at the last minute after procrastinating but somehow manages to get it done decently well, or being the first to jump on a major assignment so they can be choose their parts and be done with it then watch the rest suffer through the harder parts. Bonus points if they gossip about the PC and PS among themselves or often go off to take a nap.

4. The Section Members
Sometimes there when things happen, sometimes missing in action, but unfortunately mostly there to tank the saikang. Usually don't say anything and don't contribute much to decisions... But still kena when it comes to doing the work. Bonus points for wearing army tees out, or leaving group messages on ""read"". 

5. The Chao Keng
Never there when you need him. Shows up after all the work and comes up with a million excuses not to do work or contribute. Won't take the saikang, won't be there to clean up, he's the last in but first out. Bonus points if everyone secretly hates him, but is too nice to tell it to his face.

6. The Warrant Officer
Might be your age, but sure talks like he's 50 years old. He does his fair share, but unfortunately that's all he does. Disappears after, and is rarely seen after five. Intentionally schedules all his classes together so he can pang gang earlier. Nobody knows anything about him, he just comes to school, does his part, gets stuff straight and goes home.

7. The Attached-Out Personnel
He's not really part of your clique anymore. He used to show up regularly, but not any more and he's more of a work friend than a real friend by now. Usually has his own group of friends on the side, which he's now ""attached"" to. He doesn't make an effort to meet you guys but you guys are still good. Still shows up to go out sometimes, but usually leaves jios on read or flies aeroplane on you guys. Bonus points if he's dating someone in the new group of friends. 

And the shiny pokemon...

8. The AWOL
You never know where he is, you never know what he's doing, and he doesn't even read, let alone reply, text messages. He just went home one day and that was the last you heard of him. You only intermittently hear of him appearing somewhere or you only see an empty seat during finals. Bonus points if he somehow manages to be still on the nominal row the next semester and you're just wondering how he's not slapped with an academic warning yet.

You might be one of them, you might be more than one of them, or you might be none of them. The only constant you know is that no matter what course you're in, you're going to hear about at least one Chao Keng.

If you don't, then I've got bad news for you."

85,62655,"Recently, NUS geography sent a “reassurance” email regarding the departure of several geography professors. Honestly not sure how I feel about this but surely, I don’t feel “so good” (or “assured”). I believe many of the Geography majors are also aware that this does not bring any good news or comfort. Some of our beloved and favourite professors are leaving NUS for good and we are deeply saddened. While it is clearly for the advancement in their careers, I am curious as to their motivations in leaving the institute and role of the university/department in any attempts to retain our best talents and professors. It feels like someone (“Thanos” maybe) just snapped and wiped them out. How can a department in the top 10 global ranking experience such drastic changes? 

Clearly, with the situation in the departmental office, there is bound to have some repercussions on the learning experience and opportunities (modules, research projects and HT) for students. No form of “assurance” is enough until we see the “promised” changes. Already, less and less modules are available for students over the year. Just look at the modules previously listed on the Geography department webpage and as a geography student you will already know that some of them are no longer offered. In addition, this also means that more students are competing for the remaining modules available whether by choice or not. Inevitably, this also have effects on class size and learning environments. Before taking a level-4000 module, I always thought that the classes will be different and more seminar-style like sessions similar to some of the higher level classes I have been on for exchange. However, I was easily proven wrong and the sheer size of the classes just meant that conducive learning environments for open discussions is difficult. 

Any students who have to face the fact that their department is losing some of their best professors will surely be saddened and disappointed. Maybe... “Some people move on, but not us”. These beloved professors will continue to hold a place in our hearts.

So much has be done more than promised. Nonetheless, going forward, existing and new incoming professors assembled by the department have to do whatever it takes to continue to maintain the standards and legacy set by the leaving professors. This is by no means an easy feat and I sincerely hope the best for the department."
86,62652,"I would love to get Prof Ben Leong or Jordan Mattson's advice here - How would you recommend dealing with companies that insist on seeing your payslips before they can proceed with a job offer?

I am have 10+ years of experience and have been interviewing for mid to senior roles in software engineering. I am in the late stages with a large finance / fintech firm, but they insist on knowing my current comp and seeing my payslips before they can proceed with an offer.

I make around 200 k in my current role as an engineering lead. Besides money, my job offers incredible autonomy. I pretty much get to dream up and execute projects on my own. I have amazing work life balance: I work remote 90% of the time and can easily fulfil expectations working 5-10 hours a week on average.   

In spite of these benefits, I have been looking for a role that is more senior and challenging. But I want to make sure that when I trade jobs, it's worth it in terms of compensation vs hours worked: and as such, I have been targeting roles that can pay around 350 - 400 k.

After many (8-10) rounds of interviews, pretty much everyone sees me as having the perfect background and skills for the new role. Early in the process, I confirmed with the (third-party) recruiter that the role does in fact have a budget of up to 400k.

Throughout the interview process, the recruiter was insistent on knowing my current compensation. They also emphasised that the company's standard policy is to pay an increment of say, 15-20%. I have successfully managed to deflect the question of my current salary up until now. 

The recruiter repeatedly ""warned"" me to keep my expectation in line with their increment range, and cited many candidates (for other roles in firms like this) who were asked for much more than the standard increment range and were promptly turned down. They repeatedly asked me for assurances that I'm not one of these candidates who is asking for a ""crazy"" increment.

At this point, I'm afraid that if I let them know my current comp, the deal will fall apart. As a data point, I interviewed with a different company in the same peer group as this one last year and made it to the offer stage. They insisted on seeing my payslips before making an offer, and sure enough they offered a 25% raise.

What are my options at this point? The difference between what I'm asking for and what I make is enormous, but my current situation in terms of work life balance is not reflected in my payslips.

96,62633,"I actually need some relationship advice, and no, it's not exactly the usual kind of r/s drama. My case is quite difficult, that's why I'm conflicted on what I should do. Let me start from the beginning. 

I met this girl at a bar last year, she was still in Singapore at that time. She is a uni student from the US, and she was just visiting as tourist with her friends. We befriended each other over the course of the 1 week she was here and I showed her around. Unfortunately, she had to return back to her country of course. Over the next few days we talked a lot through the phone and eventually, our friendship blossomed to romance (very prematurely, in hindsight). But as I got to know her more, I realized the she wasn't the one for me as I'm starting to lose interest in her (we do not like the same things, we can't keep up a conversation, we're not compatible basically). I'm starting to get bored too actually. Don't get me wrong, I believe that I CAN stand the distance, I'm actually a really patient guy. It's just that our incompatibility is making the distance more unbearable as each and every day I can feel her emotional connection slipping away from me. Take note, I realized that I don't like her as a girlfriend, but she makes a good friend. I still care about her.

Here's where the trouble comes in. 
I want to tell her all these things, right? I don't want to waste her time, and I don't want to waste my own time too. But I feel OBLIGED to stay with her. Why? Because 

1) She has already booked a plane ticket to see me in 4 months, by HERSELF. 

2) At the same time, I don't know if I can wait any longer because 4 months is a very long time. 

She said to me once, if I ever leave her she would just block me because she still loves me very much and it would hurt her. So asking if she could be my friend instead is out of the question. There is no way she could come to Singapore as a friend.

If I break things off with her now, what is she going to do? I don't want to waste her money for nothing. She still loves me a lot, I don't want her to come here by herself with a broken heart. 

Any advice on what I could do? Wait it out or break it off? "

The insurance said the car repair fee is less than 3k but the other party did full body check up and incurred 40k plus, including no pay leave etc. He claimed he got neck pain, back pain, butt pain, everywhere pain... so he did a lot checkup.

112,62607,"I recently interviewed a master engineering grad from one of the top local uni for my startup. Superb academic records on the cv and all the scholarships one could hope for. The cv was filled with several internship records too. I picked some of the internships and asked for more details, but there was no details. Said there wasn't much done at the internships. When asked about hands-on skills, there was none. Any project done as a student? ""Don't remember anything"". I was glad that at least the candidate didn't make anything up. ""I am willing to learn anything."" Said the candidate. We are a startup, I told the candidate, so not only we need someone who is better than us, but also you have to understand the extremely challenging work environment we are going to... ""Sorry what's a startup?"" The candidate interrupted. And it was at that point, I realized the conversation needed to end. I thought about this for days, and there is no one good way to explain my feeling about this. To list some of my thoughts: (1) If you seriously don't know what you want for a career, just sign up for the graduate hires at bigger and more established corporations or the public sector; they'll take you however useless you are as long as you show the grades. (2) Don't put things that you can't explain in your cv, unless you want to get destroyed quickly. (3) Many of the parents who told their child to focus on nothing but studies were from a different generation where uni graduates were kinda guaranteed decent jobs; most of them stay in their current jobs their entire adult life, and job hunting is something they never had to deal with. They do not understand the job market we are facing today, so please don't take updated career advice blindly."
113,62605,"Girl who posted #62605 here. I’m very happy in my current relationship. So nope, I’m not looking for anyone to PM or date me. But if you’re a SOC guy interested in a SOC girl who’s already told you she’s single and dropped you a few hints she may be interested, please stop waiting around and make a move already!

To #62642: If you don’t get why guys should take the initiative, it’s very simple. An average girl in uni usually has more than one guy interested in her at any one time. Some of these guys would be actively pursuing her, and taking up her time and attention away from you. Unless she has the opportunity to get to know you for an extended period of time (like what happened with me and my boyfriend), her interest in you would have already peaked and faded some time after meeting you. If you don’t make the 1st move, she might never get the chance to know you better. So if a guy wants to play the waiting game and wait for the girl to make the 1st move, good luck to him! If it happens, he’s a very lucky guy. 

To #62634: You sound like the typical sweet but hopeless/clueless SOC guy I mentioned before. If you’re trying to read and analyse your girlfriend like a computer program, please stop. Girls are more complex than just a bunch of 1s and 0s. Also not all communications are verbal. If your girlfriend is exasperated, it’s because you’re only paying attention to what she says, not what she communicates. There’s a difference. If she loves you enough, she’ll try to teach you. If you love her enough, you’ll try to learn. Good luck!"

I had it too. Actually at times there are still some symptoms here and there. I'm off medication already though. My advice would be to not just take medication but to look into psychotherapy or counselling at the very least. These will help teach you coping skills not dependent on medication. But of course don't stop your meds yet. Studies show having therapy in addition to meds actually helps recovery better. 

Be patient tho it may take months or years. And remember, however long it takes, it does not say anything about you as a person. Recovery time is different amongst individuals. Take care and all the best!"

120,62591,"As much as I am thankful for the counselling services provided by UHC, does anyone else feel like the help offered is very limited (time-wise)? In the sense that, only 6 sessions are offered per student for their entire candidature at NUS. This seems grossly insufficient for those suffering from mental illness and desperately need help but at the same time are bounded by the fact that they need to get better in 6 sessions or they are left to suffer alone. Furthermore, I doubt 6 sessions are sufficient for people who are severely suffering from depression or etc because obviously things have accumulated to the point where it has affected their mental stability. Given that NUS's global ranking is quite high, it is disappointing to see how little effort is put into helping students suffering from mental-illness. Shouldn't it be based on a case-by-case basis; meaning that if a person is having major depression, support should be given till the person recovers (rather than being forced to sign a form stating that only 6 sessions will be provided)? I get that it the counselling provided is only short term but this 6 sessions thing only works for those who aren't suffering severely from mental illness. 

And no, I don't fault the counsellors who work there because they are very overworked as it is. My point is, shouldn't NUS hire more counsellors to offer guidance for its students ; I mean a waiting time of 1.5 months for a first appointment (unless its an emergency, where you can walk in) seems a bit overboard and having maybe around 10-13 counsellors providing care for around 30 000 undergraduates seems a little insufficient? I've friends who underwent great psychological trauma but had to wait for 1.5 months to get help; because it wasn't an emergency per say but a very unfortunate incident. And to add on, the waiting time for following appointments are around a month? I know of so many people who gave up trying to get better because the gap was too long and just try to lead a normal life, with all that suffering. I've talked to friends from other unis and I don't think the waiting time for appointments are this long, and they are not limited to 6 sessions for their entire candidature. The number of sessions is dealt with on a case by case basis. I mean come on, isn't 6 sessions absurd for a person who is severely depressed? Even if it barely manages to help a person sort their issues out, there is definitely no opportunity for follow-ups (bc of the lack of sessions) to ensure that the person is coping well and won't fall back into that ditch. I feel that the NUS management is providing insufficient help in the area of mental health and that they really need to do something about it, especially with mental illness on the rise. Please look out more for our welfare, NUS.

(for those that suggest looking for help elsewhere, at charities offering counselling or etc bc its not as expensive, that's not the point. that should be a last case resort because every university should be able to provide adequate help for its students. The point is that the amount of help NUS is offering in the area of mental health is insufficient, and in fact much lower than that of other universities. go check out our local counterpart NTU, their counselling is stated to have sessions on a case by case basis; there's not restriction to the number of sessions offered)

tldr: counsellors in uhc are overworked. more counsellors should be employed to provide adequate help for students. and please provide sessions on a case by case basis rather than restrict it to 6 sessions from the start(cause this restricts recovery as well).if you're rational for 6 sessions is so that all students have an opportunity to receive help, please consider employing more resources; not cut back on the quality of help you are providing by restricting the number of sessions provided.

123,62588,"hi OP of #62588, trust me, you having feelings for another man other than your bf is completely normal. I experienced this 'problem' many times. In fact this problem of mine resulted in 3 failed relationships, all of which ended because I started having feelings for another guy. 

Every time I have such feelings, I would gradually end my relationship and then start a new one with the guy I have feelings for. I gave my all in all my relationships and they were all great loving guys whom I admired. 

As a weak human, I gave in to temptations. I loved all the care and attention given to me and being told how different or special I am to someone whom I find attractive too. I would always tell them I already have a bf and we would agree to hang out as friends. But eventually feelings grew and I had to put an end to my own rs. It's like a vicious cycle. That is until I met someone. 

That someone is none other than my current bf of 3 years. My bf is an average student with an average background and a very average life, which consists mainly of studying, gymming and gaming. 

Throughout these 3 years, of course there were temptation everywhere. They were friends of friends, colleagues, people you meet at events and even some old crush you had. 

That old crush was the most difficult one. Logically speaking, he's more attractive than my bf because he's like really smart, good-looking, and accomplished. He's also a very sweet guy who always listens to you and tries to be there for you, which explains why I had a crush on him back then. But silly me didn't go for it because I thought he was too good for me. 

One day he appeared at one of our group outings after many years abroad. He started texting me, wanting to catch up. Eventually he wanted to hang out. So we had dinner frequently. He offered a listening ear whenever I needed it. Until one day he actually told me he wants to date me. 

My crush wants to date me!? What!? He even confessed that he liked me a long time ago but I sort of rejected him many years ago (I stopped replying him because I thought he wouldn't like me anyway). 

Now, this beautiful man happens to be my old friend and also happens to like me and want to date me. Isn't this like a fairytale? 

SAD. Sad that life isn't a fairytale. I rejected my old crush again. Why? I could always end my rs and start a new one with this old crush. But I didn't. Because I simply cannot imagine a life without my boyfriend. 

My bf may not be the smartest or most good-looking guy I know but he's the sweetest guy I have ever seen. He may be an average guy but his love for me is nothing like average. When you meet someone like that, please cherish him. Treasure him. Never let go of him.

It's easy to meet someone you like but it's so damn hard to meet someone who would love you wholeheartedly. 

And for those who aren't sure if your bf is the one you want to marry, the moment I rejected my crush is the moment I know for sure I want to marry my bf.

Thanks Prof Aaron, for being so patient and opening up so many consultation slots to help us, even sacrificing your lunch timings. Definitely an unforgettable module!"
127,62582,"Well this is more of an advice to incoming students/those who have never stayed in hall on hall life. I am what people consider a phantom in hall, and don't really socialise, so as compared to those who really hype up hall, I hope to give another insight from a phantom's point of view.

I have stayed for a year and don't plan on staying due to personal reasons. I did it for the ""experience"" as everyone calls it because freshies are entitled to 1 year without any commitments once they get allocated a slot (so if you really want the experience, here's your chance). So I'll discuss some pros and cons for you all, to make this easier and hopefully help you come to a better conclusion. (This is in reference to halls, I can't really say the same about PGP/RC/Utown residences). 

Pros:
1) Very near to school, especially if you stay like really far away, school is within walkable distance/at max 30min away with the ISB.
2) Pillar modules - in NUS, you have to take general modules (GE mods). In which, GEQ and GER are commonly placed in the 1st sem. GER requires groupwork (at least for my syllabus) and it is very convenient to meet up for projects. 
2.1) Additionally, the tutorial is located within hall premises (provided you managed to secure that particular slot), so you can literally walk down in your PJs and go to class in about 2 minutes.
3) Communal living, for the boys, think of it as army life, where you get to see your friends everyday, perfect for those who want an escape from home, and loves to socialise.

Cons:
1) If you plan to stay for the 2nd year and onwards, you need to commit in hall activities to rack up points. No points = no stay, as simple as that, meaning to say you gotta give up some aspects of your life for this
2) Inconsiderate neighbours. I'll be honest, this is inevitable no matter where, but in a communal living space, it gets worst. Imagine neighbours screaming and shouting for God knows what reason at like 1am in the morning (occassionally gets into trouble for it, but still happens). And blasting of music that can be really annoying if you're trying to study. *Not recommended for people who really need peace and quiet to study.
3) Peer pressure. Okay, I'll say that its true that nobody in hall will force you to do anything. You can say really just say no, but they'll keep asking you to join them and stuff, and if you're really susceptible to peer pressure, its very easy to succumb to this.
4) Last minute ""events"" - well, I'm not in the planning committee of any of this events, but especially if you have other commitments out there, this is one big turn off, as they can literally give you finalised details of an event 2-3 days before it and expect you to show up. With relation to number 3, yes you can say no, but then you'll get ostracised and people will just stop inviting you to events. Kinda sad ain't it. (yes no pressure to joining, but well they still ostracise)
5) Reference to number 1 - only if you're planning to use hall for your GE modules, but, can get really annoying when setting a time and date for presentation, as 80% of those in hall will be trying to stay, so they are in a committee/activity in one way or another, and it's insanely hard to find a proper timing to meet, usually will be like at 12am, so if you aren't ready for this lifestyle.... don't.

That's kind of what I can think of for now, but I hope this provides another insight and help you decide on whether you wanna stay in a hall or not. Things to take note will be:
1) Hall culture - well, different halls have different cultures, and by asking your seniors/friends who have stayed in halls, you can get a better idea of whether it is good or not
2) Cost - its around 2k/sem, making it 4k/year. EXCLUDING vacation stay, so if cost is an issue, do avoid (there's financial assistance schemes though)
3) Food - it isn't exactly the best thing in the world, but its still edible, just that its cooked in bulk, so don't expect anything fancy

Goodluck for finals for those already in Uni, and all the best to those who are about to join us in NUS."
128,62581,"Hello, hopefully some NUS admin can see this? I really hope that the teaching surveys will be reposted after the finals because I have so much feedback (constructive ones!) to provide for my tutors/professors but I really don't have the extra time to type those out while cramming for the exams. 

Timing is really important and I hope that the NUS admin staff will take these feedback on how to improve the teaching survey system seriously! I discussed with a few other friends and many said they do want to contribute their opinions but simply don't have the time. We don't want to give shoddy feedback or randomly check numbers off the rating scale in a big hurry.

I'm sure even the nerdiest girl with braces, large specs, freckles and stammers at every sentence has had a guy confess to her before. 

Meanwhile a guy has to be a super social dude, and/or good-looking, know how to carry conversations, or super smart with an established future career, or/and rich already just to have any girl chase him.

However, the true question is if we value honest student feedback over a good rating for the modules. Have we perhaps considered the following?
1. Non-response bias from students who want value students who want to focus on their finals to save their CAPs rather than to improve the system (#62500)

2. Information bias from only selecting students when they have not been given the complete exposure to the module.

3. Selection bias from selecting people who are likely to give a more favorable (?) feedback having not been traumatised by finals.

Weighing all these against the potentially intensified responses which could pull down the overall module rating, the focus of the feedback is pretty evident.
If honest feedback is not sought after in the first place, I as a student, see no point in participating in the feedback exercise.

158,62510,"In today's GEH1036 exam, I arrived late but left early. Invigilator told me to put my exam paper face down and leave. After I reached home, I got slightly paranoid about an edge case where my paper flew away and nobody would know because my attendance might not have been taken since I arrived late. 


- Will the department call a student if he/she did not turn up for exam?
- Will the department call the student if the paper was lost and attendance was taken?

Need some advice on what to do:

1. Reach out to the Mathematics department/Prof to check if my paper was collected.
2. Don't do anything. I still have the question paper (completely filled up) as proof that I have attended the examination."

163,62500,"For those saying that the student feedback being put directly before finals is for the fact that difficult finals might pull the overall rating of the module down, I see where you're coming from.

However, the true question is if we value honest student feedback over a good rating for the modules. Have we perhaps considered the following?
1. Non-response bias from students who want value students who want to focus on their finals to save their CAPs rather than to improve the system (#62500)

2. Information bias from only selecting students when they have not been given the complete exposure to the module.

3. Selection bias from selecting people who are likely to give a more favorable (?) feedback having not been traumatised by finals.

Weighing all these against the potentially intensified responses which could pull down the overall module rating, the focus of the feedback is pretty evident.
If honest feedback is not sought after in the first place, I as a student, see no point in participating in the feedback exercise.

Food for thought: If finals were that impactful on student opinion, perhaps they aren't fair to begin with?"

176,62460,"With all the (supposed) girls from SoC coming out to say that you can't find a boyfriend in SoC, let me say that as a guy in SoC we have a simple rule of thumb when it comes to any girl we meet (assuming a heterosexual relationship):

If the girl is attractive in anyway to us, be it physically, emotionally, personality, and etc. she's probably attached so most decent guys won't make a move. This often rings true; most guys make this assumption unless told otherwise... Then prepare for an onslaught of sausages as the guys will stash their code and commit for you.

Else, the likely truth is that the girl is simply unattractive, batshit crazy, or a lesbian that has zero interest in guys, which is why no guy is making any advances. Minus the lesbian part, it's the same exact reasons as to why certain guys still can't get hitched or a date. 

The best first two steps to mitigate unattractiveness and get a partner in SoC and anywhere else on this planet:
1. Be attractive.
2. Don't be unattractive.

If you have already satisfied these 2 steps, then simply wait or start making some advancements on the guy/girl. Else, keep trying to make yourself attractive in some way.

185,62447,"#62438: You're confusing double degree and double Major a bit there! If you do a double major, you only get one degree - i.e., a Bachelors in Something. Then, you take a second major consisting of about 48MCs (credits), which is on average 12~ modules. A single degree requires 160MCs which is taken over 8 semesters, so while you do need to overload for a few semesters, 48 extra MCs is (comparatively) doable. Compared to a double degree, I mean :)

A double degree is when you graduate with two Bachelors degrees (in most double degree programs, it's two Bachelors). So, if one degree needs 160MCs, you need to take double that. That's why people doing a double degree take 5 (or even 6) years to graduate and overload on most semesters. 

Last option is doing a minor. From what I recall, a minor is 24MCs. That means you need to do about 6 modules, which is completely doable since you have what are called unrestricted electives. A minor might not give you the expertise that a double degree or major has, but you can still explore different areas.

So I'm guessing that the number of credits required at SMU might be slightly different, but I believe they have a similar distinction between a double degree and major as well. "

I been talking to and meeting up with Girl A for a few months now. I've enjoyed our meetings, and I would say she sweeps me off my feet. Whenever we meet she'll have a lot of interesting stories to share. One could say she's my dream girl, but when I'm with her I don't really feel completely at ease if I'm to be honest. I always feel like I have to be on my guard, and the ""best"" version of myself.

Then there's Girl B. We've known each other for longer, and we have good banter. I feel so comfortable when I'm with her, like I can express myself freely and openly, and basically be my true self. I wouldn't say she sweeps me off my feet, but I would definitely consider her.

Is love supposed to be like things are with Girl A? Where you feel this sense of euphoria each time, but also feel constrained in your interactions with her? If I continue going out with Girl A, will this lack of feeling at ease get better, and will I eventually warm up to her and become more comfortable with spending time with her? Or is love closer to what I described with Girl B, someone who could be your best friend at the onset? Who you can be yourself around, but perhaps doesn't ignite in you the same sense of anticipation or euphoria as Girl A? "
188,62440,"I think amidst all the negativity surrounding recent issues, let me say something positive :) I am a history student in Dr Wang Jinping's Imperial Chinese History Module this semester and I absolutely adore her lessons. Her interesting take on how history should be taught and viewed inspired me to want to continue taking History as a Major. 

For example, every tutorial in the semester we look at history in a different way/source. One tutorial we did debates between confucian scholars and government officials, understanding the dynamic relationship between the clergy and the scholars. In another tutorial we looked at a famous scroll painting which depicted life in Tang China and examined how we can better understand history via these lenses. 

Her modes of assessments are also very interesting and contribute greatly to my understanding of the subject. For instance we have an Individual Passion Project that we are allowed to creatively (in whatever way we wish to) express our understanding. Ive seen some of my peers even do imperial chinese history memes for the project, some wrote poems, some even designed games and infographics! We also had a group project that forced us to work together to present a SKIT in class! Among all the group projects I had this semester I think this was the most fun preparing for and performing in!

The best part about Dr Wang is that she never fails to relate what we do (assessments, tutorials etc) to how we can better view, learn and appreciate history. Through her classes I not only better appreciate History, but also the pedagogical approaches to the teaching of the subject. I believe that all classes should be as fun as and as educational as hers! Fellow students past and present of Dr Wang's classes, what do you think?

p.s. yes, I have also submitted my module feedback to commend her on this."

Do not be disheartened. I am somewhat like you. I do not have any material wealth to speak of. I come from an extremely humble background, my family were homeless for a few years even and we sought refuge under the roofs of relatives.

That being said, it wasn't all that bad. I mean, I'm here in Asia's best university aren't I? I somehow beat the odds but I had a lot of help along the way.

Also, I have been dating someone from a background that could not be more different than mine. She comes from an extremely wealthy family. And yet she chose me, someone who came from nothing.

She told me that she was attracted to me because of the fact that I am a person of strong character. Guess what? It was precisely because of the long years of hardship and uncertainty that had annealed me into this person. (So make your unfortunate circumstances count)

However, while the 2 parties may be happy with each other, people will say things. Nasty things. Especially if one party is not only poor but of a race that is stereotyped as ""cannot make it one"". You'll have people saying to her ""are you sure he's that intelligent?"" (because intelligence is only accorded to the upper echelons of society right) or ""people who are *my race* cannot make it one la"" or just about anything to do with race or SES.

There are industries where you don't even need a degree to get into, for example, programming (before I get flamed, this statement doesn't mean that a CS degree is useless; it makes getting into a good company exponentially easier) or insurance. As a personal experience, I did industrial software dev after graduation even though I did not have a CS degree.

205,62395,"Long post, just wanted to share my story. With regards to a certain post about the “bumping”, whether accident or not, I’ve been wondering to what extent the bumping should be to warrant a report? I’ve actually experienced it twice in the past - when I was much younger wearing in my school uniform going back home and I was just scared shitless and froze on the spot. The first time I tried to move away but he continued moving towards me (across the cabin, train was quite empty) and the adults around witnessed this and didn’t even say anything. I just prayed that my stop would come asap. Second time was on a crowded train, I was standing at the corner near the entrance and there was a guy in front of me. Every time the train jerked a little bit, his body would bump against mine fully, and he’ll stay on me a tad bit too long. I thought it was accident bumping but it happened so many times within the 2 stops and even though I was holding a thick file trying to push him off every time he lands on me, he still does it. I didn’t dare to speak up again because - what if it was on accident? what if it was because people were pushing him from behind? 

After reading my experiences, and assuming I reported it to police will the guys bumping against me get punished? Or let off with a warning? I was so traumatised as a kid and scared to say anything and hoping that the adults around me would say something but nobody did. If this happened again I would definitely try to call him out but should I bother reporting him to the police? "

215,62362,"Hi. Once this post has gone up, if it gets picked to be posted, I think most of my friends will know who I am but oh well. Here goes.

It has something to do with careers. After graduation I held a perm job at an established healthcare organisation, but due to unforseen circumstances, I left the job 4 months later. Then I frantically searched for a new job but could not find one. So I settled on a part time contract job in customer service while searching for a full time. Fast forward 4 months later till today, my contract is up and I'm still searching for a full time position. 

The thing is, there is an organisation that seemed interested in hiring me, and I was quite relieved. Yet at that point in time my reply was that I was still going for interviews and asked if I could be given more time. Now after my contract ended, and I still couldn't find a perm job, I wrote back to the organisation to ask if the position is still available. 

Till now, I got no reply. I'm wondering if the liaising personnel is irritated by my moves or that he is just busy with other stuff or that he is on leave or mc. I was hesitant to call him these few days too. 

After discussing this with my friends, one of them told me that in the first place, my way of communicating with the HR showed that I'm hesitant about taking the job and that it's not my first choice. Then he went on to ask if I am really interested in it and can see the job align with my goals and wants. To be honest, I'm torn between 2 sides. First side is that I cannot stand being unemployed and useless around the house, though I'm taking an online course and doing something, the other side is that the job does not seem like a fit with my goals. 

I'm stuck. I really am. Should I go for goals or should I look towards the monetary side of things and earn money first? Fyi I graduated last year."

217,62359,"Are B-grades really considered as 'mediocre' and pathetic here? I thought I was doing pretty well with a CAP of around 4.0 with mostly B's. I literally cheered when I see I got a B+.

I thought my CAP is satisfactory as it is. B grades were all I ever aimed for in Asia's top university. Jeez, my family even clap for me when I am so much as able to get B+. C grades are fine too if the module is freaking hard.

And no, I don't come from a top prestigious JC so my expectations were never set high. I was just happy enough to land a spot in NUS.  Are A-grades considered the norm here? The expectations by my peers of me? I seriously don't get it.

222,62334,"My girlfriend got ""bumped""  into by an old man and she didn't feel comfortable about it. It wasn't the usual kind of bump against the shoulder which I'm all too familiar with.

While my girlfriend may have experienced a legitimate bump, we can't discount the fact that it's possible for someone to make a ""bump with a motive"". Some quick googling led me to find cases where air stewardesses facing this and a boyfriend landing into jail for assaulting someone who allegedly ""bumped"" into his girlfriend.

Going along this logic, it's actually possible for someone to molest a lot of women and actually get away scot-free.

As a boyfriend, I would love to know what's the most appropriate way to deal with this. If I involve the police, I 'd expect little or no action taken due to the lack of evidence. If I treat old man a knuckle sandwich, i'd be landing myself into jail. If I let this go too often, both my girlfriend and I would be questioning my ability to protect her. 

But as a male myself, I would hate it if I legitly bumped into a female accidentally and she screamed molest on me.

What's the best course of action should our society to take to protect our loved ones from ""accidental bumps"" without giving us males any trouble? Is legislation even possible for such scenarios?"
223,62331,"To the OP of #62331

Do not be disheartened. I am somewhat like you. I do not have any material wealth to speak of. I come from an extremely humble background, my family were homeless for a few years even and we sought refuge under the roofs of relatives.

That being said, it wasn't all that bad. I mean, I'm here in Asia's best university aren't I? I somehow beat the odds but I had a lot of help along the way.

Also, I have been dating someone from a background that could not be more different than mine. She comes from an extremely wealthy family. And yet she chose me, someone who came from nothing.

She told me that she was attracted to me because of the fact that I am a person of strong character. Guess what? It was precisely because of the long years of hardship and uncertainty that had annealed me into this person. (So make your unfortunate circumstances count)

However, while the 2 parties may be happy with each other, people will say things. Nasty things. Especially if one party is not only poor but of a race that is stereotyped as ""cannot make it one"". You'll have people saying to her ""are you sure he's that intelligent?"" (because intelligence is only accorded to the upper echelons of society right) or ""people who are *my race* cannot make it one la"" or just about anything to do with race or SES. This is when you really need to know yourself (where you come from and what you are) and to acknowledge that others probably would not accept this union due to their own selfish reasons."
224,62322,"Still laughing as I'm typing.

So earlier today, I got this call from a company which I interviewed with for their marketing role a few months back.

THEY WERE FUUUUUUURIOUS! Here's the story.

I'm still taking my Degree so I don't have much to show in my resume (except for having a direct mentorship/collab with some of the marketing personalities/giants around the world) compared to other candidates and a strong freelance portfolio.

BUT then again, I do not have that piece of paper yet.

There was a total of three person interviewing me. From their choice of words and body language and how my paper was placed, I knew that I've wasted my printer ink and showing them testimonials from names that  they can't appreciate.

Finally, one of them asked, ""I have this ____ product, tell me how would you market it?""

Yo, I have been a freelancer, they have not paid me. So I went on to tell them a legit plan while leaving out the important parts, confidently, since I know my own creation well. All three of them were intrigued to the point that you can almost see the stars in their eyes.

""We will get in touch with you."" That was the last I ever heard from them. Before leaving, I took away the last few pages of my resume out of their copies, I don't like to have my mentors names to be in a pile. It's, to me, a sign of disrespect. My works can be in there, but never my mentors.

I think they invested quite a bit into this strategy thus the representative was quite furious over the phone. 

I'm not sure about how you interviewers will think of me (I don't care for your opinions if you're like the company in the story), but hey, is your recruitment drive just a channel for FREE IDEA GENERATION?

If you want something, you pay for it.

For students or future jobseekers, please, I IMPLORE y'all to be smart about it. I have known of IT companies holding recruitment drives and let the candidates solve their current issue and ultimately, hired no one.

Don't put yourself on the losing end.

p.s. If they have hired me, I'd have definitely put my name on the line to fill up the holes in the plan and realise it."

Silent wondering, if perhaps one year from now the exact same thoughts are running through the minds of the next graduating batch.

226,62317,"A couple of quick points that I think are worth noting from the recent voyeurism incident.

First, justice isn’t constrained to retribution. There are other principles of justice such as deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, and restoration – retribution is but one of such principles. This has been rightly pointed out by NUSSU which noted that NUS places greater weight on rehabilitation given that it is an educational institution. Bear in mind that there is no suggestion that rehabilitation should be the primary focus for all institutions – only that it is the focus of NUS. Other institutions (such as the SPF) are better placed to dish out retribution. 

Second, assuming that retribution should be the primary focus (which clearly is not for NUS), there are questions as to (1) who can dish out such punishment (2) what the scope of such punishment should be. It is not for the public to be judge, jury and executioner all at once. It is not on the public to play vigilante – a bit at no risk to themselves and oftentimes nothing more than virtue signalling – or to be part of a lynch mob. Furthermore, punishment should be just and appropriate. While many commentators have kept this in mind (indeed this is their complaint – that the punishment is unfair), there are others like Rice Media which has gone on to suggest that NUS should not study the approaches of other institutions and “the only feedback they should listen to is the victim’s”. The ridiculousness of the above statement should be apparent to all – taking the author’s premise to its logical end would mean that readers who have to bear with Rice Media’s typo or grammatical errors are entitled to call for the website to shut itself down. 

Third, what is unfair punishment? It’s a rather difficult concept to grapple with; most of us base this off our intuition. I would suggest to you that there has been no procedural unfairness or impropriety in the way NUS handled the situation – they rightly convened a disciplinary hearing and did not stop the victim from reporting the perpetrator to the police. The only unfairness appears to be in the substance – that the perpetrator did not get the punishment he deserved. This is a justified concern, but it bears remembering that NUS does not concern itself solely with retribution; rather, rehabilitation is their focus. My guess is that a lot of us would be a lot more content with NUS’ decision if the perpetrator had actually been charged – one term suspension wouldn’t seem so bad since the perpetrator got his “just desserts”. But this does not concern NUS at all – the question is why and how prosecutorial discretion has been exercised in the manner it was. 

Fourth, what happens even if we collectively agree that a suspension is too light a punishment? Should the perpetrator’s punishment be increased then? The answer intuitively appears to be a resounding ‘yes’ but I would again suggest that the answer should be in the negative. NUS dished out such punishment in accordance with precedent and their own guidelines; one will find remarkable consistency in the (light) punishments they have meted out to those who have committed sexual offences. However, should we alter punishments and apply them retrospectively to a perpetrator? What happens when we allow this to happen? Article 11(1) of our Constitution states that “No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.” I note that administrative guidelines do not necessarily amount to law, but I will suggest that the same principle behind Article 11 applies in this case. 

This does not mean however that we should all keep quiet and let the incident fade into our distant memories. We should be calling for change. But the point of such change isn’t retribution of change. Even as the victim notes, change should be for the future, to ensure that we have better policies in place. 

Last, I should add that I sympathise with the harm suffered by the victim, and in no way condone what the perpetrator has done. A disclaimer like this should not be necessary but I don’t think I should take any chances. This is NUSWhispers after all.

Hmm are they trying to justify that it is not that they could not attend the school but that they didn't want to? I wonder what's the point in doing so. And then there's that other person who just keep criticising or mocking the school without giving any useful comments. I can't deny that I'm particularly annoyed by these people because I'm a student from NUS.

NUS President apologises: ""He should step down!"",  ""NUS is a disgrace!"", ""Too late for apology!"". How are your comments of any use? If you believe in helping the victim, why don't you give some constructive comments? I believe that the school's current disciplinary measures are less than satisfactory but right now, shouldn't we take a step back and give them a chance to work on it? To be honest, there are probably many other institutions who are lacking in this aspect as well. Instead of constantly picking on what NUS did wrong, why don't these people start looking at it from an overall viewpoint and give some useful suggestions so that we can improve the situation in Singapore?

230,62291,"Hi all, so with all the hype regarding the recent saga surrounding the issue of misconduct, I've decided to jump onto the bandwagon and just share my two cents worth on this issue.

First, it's reading week with finals just round the corner. So, guys, please be the good university students you're supposed to be (or at least everyone else thinks so) and start studying your entire semester's worth of course materials within these last few days. You don't want to find yourself in the position where you are sitting in the exam hall, staring at the question paper and feeling the sudden, irrepressible urge to peep at those around you (especially at those that may catch your eyes). You are liable for your own actions as adults.

Second, if/when caught, as (hopefully) mature adults, please accept the punishment meted out with dignity. Please don't start putting the blame onto the deanery or any other bodies that is/are responsible for investigating the event and meting out the appropriate punishments. While some may argue that the punishments are inadequate, there are those who would think otherwise. Honestly, it is just impossible to please everyone.

Third, please stop victim- and/or perp-shaming, saying that it's his/her fault that made you wanna peep or that they are trying to gain fame through shame. With all due respect, you could have avoided this if you had just done what you're supposed to do - be a good university student. 

So yeah, with that, I wish you all the best in the upcoming finals.

Cheers.

Also, international students literally cannot apply to any NOC scholarship. I understand why several Government scholarships require you to be a citizen or a PR but these scholarships are administered by NUS, so why are international students not eligible?

To those who have supported Monica since the start of the saga, it was admirable of you to stand up for the victimised. Those who spoke up for Nicholas, it was also worthwhile to let others see things from a different perspective. 

And to those condeming NUS, I think you should stop. NUS has reasons for adopting the 'two-strikes-and-out' approach. It is an educational teaching to always give second chances to individuals. So don't blame NUS for it. Yes, the punishment is inadequate, because there is no fine line drawn between each erroneous acts. 

If voyeurism constitutes immediate expulsion, does rape invite a death sentence? How about minor acts such as vandalism, does it lead to immediate expulsion too? The thing is, NUS could have had it easy, any mistakes (cheating in an assignment/exam, smoking in school premises, acts of vandalism, sexual assaults etc.) will just lead to immediate expulsion. Criminal acts will then be referred to the law. 

That would have solved today's problem. 
 
Attend the townhall on Thursday, raise your concerns and suggestions there, let your voice be heard. The ongoing debates are not going to help much in Monica's cause. Social media is just a platform to let us share and have our freedom of speech, I'm not stopping you, but chances of having relevant authorities and institutional bodies reading all our opinions on the matter is really limited.

243,62223,"Some of us have been barking up the wrong tree. I believe that before we can even consider if a punishment is too ""harsh"" or ""lenient"", we must first of all consider whether the punishment for this and prior cases in NUS were on par with those outside NUS. Because if there is even no parity in the punishment, then it is meaningless to argue whether rehab or other measures are more effective or not. Then in parallel the NUS should (and have already) started reviewing their internal punishments, but this must be completely separate from the SPF (specifically to student's entitlements to loans and housing + candidature suspension or termination). So instead of going after NUS alone we should be campaigning for the SPF to review which cases go up to prosecution and which are not, and the SPF should not take into account whether this occured inside an institution with a BOD-level of jurisdiction or not. Unfortunately as with past precedences, any changes in punishments cannot be retroactively applied.

Lastly, the trolls calling her out for seeking public attention should stop their antics. If not for her, these things will continue to perpetuate and if this didn't get blown up none of us will be here calling for real action. If you want to go after people, go after those vigilantes in HWZ spreading all sorts of speculations.

In the end, I just have to break up with him because what he wants - he has other fetishes as well - is just something that I cannot give him, and sex may not be everything about a relationship, but it’s one big part of it.

You end up having to change yourself to suit his tastes, and you are very likely going to be unhappy in the long run. I’ve been through it myself.

250,62194,"FOREVER SINGLE. GIVE UP ON LOVE.

It’s pretty funny when I see the profile of some of the people who commented on posts with themes of being ‘forever single’ & ‘being a looser’.

You click into their profile and they look exactly the way you would imagine him to- a socially awkward Otaku that posts about how lonely he is.

Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against Otakus or being socially awkward. But post after post about being lonely, giving up on finding a partner, being called a creep by other girls.etc. It almost feel like these people are so comfortable in their self-pity that it’s all the reality they know.

I know life isn’t fair. Some of us are born better looking, or healthier, or richer or whatever & if you are going to argue based on natural selection- the fittest, the best genes procreate & survive then yes y’all have all the reason in the world to wallow yourself in your self pity.

 But at the end of the day, this is not a hunting ground and we are not barbarians. We are all civilised being in a civilised society trying to find meaning, Joy & trying to live life.

So to those of y’all out there that constantly complain about being lonely & ugly & whatever, I have tips for y’all:

1)Think about who you are trying to attract & then consider who those people are attracted to? Who do you think are attracted to you? How can you become someone they are attracted to? [Then start working on them. Be the man of your dreams.]

2)Shut up. All your whining doesn’t really do too much for you- it’s also terrible branding. Because now you are known as the weird guy who goes around telling people how pitiful he is.

3)Work on yourself. Like if you spent 1 hour per day in the gym instead of wallowing in self pity. You would have at least look better and feel better by the time you are done working out. 

4)Don’t look like a such a ‘looser’. Spent money, buy clothes that makes you feel good and look good. Don’t know how? Pinterest, Google,YouTube. Tons of resources at your disposal- the question is do you want to work on yourself?

5)Learn. Just as you would do so if you were weak in a subject. Go learn how to interact with people, learn charisma, learn how to be an interesting individual that draws life to himself. Watch charisma on command, read 12 rules of life by Jordan Peterson. Ask people you look up to how they did it. There are plenty of resources!

I know it’s hard being you. But working on it rather than complaining about it is almost always better. It’s never too late to be the better version of yourself. So stop being such a whiny bitch and go do something about it. Your life is yours to live. Jiayou."

- No, in fact, he encourages me to date other men, especially men my age. Exclusivity is not a term between us. However, I have never being in a proper BGR, my experiences has always been with SDs and lovers. Should I have a BF, I would want to be faithful to him. 
- Arrangements either goes by monthly allowances or Pay Per Meet. Personally, I only accept monthly payments. He provides for my living expenses and tuition fees. Though I have a proper part time job drawing $1k monthly while studying, it's insufficient. 
- Not always. I know a particular dude who was once a high end male escort and had women taking care, grooming him to be a successful (wealthy) individual. Now, he's 'paying forward' to help girls out ???? But I have to say such cases are rare especially for a male. He's charming and intellectual to begin with, he just get resources in such a quicker method. 
Am lucky to meet my current SD and we've been together for 1.5years. Neither the wealthiest nor most good looking, but well off and decent looking. Respectful and caring so far. We do activities together: swimming, reading books, having McD at 3am. I have met public figures before and most are petty douchebags!

252,62171,"Regardless of where you stand on the recent sexual harassment issue, I hope that people won't resort to saying things like well think about what this punishment will do to the perpetrator, 'what if he kills himself?' etc. Mental illnesses are a serious issue and I'm tired and disheartened to see that people just use it as a card to get away with things. I'm not saying I want him to kill himself or anything here. I'm saying that this is a horrible way to explain giving him a light sentencing. If you use this as a reason to explain giving people a light sentence, then it can apply to every case, right? So should we just ignore someone's wrongdoing and not address it because doing so will just cause them to kill themselves? Even more disheartening to see an actual proff taking this stance to justify the uni's actions.

Honestly, the issue here is about responsibility. We're all adults and we live in the 21st century. If I did something bad to someone else, I have to accept that even if I'm truly sorry about what I did to them, they are not obligated to accept my apology. If they decide to name and shame me on their social media/to their social circles, then, of course, it would put me in a bad situation, but it would be something that I can't get angry with them about because I was clearly in the wrong. Plus, think about why she named him in the first place. This was before the incident went viral on social media. All the school did was ask him to write a letter of apology, and suspend him for a semester (during which he actually got work experience). In the bigger picture, the punishment was nothing compared to the mental trauma inflicted on the victim.

tl;dr: mental illnesses are not a way to justify light sentences and you are not allowed to be annoyed that your victim didn't react the way you wanted."

259,62146,"Regarding the recent peeping tom incident. Here's an interesting observation: most netizens agree that the sentence should be harsher, but few dare state how much harsher they think it should be.

This is pretty important (think about it).

Suppose the fair sentence is marginally greater than the actual sentence, for example 24 months warning/probation versus the actual 12 months. Then it is quite possible that current social justice efforts are overdone.

Clearly there is an upper bound for harsh sentencing. I don't think it is fair to impose the death sentence or lifetime imprisonment for the culprit, for example.

Finally, it is only mature and morally correct to state one's ""price"" in a negotiation. This only needs to be done based one's best ability (e.g. a range/interval might be sufficient). In this case, an upper bound for the culprits sentence.

Otherwise you'd most likely end up in a trap (despite good intentions), where you are either: never satisfied, or just another cry baby seeking maximum revenge. "

261,62143,"I'm a woman and I feel sorry for the Nicholas guy in the Monica Baey saga. Don't get me wrong - I'm not affiliated with Nicholas in anyway, nor do I think what Monica did was wrong or attention seeking or all those things the (horrible) (male) commenters are saying (everytime I read these kind of comments I feel sick). I just think that the perpetrator's current fate - having his face plastered all over the Internet with his army details and IC details and job details, even his (innocent?) girlfriend's face open for everyone to see - is a fate much much worse than if he had suspended longer, expelled, or even sentenced to jail for the what the 1 week that offenders usually seem to get. The system might be too lax for offenders, and that is something that the new Penal Code is already changing and NUS should also work towards, but his current situation is more akin to a public stoning. What more of his girlfriend, his family and his friends' who didn't do anything and now can no longer show their faces in public. The purpose of a jail term, or other sanctions, is to appropriately punish the offender, but then also to rehabilitate him and for him to change and move on with his life. If he doesn't change, then the system (is supposed to) punish him again. 

I blame NUS and the police force for this. If they had just handled the situation properly in the first place, it would not be such a fiasco as it stands now. If a 1 term suspension and a warning is the standard precedent for such first time offenders, they should have at least communicated this to Monica and the school, or have the guidelines and disciplinary committee procedure online for everyone to read. Taking Monica's word for it, they did not bother to involve the victim in the process at all or care about her welfare. And they should have provided avenues for Monica and other members of the community to feedback if anyone felt measures were not sufficiently taken, instead of forcing her to engage in this witch hunt just to get any answers at all. Nicholas committed an offence, a crime even - but ultimately his lame apology letter and one semester suspension was just what the school asked him to do, and the lack of police prosecution. He is being crucified not just for his crime, but for the problems of the entire system. 

The heart of the problem is NUS's - and perhaps Singapore's - culture of paternalism and arrogance. The authority always knows best, there is no transparency or opportunity for feedback or change, so much so that they don't bother about keeping the victim informed of what is happening - one email only?? How is that right - - or give the victim and the school community options to feedback for change. Its about keeping everything under wraps, saving face, and not telling anyone anything because students are stupid and don't know any better than school admin. And this is evidenced by their first statement about this matter ""we will convene a committee and get back to you next academic year""? There's not even an attempt to bother to address the public's concern. I'm willing to give NUS the benefit of the doubt that some investigation and disciplinary procedures are in place and were carried out, even if they may not be ideal. If they had just come out to share this, then the next issue is moving to improve these systems, rather than the state and flak they're receiving now. 

Serves NUS right that it all is blowing up in their face. Pity for Nicholas that he is nothing more than a scapegoat for the system's incompetence. "

I have been catching up with such news a lot from forums like HWZ, NUSWhispers, the Strait Times, responses, comments etc. Based on what I have read, a lot of responses seem to be revolving about demanding a harsher punishment because the punishment is not a good deterrent enough, which I do agree.

What I don't get it is few responses mention about improving the security in halls. I am an alumni from NUS, never stayed in NUS halls before so I don't know about the state of security in NUS halls. But from what I gather, firstly, the perpetrator himself is not even a resident from the hall. Secondly, the perpetrator went toilet to toilet to look for a victim, which gives me the impression he was not caught in act for some period of time (lets assume like 10 minutes). It seems like there is a security breach on the part of NUS halls.

While harsher punishments is a form of deterrent, shouldn't increasing of security in hall (more patrols etc) be an equal deterrent to be emphasized as well? "
264,62119,"Many people are talking about forgiveness and rehabilitation for Nicholas but fail to realize that these can only come after a commensurate punishment has been dealt to him. When the punishment given to him is not strict and people are jumping ahead and discussing the avenue for rehabilitation, something is clearly wrong. That’s not forgiveness, that’s foolishness. Think about if, what kind of message are you sending out to your students if your punishment for voyeurism is simply writing some letters, doing some CIP, taking some time off, and going for some counselling? The punishments given by the authorities is another (even thornier) matter that cannot be an excuse for the light sentencing given by NUS. While I think Nicholas shouldn’t be expelled over a moment’s folly, I do think harsher sentences like longer suspensions (at least 1-2 years) are needed from NUS.

I’m not a fan of taking justice into one’s own hands, but if you have been let down by both NUS and the police, then relying on social justice is just about your only option left, other than of course, do what you have been told and accept what is given. I’m all for rehabilitation of Nicholas too, but the fact of the matter is that Nicholas was not punished appropriately in the first place. His sentence was too light to offer any form of justice to Monica. And till that changes, Monica is more than justified in doing what she has done to rally for change on this matter from either the police or NUS. The forgiveness and sympathy talk can wait till after he has shown some semblance of public unforced remorse for his actions.

TLDR: people seem to be confusing calls for justice with calls for revenge. Given the way the situation has played out, the notion that Monica is out to harm Nicholas is simply unfounded and is perhaps the source of some way-too-early calls for forgiveness."
265,62114,"I am crafting this post amidst preparations for finals. The stress is boiling in me so please pardon my grammatical errors, if any. 

I don't usually take to posting on confessions seeking advice as I always felt it was difficult for people to relate and hence, understand my situation. Even, if they do, it's too long a story to fully grasp the gravity of what I went through. 

However, I am at wit's end and really don't know what to do from here onwards. 
I have tried to read the confessions posted here to see if there are any similar situations but none, unsurprisingly. 

My earliest memories of my parents were pleasant ones, being devoted, loving and committed to each other as well as to me. I started living with them only in my later teen years, and I found out the hard way as to why I was raised by my extended family. My father had been retrenched and refused to find employment (I was only in primary school then) and my mother was reluctant to support us and hence I was sent away to live with my grandparents while she recovered from depression. But ever since then, she deeply resented me and blamed me for all the bad things my father did. My father was irresponsible and leeched off not just from my mother, but his own mother as well. Constantly demanding money from a frail, old woman of 70plus years. As a child, seeing this supposed role model check off all the things a role model should NOT do, my moral compass was broken.

I was extremely suicidal by sixteen but that was the year of O Levels and I was determined to use education as a ticket to move out and get out because I flooded my mind with messages of motivational videos from people who came from broken homes. My school counselor told me to channel my energy into doing well, and that's what I did. Eventually scoring 10 points from an initial prelim score of 30+. 

I was neither the bright nor dumb but had a deep passion for subjects I was interested in. I knew education was my ticket out but I was feeling demotivated seeing their faces every single day. The feeling was eating me up alive, every day it felt like a constant reminder as to why I am a failure. 

Feeling trapped, I decided to find a sugar daddy because there was no way I could get out of my situation without the help of someone to pull me out of it. I was only eighteen. 

Fast forward to today, I found myself stuck in this situation again because I recently let go of my sugardaddy of two years. Despite having him helped me tremendously, I had to let him go because he abused other girls behind my back and I was in a beggars-cannot-be-choosers dilemma because staying with him meant having finances taken care of but at the expense of being together with a sexual predator. 

It was difficult but I couldn't stand it anymore. I didn't want to entertain the thought of him preying on his next eighteen year old. I didn't want to defend his actions anymore. 

The purpose of this post is to see if there are others out there like me, and if so what steps do you take to prevent yourself from falling back into depression/ suicide. Or how do you overcome a situation like this with or without the help of a sugardaddy. 

I am on the highest tier of financial aid (I explained to the school my situation), and am working on days I do not have school. Hostel is not an option for me because it is too expensive.

266,62111,"Regarding Ms Baey's case, why is everyone arguing about NUS being a disciplinary body or not? Hell ya it is! NUS has the power to discipline isn't it? Then where do you get all the suspension detention from? NUS cannot go into criminal record. We agree. But shouldn't NUS discipline students that did wrong? Especially in Nicholas Lim's case. Sexual harassment is not something funny. The damage is severe. The ATTITUDE of NUS is just bad at dealing it, hoping that people keep quiet about their pain. And still people are arguing if NUS should or should not discipline its students... 

Stay strong Ms Baey. I do support you on correct NUS's attitude on this. We cannot change the judge decision and there can be many reasons for his judgement, but we do believe that NUS needs to put in a proper attitude for sexual harassment. Whether you want fame or not (like what many other people are suspecting), is not the focus of this whole discussion. Even if your fame might come as a by-product, but what we want is NUS making a better change.

How far should a university’s disciplinary board go in a criminal matter?

I believe many people have read about a current female NUS student’s (let’s call her Ms M) recount of the horrible criminal act that was committed against her when a male student used his handphone to film her while she was showering. It is a horrible experience which, in the words of a very esteemed female professor whom I once heard say during a disciplinary board meeting over a similar peeping case – “It is a horrible experience which makes female students feel utterly unsafe on campus and the trauma is difficult to erase.”

So without a doubt, the act of being filmed in a shower is a very traumatising one and it is hoped that Ms M has received full support in helping her mitigate and hopefully overcome this mental trauma. Such criminal act has no place in a civilised society and no other NUS student, male or female, should be a victim of such acts.

That said, was Ms M justified in calling for NUS to mete out heavier punishment (which currently stands at a semester’s suspension and the perpetrator made to write an apology letter to Ms M) and basically expel the perpetrator? As someone who used to sit on the NUS Board of Discipline (“BOD”) as a NUSSU student rep (albeit back in 2013-2014 before the #metoo era), I think the matter is more nuanced.

1. Proper channel of recourse in criminal matter

If you look at what Ms M recounted, the matter was reported to the police, complete with CCTV evidence etc. Then, after investigations, the perpetrator was given a conditional 12-month warning period in lieu of prosecution. More damningly, Ms M said that the investigation officer told her to look for NUS if she wanted “heavier punishment”.

That’s when I think parties got things wrong.

In the criminal justice system, the Public Prosecutor (also concurrently the Attorney General) is the one, working with the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”), who decides whether to bring charges in a criminal matter, and if yes, what kind of charges to bring. It is not and should not be the province of NUS to bring criminal charges or mete out criminal punishment.

In this case, it is apparent that the good folks at the Attorney General’s Chambers (“AGC”) and SPF have decided not to press charges and instead issue a conditional warning period in lieu of prosecution. Legally speaking, that is and should be the end of the course of seeking criminal justice in this matter, simply because the person vested with prosecution powers (i.e. the Public Prosecutor) has made the decision not to press charges. The investigation officer should not have asked Ms M to ask NUS for “heavier punishment” because the criminal justice has run its course in this matter here. NUS does not have, and should not have, the powers to mete out criminal punishment or bring criminal charges.

2. Jurisdiction of NUS Board of Discipline

This was a question pondered by some of the BODs I sat on – what is the source of NUS’ disciplinary powers? My suggested answer, which didn’t get challenged, is that it arises from the contract signed between the student and NUS. The power to discipline has a contractual source but it may have a quasi-criminal nature due to the nature of disciplinary processes.

During the course of my time on NUS’ BODs, there are many cases where there is an act that has a criminal element. The standard NUS BOD practice, back in 2014, was to wait for the criminal proceedings to end before proceeding with the NUS disciplinary process. Although both proceedings arise from the same facts, they are of a different nature. The criminal proceeding arises from the public’s interest in ensuring that criminal conduct does not go unpunished. NUS’ disciplinary process arises from the university’s interest in ensuring that the rules and spirit of academia are kept in place and that students do not misbehave in the context of the university-student or student-student relationships/context.

To give an example, let’s say a student has been caught stealing outside. The criminal proceedings are for the act of stealing and how it harmed the public’s interest. The NUS disciplinary process is for how the act brought the university into disrepute. Fine but important difference – the NUS disciplinary process is and should never be a substitute for the criminal justice system. It is at best complementary but not a substitute.

3. Proportionality of sanctions

One controversial point raised by Ms M was that the sanctions meted out by the NUS BOD to the perpetrator (a semester’s suspension + write a private apology letter to Ms M the victim) is vastly disproportionate to the act itself. I make no comments on the proportionality of the sanction to the act, except that back in 2013-2014, the types of acts that attract expulsion from NUS usually involve academic dishonesty. Examples include repeated cheating, falsification of experiment results, fraudulent declarations during admission etc. It is not difficult to understand why – the university’s main interest is to maintain the integrity of the academia environment. Academic dishonesty strikes at the root of such integrity and therefore deserves the highest sanction – expulsion. Unfortunately, peeping and filming in showers/toilets did not fall within that category of acts that attract expulsion. Suspension and fine, yes, but not expulsion. At least not back in 2013-2014.

That being said, in the half-decade since, society has gotten more sensitised and enlightened over sexual assault, harassment and crime. I am sure the NUS administration will review the range of sanctions for different acts and update them to be in line with societal norms and expectations.

4. Pressure to keep things under wraps

I posted this earlier on Sheryl's post and I will repeat it here ad verbatim: “Can I just put it on record here that I once sat on a Board of Discipline regarding a peeping case in one of the Residential Colleges back in 2014. For context, the Board of Discipline is convened by the Registrar’s Office so it depends on the case being floated up or complaints made directly to the main university administration. What shocked the particular Board I was on was that the student being charged for peeping in showers was not a first time offender. Apparently the RC senior admin wanted to just give him an RC level disciplinary measure and keep it under wraps at the RC level. When the incident occurred the second time, they couldn’t contain it anymore.”

I think there is a bit of implicit pressure not to let things blow up at different levels of the NUS administration, from the university level (e.g. Registrar’s office) to the faculty or residential college/hall level. Perhaps something that should be considered is that clear and expeditious reporting of such acts should be mandatory and incentivised so that university administrators at all levels will feel no pressure to keep such acts under wraps. It will only be good for the university community at large.

5. Concluding thoughts

This is a horrible act by the perpetrator against a victim who was helpless (she was showering). He should not have done it even if it was allegedly under alcoholic influence (if you are drunk, go pass out on your own bed for the night). I feel for Ms M. After all, my wife, my sister and many other female friends stayed on campus and I shudder to think the trauma they would have felt in a similar situation.

Yet, I do not think NUS BOD is the best channel to address the seemingly disproportionately minor sanctions. The right course of redress is the criminal justice system. I am sure the good folks at AGC and SPF have their reasons, and I will leave it at that. Ms M may be better served by appealing through the usual political redress channels to have AGC and SPF revisit the case. Forcing NUS to serve criminal sanctions is a bad precedent that we should be hesitant to allow."
268,62102,"It's shocking how quickly commenters here turned against Monica Baey, accusing her of playing up the incident to seek attention. It's a reflection of how Singapore society treats sexual harassment in general - dismissive, and eager to point fingers at the victim. No wonder other victims of similar crimes are so afraid to speak up, they will be torn apart by unsympathetic netizens.

To date, the accused has not even issued a public apology of any sort. It is the least he can do in the face of such a huge uproar that is a direct result of his misdeeds. 

NUS needs harsher punishments to deal with individuals that engage in such morally apprehensive behaviour. The current punishment of a warning and one semester suspension amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist. At the very least, the perpetrator needs to be expelled. The school does not have the obligation to rehabilitate criminals, but it is obliged to protect its students. 

There is nothing wrong with the accused's reputation being ruined as a result of this incident. After all, he is at fault, and he has to bear the consequences of his mistakes. If he is truly repentant, he should acknowledge the harm he has inflicted on his victims and withdraw from school."
269,62096,"Hi, with regards to recent case. I, too would like to seek some advice. I'm staying at raffles hall and once, I had a female friend over in my room as we were discussing a project. When we were done, I told her I wanted to shower and she ask me to go ahead and she will see herself out.

After my shower, I thought she would already have left by then, so I only wrapped a towel around my waist and walked back to my room. I went back I was shocked to see her still there. I immediately tried to cover up but she smiled, grabbed my crotch and pulled the towel off. She giggled and spank my ass, then she just winked at me and left.

I was so scared, I wanted to cry. Kind of afraid to tell my hall masters considering I am a guy. That night I went to sleep full of fear and emotion, it was such a traumatizing experience...

Every day since then I would wake up and sit in my corner of my room and cry.

I really dont dare to face her anymore and i feel she should be asked to leave the hall.

Any advice?"
270,62082,"This message is intended for Monica Baey: 

I want to personally thank you for being so courageous and stepping up to shed light on the situation and how it was handled by the police and NUS. I have read a few comments that are trying to vilify the VICTIM for going public with this case. And it’s comments like these that make it so hard for so many women to come forward following sexual harassment/assaults. Somehow after everything you have already been through people try to justify the perpetrators actions and that is complete BS. They try to take your voice and place blame on you for sharing, and that is absolutely WRONG! 

Luckily most of these demented victim shaming comments are met with many other moral responses condemning the perpetrator and those defending him. 

This must be such a difficult time for you to have to relive the event and experience unwarranted backlash for your willingness to speak up for yourself and challenge a broken system that fails to bring you APPROPRIATE justice as well as REAL action to change the way things are handled in the future cases.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Thank you for your voice, thank you for your courage, and thank you for not giving up and accepting such a lackluster response from the police and the school.

I stand with you Monica. Thank you!!

I myself have diabetes due to family history, 5 years ago i was nearly blind due to my condition and i didn't gave up and change my lifestyle such as going gym, research and eating healthy, then i able to fight through and from 80kg to 63kg currently, no more medication required as i control my sugar intake very strictly and i even went to take up a personal trainer certificate and help others ppl facing problem like me last time. 

I have lots of scar on me and not really good looking, i have tried many ways to know new girls such as tinder or etc... for the past 3 years i have tried quite hard in searching my partners but never got one, i gave up last year on using such app as i got hurt really bad from many ppl in the app, i have tried 2 ways, one is telling the truth in my profile of my illness and 2nd is not telling them, my friend advice me not to tell first and try to know girls first and then slowly tell them the truth. but in my heart i felt bad for not telling but yet i tried my friend advice, so.... after some of the girls that i manage to stay in touch in the app and continue chatting, i told them about my illness and family background, they straight away not talking to me anymore. But some yes, they did replied me and they sort of tell me they are just looking for friends to tell in a way to reject me, some even told me (Why would i choose a unhealthy one where i can find a healthy and good looking one) this is where i got hurt that bad and gave up. 

Recently i had a trip with my company colleagues, there's a girl actually i interested in but i know she got attached recently and therefore i tried not to go near her although i felt a connection, i told myself again the reality i am facing, why would she want to be with me even she is not attached. I am not tall, handsome nor well live off, with illness and probably can't have child due to my illness that had made me very low sperm count and also i don't want to pass down my illness to my spouse although i wish to have a family. I am really sad but i can't achieve anything as simple as a relationship. 

In my life i only had 1 relationship where i did not turn out well, i really do love my partners if i still able to find some one i like and of course she like me too (even she does not), i will always try my best for her.

Thanks NUSWhispers for having such page for sharing people story, if not i can't find a place to share. 

Appreciate if real people can talk to me regarding such situation i facing in my life."
273,62063,"Er yeah would just like to give my opinion on the whole Baey issue. I think the real issue is that the punishment meted out and the expectation for punishment is different, leading to some kind of injustice felt by Monica and consequently the general public. While we should assume that the related institutions have worked SUFFICIENTLY (in their own understanding) to analyze this issue, that is not to say that these institutions have done ENOUGH (in the eyes of the public) to pursue this matter. That being said, as the laymen (i.e. general public) have no understanding of the logic behind the punishment that was meted out nor the actual ""who's in charge of this situation"", perhaps it would be better for the institutions themselves to come out and make things clearer for everyone. While this may not be sufficient, it would be a good first step towards resolving the issue.

Also, I wouldn't condone witch-hunting, but the fact that this sort of vigilantism and retributive justice is rampant just reflects the larger social issue: that many (or maybe a small but vocal group? But judging by the support this is gaining I'd go with larger group) of the public have lost confidence in the system to be taking matters into their own hands. Maybe the institutions should be working towards restoring this ""loss of trust"" instead of merely telling everyone that ""WiTcH HuNtS aRe BaD"" because everyone knows that anyway, they do it because they empathize with the injustice felt.

tl;dr Bigger issues at hand that needs to be resolved before these issues can be put to rest."
274,62060,"With regards to the recent saga. How about we take a step back and look at what has the NUS committee done for past similar cases. Maybe nothing has been done. Maybe things has been implemented, but not enough. Maybe the punishment has always been just suspension from studies for a period of time, that's why people felt that its worth the risk to carry out this atrocious act while being a full-time undergraduate? 
Stop blaming Monica, she must have been very desperate to do this on a social media as mentioned that the authorities have all turned a blind eye on her. It takes a lot of courage expose oneself to the public. Also, let's hope that Nicholas is really repenting on his actions while being suspended, maybe doing some volunteering work or charity, and not doing internship at some reputable company to build up his portfolio as I seen on the internet.

275,62059,"I am the OP of #61988 and I am responding to Sage Stark's post which follows: ""Please forgive someone if he peep at your daughter next time and all the school did was 12 months warning and a letter of apology given to your daughter. Please forgive me for typing this as well. =)""

I should not be the person to forgive the perpetrator. If my daughter is of similar age as the victim in question, then it will be up to my daughter, whom I expect to possess sufficient maturity by that age, to decide on her own. 

I would hope that my daughter can have the magnanimity to forgive and have the strength to cast aside all the negative emotions generated from the incident and move on to achieve greater things in her life instead of having any one particular negative incident define any part of her life.

However, I will not push her to accept or reject the apology as it must be her choice alone (assuming she is already mature enough). I can only counsel or guide as her father.

276,62048,"Hi #61943, 

I've been in an LDR for ~3 years myself, and I can relate to the worries in your post. 

For me, the most important thing was to communicate. Try to be honest with each other, and be upfront about your individual expectations. For example, you said ""I feel that if a person really matters to me, I will still find time everyday to talk to her..."" Does she know you think this? It also sounds like you weren't officially in a relationship before she left. Would you be hurt if she decided to date someone while overseas, and vice versa? Try talking it out with her, and see if her expectations of the relationship match with yours. 

If you both decide to go ahead with the LDR, here are some tips: 
- Arrange visits if you can. It really helps to know when you'll see each other again; even better if you know the final deadline of the LDR when you'll be together. It's nice to take turns to visit, but if not then discuss it openly, don't let flights/money become a sore point. 
- About flights: Google Flights is great, in particular for tracking flight prices. It's best to buy from the airline directly; avoid fishy-looking third parties. If you plan to fly frequently, look for card rebates, discounts, points etc. 
- If money is a problem but you're determined, this is a chance to get resourceful. Part-time jobs can help (NUS has some). 
- Make sure to continue living your life while apart. You'll have more interesting things to share when you message or meet up. If you can, do something fun/creative with the messages and calls, or try snail mail :)  

If something doesn't work out, it's okay to agree to separate, and try again if in future you're both single and in the same place. Good luck!

277,62041,"One of the posts stating that the perpetrator was doing his ""internship attachment"" is false. Chemical Engineers need to do an industrial attachment to fulfil their modular credits for graduation but this is a module itself from NUS and was not taken by the perpetrator. He did his own out sourced internship that had nothing to do with NUS. Don't take everything the victim says at face value. What does she want him to do, stone and sit in the room or learn his lesson and make the best of the situation?  "
278,62039,"People have defended both the victim and perp in the recent saga. But I'm just thankful that Monica spoke up and NUS is actually taking a step (although we dk what's gonna come out of it yet) by setting up a committee. Just look at the past cases in the link and you'll realise that the punishment meted out is actually quite similar to past cases. But because no one has kicked up such a big saga that NUS felt the need to do something about it, every past case has been swept under the rug. At least we're one step in the right direction (hopefully).

The 3 girls that I have dated after my first all seem to drop interest in me when I start asking them serious relationship question like ""where do you see us moving on from here?"". The first few dates would always turn out to be good and eventually it would lead to sex, but whenever I try to move beyond sex the girl will start to drop interest and eventually siam me.

282,62029,"To be honest I think OnHand Agrarian is just doing it out of anger for the perpetrator. I mean yes, change is necessary, the punishment was too light, but is expelling the student and making him lose his job really the best way to punish a pervert? How about more psychiatric help? Do you know what kind of man is the scariest? Someone that has nothing to lose. So if you strip everything away from him. Obviously, his reputation is gone, then you take away his education (left with A level cert), his job. What kind of man will he be, left in the society with nothing? And btw, he is a student on financial aid, you're essentially forcing him into desperation.

I support Monica because of what she is fighting for - more measures and support (mandatory moral education, lol, better bathing protective facilities) in residences to prevent further incidences, mental and physical support for victims of this heinous crime, even a harsher sentence for Nicholas, but expulsion is just too much, especially if NUS does it out of the pressures from another company? 

Please people, when you support the campaign, I hope you are supporting the cause for more change and a safer environment for our students and not supporting it out of hate for Nicholas, and choosing to disgrace him. "
283,62022,"I would just like to raise some points on Monica’s incident.

I am not in any ways affiliated to Nicholas, and neither am I supporting his actions. However, looking at some of the debates circulating on social media sites, I would like to opinionate from a fairer perspective. What has happened to Monica was indeed unfortunate, and I’m sure many of us, including myself, are sorry for her being a victim to a sexual predator. What Nicholas did was simply not tolerable in our society. However, Monica’s actions are not something we should proud of either and we should not be activists of an issue that we are not clear about.

NUS is not a disciplinary body. Yes, the institution has statutes governing disciplinary actions related to sexual assaults (Statute 6, Clause 3, Circumstance I). I believe NUS actions were appropriate. The institution referred the case to the Police, and it was the Investigation Officer who recommended to Monica to approach NUS should she have any qualms with the disciplinary verdict. The 12-month conditional sentencing was met out by the Police, not NUS. NUS gave Nicholas a semester ban and as an institution, it was a clear sign that NUS wanted to give perpetrators a second chance, regardless whether one is an existing student or a potential criminal. Monica’s actions seemed to be pushing NUS to a corner to have the perpetrator expelled, by condemning NUS and Nicholas publicly on social media. Is this really the right thing to do?

Many of us are narrow-minded. One day we will be a parent ourselves. If one of our children does something wrong, and the victim condemns him or her publicly, and wants him or her expelled or dismissed from an organization, taking off his or her entire livelihood, would you support the public’s move or stand up for your own child? Similarly, if our own children are victims, I believe we must be more open-minded because everybody deserves a second chance. Punish appropriately and support rightfully. I was once preyed on by a sexual predator, but I did not condemn the perpetrator in public and I moved on from my own experience. I believe there are many victims out there who has dealt with their own experiences, so there is no reason as to why Monica must handle her issue in such a manner by putting NUS and the perpetrator in such a difficult position.

Monica’s attitude does not sit well with me, I’ll be honest. Yes, her public shaming methods was to garner support, but lately her posts have put across a message that she was enjoying the public attention from the entire incident. Her behavior in the posts does not justify her emotional distress.

Also, many are raising talking points on women rights and protecting women. I would like to make it clear that not only women are prey to sexual predators but men as well. Before many of you go on a social media rant about how women should be better protected, think again. Everyone should be protected, regardless of gender.

Once again, what Nicholas does is intolerable and should be severely punished. But what Monica did was also not something that people should be proud of. There is no wrong being sympathetic, but are you sure what she is doing is morally correct? 

Raise your support in the right way. "
284,62021,"I only have 3 points to make about all this:
1. Why are things in Singapore in such a way that if a serious crime occurs within a NUS compound it more often than not goes through the Board of Discipline instead of directly investigated by the police (which should have been the case for the more serious incidents during several O'Camps in 2016)?
2. To those who allege and assert that she is just seeking attention, think about this: If she did not speak up as with all other previous victims, this would go on and on and nobody would ever know the truth of what really happens. In fact those people making allegations are the ones seeking attention for themselves by discrediting her and supporters in any means possible.
3. It was never about targeting a certain individual, it was about bringing real changes to NUS. I am worried that some students are becoming extremely myopic about this."
285,62019,"Amidst the uproar about the voyeurism saga, perhaps it would be nice for us as a community to exhibit some empathy. 

Yes, we all have our own skepticism and personal nuances towards the perpetrator or the victim. However, I wish to invite everyone to think deeply about how each of the parties involved would feel from their points of view before attempting to make a post. What the parties involved decide on going public is solely their own discretion and could very well be things which are sensitive to them. Do not forget, beneath this cloak of anonymity (NUSWhispers) is the very vulnerability which each and every one of us are afraid to show everyone (i.e. our privacy). As a rule of thumb, if you would say the same thing to the whole community in real life as you are about to do so on NUSWhispers, you're good.

From the victim's POV, comments like ""milking it for the fame and enjoying it"", ""she should be a decent human being and stop the witch hunting and mob lynching now with all the news she’s getting"" and ""she did not need to target Nicholas specifically"" are all things which may further injure the victim and pretty much uncalled for. Think about it, if you were the girl being filmed, regardless of whether you want attention, you would certainly be feeling stressed out, helpless and weakness from all the trauma and pressure you've been through. In an assured position of weakness, do these comments help alleviate or at least empathise with the pain you have been through? 

From the position of the need for attention, what does a few thousand more followers have over the fact that you have given away your position of vulnerability? From this aspect, I respect the victim's courage in speaking up for herself for something so personal and sensitive to her.

From the perpetrator's POV, comments like ""he deserves everything that has happened"" is really not for us to say. You may disagree with his actions, but are you sure you are objective enough to see all the relevant facts and make a verdict on his punishment? If not, as many have said, your comments could drive him to his ends. Perhaps you think as a victim, he deserves no sympathy. I then invite you to think again, are you objective enough to decide who deserves sympathy? If not, do not add to the fire. You may think your comments are a mere reflection of everyone's opinion and therefore fits in, or on the other end of the spectrum, insignificant enough to cause much damage. Allow me to impress upon you, however, that words are powerful and they slice in the slightest ways you fail to imagine.

One more thing to note, most of us agree that there has to be some form of improvement to the system or precautionary measures being put in place. If you really think you have a good idea to improve the system, do highlight through the proper channels. You might think that they do not listen, but they certainly would not if you post here. 

TL;DR: Please post with empathy and responsibly. Keep your comments to yourself if you have to. If you have a good suggestion to improve the system, highlight through the proper channels."

288,62014,"This entire Baey saga... It's as if media have nothing better to talk about. Surely enough that the perps need to be dealt harshly, but resorting to vigilante acts to call out on NUS and perps is getting out of hand.

Despite that, perhaps she might have done the right thing. From this, we can come to one common conclusion: this lady has exposed how NUS treat  important matter concerning students and its welfare with such leniency. How to place trust in NUS' governing body when they could not provide us students with the security that we need to live our student life with peace of mind, be it in and out of hall?

My assumption is that NUS knows no matter what, as students we wouldn't even think of dropping out of NUS even when our rights are violated because we see value in the precious paper they brand us with. A simple hush-hush was enough to sweep the matter under the rug, thinking student's life will just go on as we grind and mug, drowning in paper chase. 

It's just sad when university sees student as cash cow to propel their so-called ""world class research centre""."
289,62013,"Disclaimer: I'm not condoning the Accused's actions and behaviour. But I believe that the outcome is at the minimum procedurally fair (I leave open the question as to whether it is morally fair).
This post seeks to state that the process was complied with. Perhaps moving forward, the university has the discretion to mandate harsher punishment. (Note that I say moving forward and not for the current case).

Some of you are saying that the police/prosecution was lenient etc etc etc.
But what if I told you that as this is the Accused's first offence, the prosecution/police has the discretion to let the Accused go with a warning?
Now some of you might argue that this is 'unfair'. My counter to this is that the prosecution/police has good reasons to issue the Accused a warning. The prosecution/police not only have the information and evidence, but are also responsible for crime control etc. They came to this decision having taken into account all relevant  considerations.
Now some of you might also argue that prosecutorial discretion is subjected to review as all powers have legal limits. Ramalingam (SGCA 2011) states that prosecutorial discretion is subjected to review where (1) there is an allegation of bad faith; (2) exercise of the discretion contravenes a constitutionally guaranteed right. 
But in my opinion, it is hard to prove that there is bad faith in the current case and I do not see any contravention of a constitutional right.
Now, some of you might argue that that nonetheless the punishment was too lax. But this is not something the police/prosecution can control. Only parliament has the power to change the punishment etc...

Moving on to the jurisdiction of NUS. In my opinion, the courts system is responsible for penal cases and decision and not NUS. I think that the jurisdiction of NUS should and must be separate and that the Board of Discipline should serve the specific purpose of ensuring student discipline. I also think that a student should not be punished twice for the same offence and that in this case, punishment was meted out.
Nonetheless, some of you might argue that the punishment meted out in this case was too lenient. NUS can update its regulation, but case is closed on the current case.
I would also venture to suggest that NUS is rightly concerned about its reputation in the current case. Punishment was meted out to the Accused and thus, the case is closed. Moreover, I would like to suggest that the Victim herself breached confidentiality by coming out in the first place. I may or may not come back to this later.

Now I would like to move on to the decision. I'm only concerned that the procedure was followed and in this case, the procedure was clearly followed. Which means that if anyone wants to complain, they have to allege some form of procedural unfairness. This is a high threshold to meet and I don't think it will work.
Moreover, I doubt that the victim herself can appeal as she does not have locus standi (In the courts, or in the Disciplinary Board)

Concluding thoughts: Res Judicata. 
Also, the whole situation is completed according to the process. Justice was done in the present case (whether you like it or not). I do understand the outroar over this, but please, NUS can only change the rules for future cases and not for the current case. NUS is also doing so by convening a committee to review the rules.
The petition has served its purpose - awareness was raised, and NUS is trying to solve the problem.
(Although I saw a post somewhere which states that NUS' punishment framework is consistent with the other universities both locally and worldwide)

Back to preparing for Finals."
290,62012,"There are some things here which have surprised me over these days, and I would like or raise several issues and thoughts. The whole issue has indeed shown me the state we as a society are in today.

Let me start off by saying that this post (or I believe any post) does not condone the actions of the perpetrator. What he did was explicitly wrong in any sane mind, or in any universe. 

One thing I do not understand however, is the need to blame NUS for the whole issue. The NUS disciplinary board and the AGC are 2 completely separate bodies. The former is an educational institution while the later holds the right to charge offending parties. Traditionally, when acts of criminal nature are committed, the AGC has the final right to decide what the appropriate punishment should be. This is where the search for criminal justice ends, as the prosecutor has decided whether they wish to pursue the matter further and bring it to court. If you are unhappy with the decision, go to the AGC and the police to revisit the case. The ""victim"" claims that the investigating officer (IO) told her to seek ""harsher punishment"" from the school. If this is true, the IO also made a mistake here as NUS simply does not have the authority to exert criminal justice.

NUS is an educational institution. Its rule and punishments primarily revolve around academia and protecting its academic integrity. We are no longer in primary school, where talking back to a teacher warrants public caning. Decide to plagiarise other's research or falsify your data? Then yes, NUS might expel you. Why is it like this? Its because the AGC and NUS disciplinary board serve 2 different functions. The NUS disciplinary body is not and should not be a replacement for the criminal justice system.

And please guys, we're all in university.  I thought that it was finally a place where we could have nice discussions on how to improve the system, listen to nicely phrased arguments without emotion taking a centrestage all our arguments. However, what we're seeing here are comments we can also see in the Straits Times comment sections. Rational arguments are now considered to be the politically incorrect thing to do, and hence do not appear much. This is because any viewpoint (just like in the ST comments) with a slight deviation from the norm would be met with responses like ""if its your mother or sister..."". This slightly intrigues me as it seems to blame the opinion for being wrong per se, instead of trying to have a reasonable discussion like young adults. There is a clear difference in the way some of you phrase your arguments, and well the quality of discussion in other faculties.

Last thing, y'all are a painful reminder of why online vigilantism should never be condoned. 
Don't like the punishment? Please go to the relevant authorities. To those of you harassing the guy involved, don't give us the shit that ""if he didn't want to be harassed, don't do it in the first place"". You have dragged innocent parties into the mix as collaterals, and that is simply unfair to them. To paint a mental analogy in your mind, you're like a big-sized Batman speaking Singlish.

Im sure I'll get a lot of flack for holding a view which is not the same as yours. I phrased this with the mindset that I would be talking to a bunch of Straits Times commenters, but I do hope you all will forgive me if a small detail of my argument does not agree with yours.

294,61998,"Looking at the recent peeping tom saga, I noticed this trend of mob mentality where majority of the netizens have made it their duty to condemn the authorities for allegedly failing to give an adequate punishment to the perpetrator when they do not have access to full facts and may actually be barking up the wrong tree. (Let me state for the record that I do not condone the actions of the perpetrator and I do have a young daughter for whom I pray will never have to be caught up in such a situation).

I am especially disturbed at the fact about how much this event resembles the ""honor killing"" in some Middle Eastern countries where the community rises up to be judge, jury and executioner and eventually stones the criminal to death i.e. we are witnessing the online version of ""stoning to death"".

Case in example: OnHand Agrarian is the latest to hop on the bandwagon and has released a FB statement this morning to cut off all ties with NUS until the perpetrator has been expelled.

Seriously, is it already not unethical for this company to use such a heavy-handed approach in an attempt to strongarm NUS? Or perhaps the company thinks it is best to hop on the mob mentality bandwagon, distance itself from the perpetrator and join in the ""stone throwing""? This is totally opposite of how a company should run its CSR program.

Back to case in point, the Police has obviously gone through due process (i.e. conducted a diligent investigation, gather all available facts, compare to past cases and past established precedents, consulted with AGC etc.) before arriving at the outcome of issuing the 12 months conditional warning to the perpetrator. 

NUS must have also considered all available facts (including the outcome of Police investigations) to arrive at the punitive actions decided for the perpetrator. And yes, I agree the University does have gaps to address in its penalty system for student misconduct and that the social media outrage has most probably forced its hand to review the system which is not necessarily a bad outcome. 

However, should we all now take a step back, give time for the University to perform its own internal review and also give space for the perpetrator to reflect on his own actions? Seems like everyone has forgotten the perpetrator is also a fallible human being with emotions and it seems to me that he has enough punishment (both in tangible and non-tangible sense from the online raging) to last him for quite some time.

Furthermore, the anonymous group of admins behind ""NUSSU - NUS Students United"" could not be verified to be undergraduates in NUS and should not have the right to leak such posts.

297,61990,"My two cents worth in response to the Monica Baey incident. I don't think NUS doesn't care about the safety of its students. I was personally involved in catching one guy filming in one of the toilet. Here's the story: 
I went to the toilet and a group of girls were muttering among themselves looking panicky. I asked what happened and one of them told me she was filmed by a peeping tom using his handphone in the toilet from the other cubicle and suspected the peeping tom was just sitting at the lobby area near the toilet as she could recognize the hp cover. I immediately took the victim to report to the campus security  while asking the other girls to keep watch not to let  guy leave. The security followed us back to the incident location immediately.  Upon seeing the security, the guy tried to run away and security gave chase. After confronting the guy and looking into his hp photo collection but couldn't find the actual footage, security called the police. This happened on a Saturday. The chief campus security investigator dropped what he was doing outside and came back immediately (he explained this as he was dressed in T-shirt, shorts and slippers as if looking rather unprofessional). The police came and took the guy away. When i asked what's going to happen to the guy, campus security said as this was a criminal case, they have to let the police handle it. Btw this happened in a rather public area of nus. 

For those who are still condemning Nus about the Monica case, I'm not sure if you are targeting the right board! Nus is not the police. What's been handled to the police stays with the police.  Nus is here to educate people. By condeming nus for allowing this peeping to be back studying,  does it mean also that education institution should not allow any ex-criminals to be enrolled? So much talking about giving ex-criminals a 2nd chance, how is that possible without first embracing the chance to education?"

I should not be the person to forgive the perpetrator. If my daughter is of similar age as the victim in question, then it will be up to my daughter, whom I expect to possess sufficient maturity by that age, to decide on her own.

300,61986,"Massive uncalled for TLDR post aka /when procrastination strikes/: Some thoughts on the recent controversy. 

Was the campaign demanding change manipulative? Yes it was. As are many successful campaigns. Purposed narratives were fed to you through your feeds, accompanied with powerful calls to action and immense social pressure to support the cause. The best narratives (factually accurate or not) are always presented in the way which helps the writer's cause most. So, in that sense, a lot of manipulation went down. Your emotions and sentiments were skilfully managed by content creators. 

And the numbers tell. It was a well-executed, effective campaign. 

But that's not necessarily a bad thing, and charges of manipulation on the part of the campaign starters merely distract from larger concerns now illuminated by the controversy. So do debates on their personal agenda and possible revengeful motives. To put this simply: if I started a charity seeking to glorify myself, this charity can still be of good to society. Personal and public interests are not always mutually exclusive.

Perhaps more helpful questions to step back and ask are: What is the extent of the problem -- based on reliable facts -- which this cause is concerned with? What good comes out of widespread support for this? What are the potential ramifications? These three factors need to be thought out, and weighed against one another. 

In writing this, my intention is not to favour any side. I hope that we, especially those of us in a position of less emotional attachment than the parties involved, can all go beyond the anger, anxiety, and consternation we feel. These emotions may motivate the burdens we have towards particular groups in the community, towards particular vulnerabilities, or our ability to empathise with various parties. Sure, and that's perfectly normal. 

But they should not reduce our views to mere labels (""victim-blamer"") and tag lines (""doxxing is wrong!"", ""we want change!"", ""blame the police not NUS""), much worse labels sitting on polarised extremes.This is a complex, multi-faceted issue. There are many things that need consideration, and many interests at stake. Sure, this situation is symptomatic of some systemic fault, and we want some kind of change; but to what extent, at what cost, and by what means? 

For voices to be heard, they need to ride on the momentum of mass support, and mass support works best with loud, catchy tag lines. I get that. But now that they've have been heard, I hope that we'll stop using our voices as passionate, well-intentioned instruments that drown out other frequencies, but instead carefully wield them as tools.  

TLDR: Let's have more productive, informed dialogues -- in which we present our views with all their warranted nuances. "
301,61984,May I remind all of you that all we have so far is Monica's one side of the story? Everything about her insinuating that there was sufficient evidence for heavier punishment is her side of the story. Do we really think the Police/AGC are so incompetent that they would not press charges if the evidence would sufficiently hold up in court? I fear for the future of guys in this country if any accusations without proof can destroy someone's life irrevocably. Next thing we know we start having people weaponising selfish agendas under the guise of sexual harassment like the Kavanaugh case.
302,61979,"Wanted to add that in light of the recent saga, I thought this is a good reminder of how our sexuality education is sorely lacking, and perhaps even failed us. 

As a female, I have always been a huge pervert ever since my first sexual awakening. I have been a masochist for years and fantasised myself as a masochist, and eventually enjoyed such endeavours in the bedroom. But in my pursuit of sexual happiness, there were several points where I had to figure things out on my own. Two main ones were how to accept myself as a sexual deviant; And how to differentiate fantasy from reality. 

The first was resolved when I realised that most people have some kind of fetish, somehow and deviant isn't that abnormal. Everyone is a little weird. 

The second, I got by through reading and learning from peers. And the second is the one i felt is relevant in the recent sagas. Instead of labelling peeping toms as fringe, abnormal, deviant or pervert, more could and should be done about improving awareness on how to differentiate fantasy from reality and also how to manage such fantasies. My two cents really. "
303,61978,"Those who are critical of Monica’s methods and intents really need to re-examine the situation. From her first post till now, NUS has really taken no additional concrete action other than well convening a committee, and even that is no guarantee of seeing any positive change. So if you think she was justified in blowing up the issue in the first place, you should be equally upset now to know with all the “change” happening. While convening a committee is a good step and NUS should be given some time to get their s**t together, it does not help that there has been no expressed intent to reconsider the severity of their sentence given to Nicholas, which is really the crux of this whole issue.

This leads to my second point about rehab. In the OSA email, “the rehabilitative needs of the student offender” was one of the factors considered in the punishments, so it is understandable that they gave a lighter punishment to Nicholas for rehab purposes. However, none of the punishments have addressed address “the need for justice for the victim”. Of the penalties stated in the NUSSU email: 

1. Does nothing to make the victim feel better. A semester’s suspension is about as much of a punishment as a gap semester holiday. If anything, Nicholas now has an internship to boast in his resume
2. Doesn’t even affect Nicholas since he doesn’t stay on campus. 3. Well I guess Monica will know NUS now has one less sexual predator if the counselling worked
4. Great that Nicholas is helping out the needy in the community but again, this does nothing to address justice for Monica. 
5. Just about as effective as 3
6. Monica has already expressed how woefully inadequate this letter is in doing justice to her, and i'm not sure if an email through the school really expresses sincerity
7. Probably the closest to any form of justice for Monica
In other words, none of the punishments meted out seem to even address the point of justice for the victim. They may serve other purposes, but this is perhaps why Monica still feels outrage despite these “hefty” punishments. Even though the “decisions and penalties imposed by the authorities” is another factor, NUS has also stressed that their disciplinary actions “are not a substitute for criminal proceedings”, so there is no reason as to why they need to reduce their punishments given just because SPF’s one is light too. And if we are upset with SPF for giving such a light sentence, we should be equally upset with NUS for what they are doing too. While I do agree that Nicholas’ punishments should still give him a chance a rehab, this is waaayyyy to light for a sexual assault. In the interest of protecting Monica from encountering the perpetrator in school, I think the least NUS could do is to impose a suspension for at least a year or more, so that she does not have to see his face at all, and at least the suspension would amount to something. 

In another point, some think that she has committed doxing by revealing his Instagram page. In my opinion, I think that for someone who was pushed into a corner after SPF and NUS could not help her any further, the least she could do to claim justice for herself was to shame Nicholas in public. Some might say that this is an emotional justification for what she was doing, so it holds no weight as a real justification. But in the broader sense of her strategy of garnering attention to pressure NUS to do something, revealing the identity of Nicholas does help to catch the attention of the public and boost the support she is garnering. 

So its really not so much of emotional sentiments that people seem to be blindly supporting her. People are not supporting Monica out of sympathy just because she’s playing the victim card, people are supporting her because Nicholas’ punishments are woefully inadequate, and more punitive measures are desperately needed. And to those who think that Monica is simply trying to destroy Nicholas’ life out of revenge, I hope you can see that there are real and solid reasons why she is continuing to express her disappointment and anger at the current situation, and there is more to be gained out of this debate than simply revenge. The push for more change has just begun, and there is still no indication that the injustice done to her will be corrected, so we don’t have any strong reason to believe she is overstepping the line and is just trying to sabotage the guy. To those who think we only have Monica’s side of the story, well the facts that were sent out in OSA’s and NUSSU’s email seem to corroborate the inadequacy of the punishments. To those who want to judge her for posting her excitement about being in the news, well this is an emotional point and should have no barring on matters of facts like those above. And even so, I am of the opinion that she is more satisfied by a small triumph that things have finally turned her way after seeing s**t play out like that for so long. And to those who think that Monica shouldn’t have gotten his friends involved, well this is quite true, I guess she should have censored their faces or something.  But let me also add that Nicholas' girlfriend made news for herself not just because her face was on his Instagram, but because of how willing she was to passively support his offences. To those who think that we may have traumatised Nicholas too much with this hullabaloo, that’s a highly unusual defence to make for a perpetrator. But even so, I think that being publicly shamed is part of the punishments in today’s world where its hard to escape the public eye and news spreads fast. Nicholas should have considered this before committing his crime. Even if he was drunk, it is perfectly reasonable to expect him to accept it as part of the consequences of his actions. Honestly if he’s reading this, my advice to him to just be to come out with a personal public apology and be willing to accept a stiffer punishment should NUS want to impose more on him. I think that will at least do something to address the point of justice for the victim and show some unforced form of remorse. Oh and to those who think Monica is manipulating us as a media student… come one man, you can do better than that. And nope I’m not Monica, I’m just another fellow engineering student who is disgusted by such acts.

PS: admins please let this post through as much as possible. If needed to maintain the confidentiality of the punishments (even though it was sent to all NUS students?), please redact as much as needed."
304,61976,"As another fellow female student from Monica Baey’s batch, I’m appalled to see the avalanche of accusations of her attention-seeking purpose. How not a single of these accusers even spare a note of empathy towards the victim, or mention her distress and trauma, but very readily spill venoms towards a person most of you probably don’t know in real life. What is even more disturbing, at least to me, is how these people are my school mates, maybe even someone I know, interact with. I guess that the way people react to unusual events can unveil a lot about their lesser-known side.

Guys, maybe if you’re not a woman, you will not understand the humiliation, the feelings of being violated, of helplessness, and shame for something you did not even do, and the fear that ensues weeks, months afterwards. It’s easier for the victim as well, to sweep it under the rug, forget about it, move on with life, rather than dealing with the emotional distress once we accept what has happened. Therefore, Monica, I admire your courage and strength to face the truth, and thank you for the goodness in your heart, that led you to share your story, regardless of all the negative consequences this can bring to you in the future (in your personal life, career and social relationships etc), in a hope of bringing about changes. Keep your head up girl, and thank you.

Lastly, I wonder, for the people who throw accusations around and people who support this view; if this incident has involved your girlfriends, your sisters, your female friends, your daughters; would you have done what you’re doing to a stranger? Or would you have wanted other people to treat your girlfriends/sisters/daughters/friends the way you’re treating Monica?"
305,61975,"Honestly before today’s email by NUSSU Exco, I thought Nic was only made to write an apology letter and be suspended for a semester. I got this impression from the original insta story from the victim and like many others, I thought that these punishments are not sufficient to teach him a lesson. Although I didn’t repost and stuff but mentally I supported the victim and believed whatever she said.

Now that the email informed me about the list of punishments that Nic will be subjected to, I am ashamed that I didnt take a deeper look into the matter before forming an opinion. I merely trusted the information that is presented to me as the whole truth.

Taking a step back, I think that the list of punishments is sufficient for a first time offender like Nic, and is in line with NUS’s aim to re-educate. Don’t get me wrong, I do not side with Nic by any means but I do think that he should be given a chance to correct his mistakes. And definitely by expelling him, ruining his life or shaming his family and friends are not helping to re-educate him.

So my point is that the incident has already gotten enough attention and we should leave the rest to NUS and SPF.

Cheers and all the best for finals :)"
306,61972,"First of all, we can all agree that what the perpetrator has done in the Monica Baey case is criminal and deserves punishment. The severity and kind of punishment is up for debate. 

There are a few matters that need to be recognized before anything else. 

1. The perpetrator has been named by the victim. 

This action is irreversible and in itself it is an extra-juridical action. Whether the victim has a right to this action is up for debate once again. However, people need to recognize that naming the perpetrator is a punishment meted out that is not sanctioned by the court. In this case, the perpetrator has gotten a third charge on top of the 12 month conditional warning given by the police and the actions taken by NUS. In spite of claims by the victim that there is no intention to exact further punishment, naming the perpetrator is itself a punishment regardless whether the victim reserves the right to do so or not. 

2. The media attention and follow-up actions taken by NUS & support groups 

The number of media outlets reporting on this case is huge compared to past cases of sexual offenses. Follow-up actions by NUS on this case was significantly greater compared to other cases. 

A review committee was formed, NUSSU was involved in discussion for heavier penalties and a petition was formed. If we were to turn to a case that is some years ago, (this case was from NTU, but similar to NUS, it happened in our public university), 66 male students were being filmed over the span of 5 months. 
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-arrested-for-allegedly-filming-other-students-in-the-7763030
No review committee was set up, much lower media attention was given to the case then.

Why did the other cases of sexual offenses deserve less attention and coverage than this most recent case? Does the crime commit against 66 weigh less than the crime committed against 1? 

We need to recognize that signing the petition and asking for harsher punishments means a departure from a rehabilitative model to a punitive model. If you were the victim’s parents, of course, you would want a harsher punishment on the perpetrator. However, if the perpetrator happens to be your kid, would you ask for harsher punishment? Do you think your kid deserves a second chance or do you think your kid should just burn in hell?

When you ask for a “different environment” for your daughter, sisters and gf, you are also asking for a harsher environment where mistakes are less tolerable and forgiveness a non-existent concept. That said, you have every right to sign the petition but do consider both sides of the coin. "
307,61968,"Thank you Monica. Thank you for bringing this to light. I myself was victim of sexual harassment on campus. I complained to my Resident Fellow. He confessed and was given a warning. I wish I didn’t complain because the hall residents said I must have “wanted it” and I “liked the attention”. If it happened again, I probably wouldn’t have said anything if not for this case. Justice can be served if we are brave enough to seek it. Thank you Monica. Your bravery means so much more than you know "
308,61967,"In case you did not know, the perpetrator of the recent saga is currently doing his internship attachment. So his suspension from NUS is not any loss to him because he’s ultimately boosting his resume out there with work experience. I still see many people saying the one semester suspension is a good enough punishment which I doubt so. If the victim never voiced out what happened, he will be happily moving on with his life with almost no implications for his wrong doings. Also those against the victim because she seems to be taking “revenge” rather than seeking for justice, let’s remember that it would’ve taken so much courage to voice out the truth and she did not do it knowing it’ll get so much attention. At this point this whole issue is blown out of proportion. The fact that authorities have said to step up and take more actions/review the current policies is a good outcome everyone should be happy about moving forward. So stop bashing either the victim or perpetrator at this point. Please move on. Maybe offer some thoughts and prayers to the victims and families suffering in Sri Lanka now?"
309,61964,"I have very little sympathy for Nicholas, and I think so do many of you who are seem to be alright with doxxing him. But even if you don't quite care about what happens to him, I would like you to consider the spillover harassment that his family members/friends might also have to endure, especially when they may not deserve the full brunt of the Internet's outrage. The truth is that there is very little argument that can be given in support of doxxing - internet mobs are irrational, are poor discriminators of target, and are not accountable to anybody - even if you think he is completely deserving of what he is getting, can you say the same for his loved ones? 

Punishing him should not have to fall on the internet - it should be the task of NUS Disciplinary Board and Singapore's Judiciary to ensure that proper and proportionate punishment is meted out. That's why if there's any entity or practice that should be brought to light - it should be the mishandling of this case by the appropriate authorities. It is possible to name and shame these organisations and practices without having to do the same with the individual. "

312,61946,"Machiavellian Lessons from the peeping tom saga:

""Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.""
~Niccolo Machievelli

1. Mob justice is sweet, effective, and efficient
It's 2019, everyone's getting woke. If you feel like you can't get the justice you want through due process, simply tap on the court of public opinion via social media. Much faster than going to the authorities which often require jumping through bureaucracy and which are much less focused on retribution than the public would be, since they will have to consider many other different factors in sentencing.

2. Always have a call to action involving the greater community
Nobody's interested in personal vendettas (this guy owes me money, make him famous, anyone?). Instead, frame it in such a way that your problem becomes everyone's problem. By making others feel like they have a personal stake in the issue, you greatly increase the chances of making it go viral. Finally, clearly state what you want people to do. In Monica's case, the desired goal is harsher punishment for Nicholas from NUS; with added framing, it becomes to review sentencing frameworks for sexual harassment, such that Nicholas and all future offenders get harsher punishments, on the basis that this will deter future cases of sexual harassment, and create a safer environment for female students living in hall.

(Note: Notice that what happened is a criminal offence and completely out of NUS' domain as an academic institution (the perpetrator could have been any random member of public, for whom NUS' punishments have zero deterrence). This is irrelevant - you need only paint a connection, and people will follow. Most will not scrutinize the logic of it)

3. Always ""hedge"" against moral risk
You risk getting discredited once you lose the moral high ground you are standing on, so always be mindful to stay on top. Revenge and name-and-shames are morally dubious, so always add a disclaimer to say that these are not your intentions (even if they are - especially if they are). What Monica did is a textbook example of making the name-and-shame appear like an unintended side effect of a greater cause. Unfortunately, she made a rookie mistake by stating in one of her earlier stories that she's sick of Nicholas being able to live life normally (and apparently post on Instagram). Don't do that, it reveals the intention for revenge. However, this is not a critical mistake, as it is understandable for victims to desire revenge.

4. Always go for the easy targets first
Notice that Monica didn't go after the police, even though the case was theirs to handle, and maintaining a safe environment for all is their responsibility? Instead she pointed her guns at NUS, even making it seem like the lenient police punishment (or lack thereof) of a 12-month conditional warning was their doing. The answer is simple - NUS is a much easier target, because they love their reputation more than they love their students, and especially because they have already been in the public spotlight recently for sexualized orientation games, leaving them vulnerable to scandals of this sort. Throw in accusations of a cover-up to create a perfect storm of public outrage.

5. Always claim intoxication when retrospectively caught committing a crime
Of course, if you're caught red-handed, this probably wouldn't work. But if it's the day or week after, alcohol intoxication can be a good excuse or mitigating factor for any reprehensible action. Essentially, you're trading in a major sin for a minor one. Even if it doesn't work, it's worth a try since it dosen't cost you anything to claim intoxication.

6. Contain the sources (apologize and make it up to the victim)
Machiavelli would have advised you to silence the victim as fast as possible back in the Renaissance era. That doesn't work so well now in 2019. Still, you have to contain the incident at their sources, lest you end up like Mr. Nicholas now. Always make it up to the victim in every way you can - buy gifts, apologize in person as sincerely as possible, grovel if you must. Build as much goodwill and rapport as you can with the victim, for this greatly decreases the risk of them forming a personal vendetta. Do this even if you are let off easy (by the authorities). Consider it buying insurance (coming from advisors' clique, Nicholas should understand this better than most)

(Note: When apologizing, always make it seem like YOU didn't intend to do it, that some kind of sickness compelled you to do it, and that you hate yourself for that. This makes the victim feel sorry for you and paints the narrative that you are also a victim (of your sickness) in this incident, which puts the two of you on the same side. See Andy Hui apology for example)"

315,61943,"Hi #61943, 

I've been in an LDR for ~3 years myself, and I can relate to the worries in your post. 

For me, the most important thing was to communicate. Try to be honest with each other, and be upfront about your individual expectations. For example, you said ""I feel that if a person really matters to me, I will still find time everyday to talk to her..."" Does she know you think this? It also sounds like you weren't officially in a relationship before she left. Would you be hurt if she decided to date someone while overseas, and vice versa? Try talking it out with her, and see if her expectations of the relationship match with yours. 

If you both decide to go ahead with the LDR, here are some tips: 
- Arrange visits if you can. It really helps to know when you'll see each other again; even better if you know the final deadline of the LDR when you'll be together. It's nice to take turns to visit, but if not then discuss it openly, don't let flights/money become a sore point. 
- About flights: Google Flights is great, in particular for tracking flight prices. It's best to buy from the airline directly; avoid fishy-looking third parties. If you plan to fly frequently, look for card rebates, discounts, points etc. 
- If money is a problem but you're determined, this is a chance to get resourceful. Part-time jobs can help (NUS has some). 
- Make sure to continue living your life while apart. You'll have more interesting things to share when you message or meet up. If you can, do something fun/creative with the messages and calls, or try snail mail :)  

If something doesn't work out, it's okay to agree to separate, and try again if in future you're both single and in the same place. Good luck!

Furthermore, my SO is a very kind man who likes kids but I am so fearful of the future (what if I can't give my kid ""enough""? will they have to choose between being kind but mediocre, vs being competitive but successful? will they have to work even harder than me to attain my current standard of living? can I support them while also saving for my retirement?) that I can't see myself as a mum while my other friends look ready to pop one within the next 2 years. My SO jokingly says that my brain is 'damaged' because I grew up poor and financially insecure.

332,61913,"OP of #61913 here.

I just want people to respect the police/legal system and not take matters into their own hands.

If u think there's a problem with the system, challenge with the system in the right way without harming others. 

Yes, she-who-will-not-be-named was traumatized by he-who-will-not-be-named. But that doesn't justify her destroying his life. When did we forget the saying, ""An eye for an eye make the whole world blind.""? How we are treat others is a reflection of ourself, how other people treat us should not affect that. 

To all those who accept her actions and told me to consider if she was my mother or girlfriend or sister or daughter. The answer I give u is the same I will not condone her actions of revealing the perpetrator and dealing her own form of punishment in the form of doxxing even if it's my relative or close friend who is the victim.

To those saying this is victim blaming, this is not victim blaming. Victim blaming is this: ""She should not have bathe in Hall, she is just asking for it, I mean it's well known that there are peeping Toms in NUS Halls."" 

How about you guys consider if he was your father or son or brother or boyfriend. Yes I will hate, despise him for his actions but I will be happy for him that he got lucky, that the system let him off easy, gave him a second chance.

P. S. Yes I know technically there could be one guy with one guy left. "
333,61909,"The recent saga in NUS sparked a change in policy making, and spearheaded many important and crucial changes in our school community. However, was what Monica did the right way to approach things? And what does she really want out of all this?

My discussion points are on voyeurism and doxxing, and what the appropriate amount of punishment is for the victim. Head over to the NUS website, and you can find their official statement and how they approached this. TLDR; NUS believes in rehabilitation, thus explaining their use of relatively light sentencing as compared to the ""real world"" where incarceration is mandatory. It's great that Monica did something to change the NUS policy and make the factor of deterrence even stronger, but could there be a better way to do so? 

Monica mentions the psychological trauma that she has went through, and by no means do i belittle that. However, reading her insta stories for the past few days, the line between beneficence and seeking revenge seems to be blurred. What she has essentially done is pit the whole nation against her perpetrator, and while I agree that he deserves a much more severe punishment, the way she has done seems to be out of spite. She is essentially out to destroy him, and his family, his friends, and whatever he stands for. He deserved the punishment and much more, but don't you think that we as a society are overlooking the trauma that this may have been causing him?

Sure, you may say that she has went through much worse, and well, an eye for an eye, he deserves the same, maybe even worse kind of treatment. I believe in punishment, but I do also believe in adequate punishment and rehabilitation. If you tell me that his life is over after this saga, I'm not surprised. Blasting his name out on instagram, the numerous reposts she has garnered, every news station reporting on this, we are essentially throwing someone out into the sea with his limbs tied, and hope that he will come back alive as a better person. 

Am i siding with the victim? Nope. In fact, I was guilty of reposting and doxxing the victim online, until i took a step back and realized that this isn't the way i wanted change to be enacted. Seeing her instagram posts ""mom, i made it on the news"", and overly mentioning the word ""justice""  just makes me doubt her cause. 

Like Monica, I do want to change to be enacted, and if this happened to me or my family members, I would wish hell upon the perpetrator. But, the difference is that I believe in rehabilitation and second chances, and as much as i hate him, I would refrain from getting his family and friends involved by posting all his details online. And if my story does get out to news companies, I would be relieved and thankful that my story was heard, and not feel overly excited that I made it to the news.

To everyone who has made it to the end, do think about what we want as a society. And to Monica, I do sincerely hope that you recover from this ordeal, because what happened to you was not ok by any means or standard. But now that you are in a position to enact change, hopefully you would do the best thing possible :)"

335,61905,"Just wondering abt the harassment case, so if the victim is a non-nus student and the perpetrator is also a non-nus student but the incident happened within NUS, what happens? Still rehabilitation? Or will there be police prosecution? Shouldn’t nus students receive the same human rights/privacy as a member of public? I’m speaking up as someone who got filmed by another guy a few years back in hall. I’ve graduated btw."
336,61904,"With regards to the harassing incident, I would like to come forth and mention that in my RC and house, a similar incident happened abt 1-2 years back. A guy was filming other guys showering and even in the suites toilets with a camera. I’m not sure if he filmed the mixed gender or the girls floor. He was caught and forced to leave the rc only. No other punishments were enforced. He didn’t even write an apology letter and the incident was not made known to the students. The punishments given for this kind of unacceptable behavior is too light. What happens if he repeat the offence again after he graduate? Or even commit more serious offenses?"
337,61900,"Reading all the submissions on here discussing the filming incident makes me want to laugh at how some people are bending over backwards to imply the victim is doing it for attention or revenge. How would you feel if this was your daughter? Your friend? Your significant other?

This incident was reported months ago, and NUS handled it badly, regardless of whether the punishment was adequate or not. Now that the matter has gained publicity they're urging future victims to come forward, but how should we trust the school to protect us or take our reports seriously? The letter of apology from the school reeks of insincerity. Empty words mean nothing."
338,61899,"The fact that there are STILL people supporting the culprit of the recent sexual harassment saga is appalling. He deserves everything that has happened, given how the school and spf haven’t rly punished him enough.

339,61898,"""For those not up to date. A circular was sent out:

DEAN OF STUDENTS’ CIRCULAR – SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
 
I want to begin with this unequivocal message – the University does not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form. We believe that every case of sexual misconduct must be investigated, and offenders must be disciplined. We are fully committed to strengthening and expanding the infrastructure, policies and procedures to investigate cases of sexual misconduct and to take strong disciplinary action.  
 
Our focus must always be to further educate students, faculty and staff about respect, consent, bystander intervention, and the support available to survivors of sexual misconduct.
 
We are sorry for the distressing experience cited recently by one of our students, which is of extreme concern to us. We have reached out to her to offer our support and assistance.
 
The offence committed was serious and has been investigated by the Police, who gave the male student a 12-month conditional warning.
 
When such offences are committed, the NUS Board of Discipline, which comprises student and faculty representatives, also conducts its own disciplinary proceedings.
 
It will consider factors such as the severity of the offence, the need for justice for the victim, the rehabilitative needs of the student offender, the safety of the NUS community, and also the decisions and penalties imposed by the authorities.
 
Our disciplinary sanctions, which are not a substitute for criminal proceedings, can include immediate suspension and expulsion, and/or an official reprimand, with the record of offences and sanctions documented in the student’s formal educational records.  The offences and penalties are made available online to all students to view at the end of each semester. You may view this on the NUS Student Portal.
 
We hear your concerns about having a safer and more supportive campus environment.
 
NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye will convene a committee to review the current student disciplinary and support frameworks. This committee, which will have representation from the NUS Board of Trustees, will study the approaches taken by other international institutions, and solicit views from you, your parents and other stakeholders. The review is intended to tighten the penalty system for offences that affect the safety of our campuses. We will share the findings of this study and follow up actions with you in the new academic year. 
 
There will be two student representatives on this committee – we invite interested students to send their names and contact details to osasec@nus.edu.sg by 28 Apr 19.
 
We urge you to immediately report all instances of sexual misconduct, which will be escalated to trained colleagues at the Office of Campus Security (OCS) for investigation. We have also put in place special investigation and disciplinary procedures to manage suspected cases of sexual misconduct to ensure confidentiality, timeliness and survivor care.
The 24-hour OCS hotline is +65 6874 1616. They can also be reached on email at ocssec@nus.edu.sg. 
 
We will do everything we can to ensure that you are safe and supported during your time with us.""

TLDR: Email osasec@nus.edu.sg to sign up and have the chance to give your input. I myself am graduating so I may not be able to meet their requirements but we need people to step up.

340,61895,"not sure if everyone else understands fully, but it would be great to get some clarification. if both the perp and victim are NUS students, how would a case usually go? 

1. Victim reports to NUS only: does the police get involved at all? from what's being said, seems like NUS encourages victims not to report to the police, and to leave it to the NUS disciplinary board.

2. Victim reports to police only: does the police inform/communicate with the school? 

3. Victim reports to both NUS and the police: do both organisations mete out separate punishments, and do they take each other's punishments into consideration? from the recent case, it appears that the police worked with the school to mete out the punishment, and the police almost defers to NUS. 

given the current NUS stance, it appears that it would be better for a victim to go to the police directly and bypass the school."
341,61892,"#61829 #53084 

Oh no, it sounds like I was approached by this guy too. I know it's him because he meows and he's a maths grad student. I just saw this on NUSWhispers by chance, and before this I didn't know that other people had similar experiences. I don't think I was harassed enough to make a case, but I hope sharing will help others stay safe and know that they're not alone. 

I first encountered him in April 2017 in Utown. I don't wanna reveal details that will let him know it's me, but I remember a few odd things about that first meeting: 

- He kept pestering me for my number or other contact, saying ""otherwise how would I meet you again?"" Over the next few weeks I got messages from him asking to meet up, but I just kept saying no.
- The conversation got a bit too close for comfort very quickly. He kept saying I'm chio, I'm special, I'm just like his fiancee etc. And ""I was just like you when I was your age""
- He knew I was attached, but still wanted to meet up for ""study dates"" and said I don't have to tell my boyfriend. I got super uncomfortable
- He asked if I was a virgin, twice
- He just seemed very preoccupied with getting an undergrad girlfriend. He was upfront about going around the university to look for girls, and asked me to refer him to single girls if I know any
- He talked about how he objectifies girls and ranks them by their attributes. When I brought up how it's uncomfortable for a girl to feel objectified, he said he saw no problem with it

In the end, after enough pestering I got pissed off and just told him firmly, no means no, I'm not responding to any more messages. It was freaky enough that I avoided Utown for about a year. 

Reading the confessions here, I guess I'm lucky I got away safely. Thanks to everyone who shared, you helped me realise it wasn't just me, and hopefully it helps other girls in NUS too. "

So what I really want to talk about is about humanity. You are right that he deserves a harsher punishment, you are right that he should be condemned by us all, but in a world where we are so caught up with being right, sometimes we might have forgotten to be kind. It will not pain me to see him getting his deserved punishment, and this is not about him or them but about us as a community. It really makes me very heartbroken to see us becoming so merciless. 

I know everyone feels the injustice and that’s good, but I feel that only when we are put into a difficult position like this, in a position of strength to determine someone’s fate, then it truly becomes a test of character.

As a result, I am very fearful about not having enough money and became quite career-oriented. I often go the extra mile at my job, but I'm under constant fear about under-performing over every little hiccup. 

I don't enjoy my life because everyday I'm thinking of what my bosses think of me today, what I can do to get the next increment or promotion.

349,61873,Hi I am writing with strong disappointment regards to the email this morning sent by NUSSU regards to the sexual harassment case. How can you publicly state the name of the victim? This behaviour is strongly unacceptable not only from a students view but as a Human Being! You have absolutely no sense of what is privacy! Moreover you mentioned that victims are encouraged to report to NUS. For what? For you to tell the whole world the victim has been harassed sexually?
350,61869,"I agree that more support can and should be given to the victim. But to everyone saying NUS should take a 'stronger stance', what stronger stance is it supposed to take? NUS should not be the arbiter or ANY criminal offense. Expulsion? Do you all think criminals should be stripped of their right to education? Society shouldn’t be allowed to go around taking away people’s education for their sins. That’s just ensuring that these people become a burden to society for the remainder of their lives. "

355,61860,"While I applaud her courage to press for change, I personally feel that she presented a very biased view of how NUS handled the case, and that she may be too irrational now. If you have been following the details closely, NUS has actually punished the boy more than sufficiently by suspending him for 1 sem, giving him an official letter of reprimand, making him go for counselling and rehab and do 30 hours of corrective work. The incident had also been reported to the police, but there was probably insufficient evidence to jail him. This shows that NUS has already done its part, so please stop blaming the school. I agree that more can be done to help victims, but I strongly urge all of you to read up what happened in detail instead of expressing your anger on the school irrationally based on what you see on your friends' instagram stories. "
356,61859,"in light of the recent incident about sexual harassment and statements put out by various parties, including NUSSU, i was very puzzled by point 6 as written by them. Reproduced here: 

""6.	NUSSU Exco also recognises, that as opposed to a criminal court, that rehabilitation is an extremely strong principle in how student offenders are treated in the Board of Discipline, given that NUS is an educational institution. NUSSU Exco also notes that the Board of Discipline had acted in accordance with existing precedent and due process, and respects that the decision by the Board was arrived at in good faith.""

This left me with a lot of confusion about how things are handled as per the school's regulations. As a result, I came up with this table to help myself understand potential combinations of titles and location of such an act. I'm not a law student and neither am I trained legally in any way, so I was hoping if anyone here could help me out and fill in the blanks?

I was quietly watching this page and this reply to mrbtech is actually the MOST SALTY reply to this whole shenanigan. I cannot take it, must reply back to all university students and to this individual.

Eh dude, firstly I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. You ought to blame yourself for being academically bad. Your failure becomes the world's fault now, for INFLUENCING YOU. 20 over years old and in a university and now you cannot decide what is right or wrong. Still want to be hired in a good company earning good pay?

Seriously who the hell cares about you scoring the best marks in JC and all your ridiculous competitions, volunteers and representation achievements when you scored a 2.88 despite all these. It only shows that you CHOOSE to participate in all the random activities but REFUSE to put in effort in your academics. Since when joining a company don't need to have good results? Besides lousy results, you want to showcase your awesome CCA achievements. Your awesome CCA achievements cannot even justify your technical ability lor. 

You think leadership comes without knowledge one ah? 2.88 want to be a manager earning 4.5k? Wait long long lor please, this is sinkapore. You want to earn 4.5k? Be a sales engineer and chiong lor. This field you need to chiong and hustle to earn the big bucks since you don't have the knowledge.

Sorry lor you don't have the white horse life where you can kiao ka and enjoy in the family business. Then all the worst you have to work hard right?

Eh please la the bunch of you really writing out of context to shame that OP. You want good pay good life then you study hard and be good in your studies first. If you score badly, you will definitely be filtered out. But once you enter the workplace it is a whole new ball game.

358,61855,"Noticed that netizens are upset with NUS’s handling of the recent Nicholas Lim/Monica Baey saga. But why ain’t people angry at how the police handled it too? Shouldn’t the police also be made to clarify their stance? I’m sure there are a few news report of people committing similar crimes and actually have been given an actual criminal record, with legit punishment). In this case, the police only gave him a conditional warning, which basically means nothing. And this is when there are evidences of him filming a naked lady showering?!

I have been a victim of upskirt photo/video before. I only had a few hours of sleep before the incident and hence I led my guard down; it didn’t come across to me that it doesn’t quite make sense for somebody to stand close behind me on an escalator during off-peak hours. I was maybe 15 seconds late in sensing something was wrong and when I looked behind me, the prepetrator have already been using his phone on me. FYI my dress length was below my knee so don’t victim-blame me. I confronted him while we were still on the escalator and proceeded to singlehandedly nab him after he denied my accusation yet refused to let me check his phone, which was in camera mode and he gave ran. There was CCTVs around that filmed the whole incident, multiple witnesses of the public and police when they saw me fighting against the man. Despite all of these, the police told me that I’ve already gotten the best deal possible since they’re deporting him (that man is a foreigner on visiting pass) because they only found photos/videos of my upskirt i.e. first offence. I felt that it wasn’t a heavy-enough punishment, as he could have at least been jailed for a few weeks before getting deported? Especially when there are concrete evidences and the actual victim was there to give fresh first-hand recount etc. Yet the police told me to let go of this. Till this day, I’m still very paranoid of taking escalators alone and even just being alone in public.

In this case, the victim had it worse than me (she wasn’t even clothed at all) yet the prepetrator’s punishment was non-existent, which doesn’t make sense at all. I really hope that the police would revise their punishment of Nicholas Lim... As for why I’m writing this here, I’m too chicken to bring this up to public whatsoever. Nobody except my immediate family and boyfriend knows about my upskirt incident and even at that time, my parents blamed me for wearing a dress (despite it being long). I feel ashame that I am a victim for something like that and I’ve been made to feel that it’s my fault by my parents and the police."

But I feel a very slight regret in having supported her. Identifying the guy, along with photos of his friends while asking news publishers to cover her story for revenge just wasn't right.

She has gotten her revenge now that the perpetrator will never be able to step out in society ever again. kinda having mixed feelzz about this.

The questions I tacked in A Levels set the foundations on how I should study, problems which come out of it and how I should solve it. Just like in uni, where a firm grasp of knowledge on my major would be a good indication that I can critically think in the field and perhaps contribute to the firm I join. 

More importantly, thank you to #61802 for your insight on the topic. I guess it does take a real life example to show people the reality of the situation, and I wish you all the best in your future career. Bottom line, grades do matter for most jobs as the first point of selection. What comes next (e.g. attitude and ability to work in a firm) will be judged AFTER grades were looked at. Typically, the people who say ""grades don't matter"" either really don't need them cos they are secure in their future, or are just trying to throw you off to study less for the bell curve.

A lot of you have commented (esp the guy who said something along the lines of it depends on what you do). I do acknowledge your point, and I did think about it. You are right by saying that everybody has different aspirations. After all, we cannot have a society full of doctors, just like how we cannot have one full of poets. But that brings me to the point I brought up in my original post. However, what mommy told me at the end of the day makes perfect sense; ""it doesn't matter how well you do, as long as you tried your best"". I admit that maybe me and the other guy might have made results sound like a means to an end. Thats not true, we are just saying that the notion of grades not being important is utter rubbish. At the end of the day however, there will always be people who do better than others. To the people who aren't doing well, as long as they have done their best, thats all that matters. To tell them however, that grades aren't important before they have even tried could lull them into a false sense of insecurity. Instead, EVEN IF WE KNOW that they are not at the top of their class, we should still encourage them to work hard, and the end product does not matter as long as they tried their best.

It might seem confusing but let me summarise my argument. 
(1) Grades do matter, I'm sorry but this reality will be here for a long time. 
(2) Grades are not means to an end. TRY YOUR BEST in whatever you do, thats what is important. If your aim is to be a world-class farmer, take a course related to it (hypothetically), and WORK HARD AT IT.

- Represent NUS in a good light? 
- Be a good fit for the university/programme you chose? (Is there anything that makes it particularly suitable for you?)
- Appreciate and make the most of your opportunity? (E.g. participate in school/activities, immerse in the culture, make meaningful connections)
- Cope well academically and socially, and graduate on time when back? 

I think you do stand a good chance if you can communicate some of these points in your application. Hope you get in, exchange is a fantastic opportunity :) Good luck! "

In my honest opinion, in this particular case yes the victim wants justice which is right and proper, but what she feels most sad from what I've been reading seems to be her disappointment and anger that this has happened on more than a few occasions, and in I'm understanding her correctly what she wants most is for the same thing never to happen to anyone else again. Rather than for everyone else to play judge, I think the victim reiterates very clearly that she wants there to be compulsory re-education or community service, which is something within the powers of the school. Again, prison sentences are not within the power of the school nor the police but the courts, and it would be crazy to bring corporal punishment into the university setting.

The suspension by itself unfortunately doesn't go any way to ensuring that there is going to be any change in the mindset and behaviour. It's like going to a 'some sort of therapy centre' (see Youtube and you'll see what I'm talking about), and saying ""It's OK, I'm dealing with this myself, no need for the police."" For some, yes a suspension is good enough for them to reflect on their actions, sincerely make up to the victim and never do it again. But for others who are more stubborn, this will not work. Something more helpful in changing all offenders and be of better use to the victims would be to institute community service & compulsory re-education during that suspension, and with someone (whether it's a counsellor or etc) to track the offender's progress for a full semester to see if the offender is ready to earn his second chance. Random phone spot checks for the offender (again this might be a privacy concern to some but I think at least for the period of his suspension it seems fair) or instituting a curfew for the period of the suspension if it's easier to strike at night.

On the other hand, I've been for rehabilitative measures where possible because I think what brings closure to the victim is that this shit doesn't happen again. You can jail the offender but if he ends up being that 25% of inmates who reoffend despite going through such a harsh punishment what you end up with is a hardened criminal, who may do even worse things in future. Our society still has some way to go in reintegrating former criminals after they complete their sentence, which is why we need to be cautious when we call for jail sentences because 1 in 4 will reoffend. Being tough on crime is one thing, but being tough on the causes of crime is another. You need both to nip the problem in the bud."

Oh no, it sounds like I was approached by this guy too. I know it's him because he meows and he's a maths grad student. I just saw this on NUSWhispers by chance, and before this I didn't know that other people had similar experiences. I don't think I was harassed enough to make a case, but I hope sharing will help others stay safe and know that they're not alone. 

I first encountered him in April 2017 in Utown. I don't wanna reveal details that will let him know it's me, but I remember a few odd things about that first meeting: 

- He kept pestering me for my number or other contact, saying ""otherwise how would I meet you again?"" Over the next few weeks I got messages from him asking to meet up, but I just kept saying no.
- The conversation got a bit too close for comfort very quickly. He kept saying I'm chio, I'm special, I'm just like his fiancee etc. And ""I was just like you when I was your age""
- He knew I was attached, but still wanted to meet up for ""study dates"" and said I don't have to tell my boyfriend. I got super uncomfortable
- He asked if I was a virgin, twice
- He just seemed very preoccupied with getting an undergrad girlfriend. He was upfront about going around the university to look for girls, and asked me to refer him to single girls if I know any
- He talked about how he objectifies girls and ranks them by their attributes. When I brought up how it's uncomfortable for a girl to feel objectified, he said he saw no problem with it

In the end, after enough pestering I got pissed off and just told him firmly, no means no, I'm not responding to any more messages. It was freaky enough that I avoided Utown for about a year. 

Reading the confessions here, I guess I'm lucky I got away safely. Thanks to everyone who shared, you helped me realise it wasn't just me, and hopefully it helps other girls in NUS too. "

Besides, I greatly doubt that NUS would consider any options she is proposing now, given that she did not first seek recourse from higher authorities in NUS, with people that have the power to make decisions, before seeking media coverage. After all, why would they consider her proposals? She knew very well what she was doing would tarnish the school's reputation.

Seriously who the hell cares about you scoring the best marks in JC and all your ridiculous competitions, volunteers and representation achievements when you scored a 2.88 despite all these. It only shows that you CHOOSE to participate in all the random activities but REFUSE to put in effort in your academics. Since when joining a company don't need to have good results? Besides lousy results, you want to showcase your awesome CCA achievements. Your awesome CCA achievements cannot even justify your technical ability lor. 

You think leadership comes without knowledge one ah? 2.88 want to be a manager earning 4.5k? Wait long long lor please, this is sinkapore. You want to earn 4.5k? Be a sales engineer and chiong lor. This field you need to chiong and hustle to earn the big bucks since you don't have the knowledge.

Sorry lor you don't have the white horse life where you can kiao ka and enjoy in the family business. Then all the worst you have to work hard right?

390,61786,"I would like to share a very meaningful lesson I've seen some time ago, and it resonates more and more with me over time.

You can check it out here, but let me share what I've derived from this below which slightly deviates from his.
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RBG1PadWI

My Life lessons:
1. Life is inherently meaningless. 

We are biologically coded to go through this cycle of birth, reproduction, death. There is nothing to lose or to gain at the end of the day. As sentient beings with the ability to think (be it logically and illogically), we are pushed into this miserable cycle with no purpose. For those approaching midlife crisis, you'll understand deeply our craving for MEANING. We try to find purpose from the people around us like spouse, children, family, friends, the less fortunate. But I see this as being analogous to two people freezing in an ice land with zero chance of escaping while they just rub each other trying to get some warmth. 

But fortunately we are also biologically coded to feel so damn good when we help others and get appreciated. Everybody's got their own level of thirst for this form of satisfaction, look around for your friends who seem too friendly, too outgoing, too helpful, their thirst is high. If you deprive such people of the appreciation they need, they'll just dive straight into depression, and discover the meaningless of everything.

2. Your happiness lies in other people's hands.

Just like the analogy mentioned previously, ""two people freezing in an ice land"", these 2 people may not find meaning in their death BUT if they spend their last minutes hugging each other out knowing that their warmth will make the other feel better, they will derive happiness and meaning during their time alive. You will find no meaning in rubbing yourself to produce some warmth. However, it is important to note, happiness is derived from the appreciation from others, not purely from your act of kindness. So, in this journey called life with a meaningless end point (death), if you seek meaning of your life, go be nice to people around you. And if you're lucky, some of the people in your life give you the appreciation you need. 

Side track, if you have an insurance friend, you'll see him posting on ig, fb or any other public platforms all the time thanking the people around him, appreciating the people around him. Appreciation is something that can be free coming from you, but priceless for those who receive it. It is an emotional drug that people need to fight the meaningless of life.

So, go out be active in showing appreciation to the people around you. Not everybody has got the fortune to have appreciative friends. Be appreciative to all, the cashiers, the cleaners, the lecturers, everybody. Depression can be found in tears and also the widest smile. You may be saving a life with a smile and thank you."
391,61785,"Recently some things happened which made me doubt whether true love exists. A couple of years ago, my uncle's business failed and he was made a bankrupt. He sold all his nice cars and property and his family's lifestyle underwent a huge downgrade. His wife left him soon after. One of my neighbours became permanently disabled in the legs after an accident and will need someone to take care of him for his life. His wife left him not long after too. I am hesitant about marriage after seeing these things. I think people only show their true colours in a crisis and all those things people say to their partners about staying by their side no matter what is just lip service. Right now, my relationship is rather smooth sailing and there is no way I can tell my girlfriend (or future wife) will stay until a big crisis happens. What should I do to protect myself in this case?"
392,61781,"Responding to: #61657. I think your argument and post is extremely problematic and counter-productive in improving the quality and support of local television. Yes, a large portion of the demographic captured by Mediacorp is comprised of members of the pioneer generation - but that's exactly and only because they're the captive market. Mediacorp has no competition for the viewer who has no access to cable television, or the knowledge or will to use the internet. Given the option of better programming, I have little doubt that older generations would also make the switch.

While you might be correct that there exist, at least in theory, a positive effect that might result from the covert PSAs littered in the storyline of local TV, you should also keep in mind (a) that it's exactly these PSAs that appear to turn off so many others from watching (if you care any at all about viewership from other demographics). (b) There is also equal opportunity for local tv to be used by corporate entities for covert advertising (read: unethical product placement). (c) It is doubtful that these efforts have any impact in encouraging cross-generational dialogue any way- the shows themselves certainly won't serve as a common topic if nobody under the age of 30 has ever watched them. And (d) there is a question about how accurate is their depiction of Singaporean worries and troubles if they only ever deal with these questions with the bureaucratically sanctioned sanitised kiddy gloves that appear to be issued with every show. 

The truth is that Mediacorp is losing viewers and will continue to lose viewers regardless of how people talk about it. Even the younger generations that you cite as once watching okto and kids central, now have smartphones and are internet-savvy enough to utilise YouTube. The solution to bring them back shouldn't be to remove their phones (though I think removing their phones is a good idea) and strapping them to a chair facing an okto original- it should be to improve programming to speak to the cultural and Singaporean-specific problems and worries that the youth have. If you want to support any product (local or not), your task shouldn't be to convince people to buy it regardless of its quality, it should be to support the improvement of the product so that it can stand on its own merits. And if the only people who watch it, are the people who have nothing else to watch, then it simply isn't very good.

Good art serves a purpose in society. It creates a shared national identity that transcends economic, racial, and generational differences; it serves as catharsis for the anxieties that are unique to the Singaporean experience. There's so much more that local television can be, and we do disservice to the industry if we say that we should support it regardless of what it's currently like. If you want to support the local tv industry, then demand more from the company, not the consumer."
393,61780,"Just an opinion, I strongly agree that the punishment was not severe enough and feel sad for the victim.  However, I do not support this social justice thing. Blowing the matter up on social media is akin to taking the law into one’s own hands.

While I have not experienced the trauma that she is going through right now, I truly sympathise with her. However, I urge everyone to think about the repercussions of their actions before hastily sharing her posts.

If the guy is clearly unrepentant, then yes, as a community of NUS students condemn him in unity. But without perfect information, I think we are doing him a great injustice and are likely sentencing him to a fate far worse than the law would ever have. Persecution from the whole country is far worse than going to jail. What if this guy was in fact truly repentant?
"
394,61779,"Lets see if this gets posted or not 

It seems many people have started talking about the voyeurism saga and NUS (and maybe even the police's) inadequate response. But I do find it interesting that while there may have been a few direct victims (the family, close friends etc), almost all my friends react just as strongly as if they were wronged. 

They tell me to think about ""what if you were the victim here"" but I clearly am not. Honestly, I would like to have discussions of these sort without people just going ""ITS WRONG NUS BAD CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE"" and if I shown any sign of resistance I'm blacklisted as a friend (like really? You know me for a few years now and you can threaten to unfriend me because of this? The last time this happened I was 8 years old)

I'm honestly curious about something (and obviously I cant be bothered to ask my friends when there seems to be a high risk that I'm misunderstood with REAL consequences) what do YOU guys think is appropriate punishment? 

Some seem to say a jail term is effective, both the experience and the permanent criminal charge. Some suggested expulsion as the minimum (also note that all Singapore Unis will know why you have been expelled). Fines seem to be warranted but I'm not a law student (neither are my friends) so the fine seems to just be ""whatever the law decides"" - even though it was the law that allowed a 12 months warning period. 

I'm legit curious what would have been an acceptable or applaudable action by the police, school, or both and any other party involved. It seems the few friends that do indulge me give all sort of responses that I'm more confused what should be done (although it seems like they are quite comfortable over-punishing versus under-punishing...which i am not)"

- Represent NUS in a good light? 
- Be a good fit for the university/programme you chose? (Is there anything that makes it particularly suitable for you?)
- Appreciate and make the most of your opportunity? (E.g. participate in school/activities, immerse in the culture, make meaningful connections)
- Cope well academically and socially, and graduate on time when back?

Hey there, I'm the original OP again. This will be my last reply and clarification for this whole debate.


Much of your retaliation comes from a student's perspective where grades matter and hard work deserves to be recognized. If you continue to think that way, that the world owes your for being hardworking and smart, that every company need to appreciate every interviewee's hard work during their school days, then I think you need some proper real life counselling. 

You are smart? Good for you. You are from the Ivy League? Good for you. Everyone will recognize that you are a smart kid who excelled in school. Grades are important to climbing the academic ladder, no doubt. Did I ever strung in the way where I downplay in excelling academically? No!

The root of my argument has and always as been the same. That being academically elite in your studies is not a representation of how capable you are in your future workplace. 

Firstly, I do not condone your statements : 

""like it or not grades ARE A REFLECTION of how intelligent you are (academically), the ability to retain knowledge and to a certain extent how hard you studied.""

and 

""As mentioned by many of you, ""no one cares about your results or where you came from, only how much you can bring to the table.""

Grades are only a reflection of how intelligent of how you are to a certain extend. You are going through an academic process where knowledge is pumped into your brain and you're expected to regurgitate everything you know into a 2 hour paper. 1 week after the paper you can't even remember some of the basics. I've been through that so don't bullshit me.

Boy/girl, I'm not running a charity over. I'm running a business where we have to constantly pit out talents, knowledge and ideas against our competitors, whether local or overseas. To excel academically is the basic criteria you need to even consider before entering any company. Who wants to hire a CAP 2.0 fellow? I'm sorry if I hurt your pudding emotion but this is a very realistic world. You want to apply for a degree holder position then you need to be a jolly good one. I would choose a CAP 5.0 fellow over a 1.5 fellow any day.

This addresses the need for academic results for applying a position in a company before the HR even starts reading into details about your resume.

Next comes the interview(s) where we would actually talk and understand how capable this prospective employee actually is. If we smell some bullshit, then obviously even if you are CAP 5.0, I would reserve my acceptance.

If you managed to smoked through your interview and land in my company then your probation period starts. 3 or 6 months, that is the standard. This is where you are really tested on how capable you are.

If you are good, then I'm glad I hired you as my employee and enabling you to grow professionally. If you are struggling but still have a very strong learning capability and character which I deem you can be groomed, you are hired. But if you cannot perform and through repeated meetings and counselling sessions on what is hindering you at work and you still can't improve, I don't give a hoot if you are a CAP 5.0 or not, out you go.

Smart student? Good for you. If you want a job here, then show me the results.

Secondly, I do not condone your statements again : 

""To say that grades are not important in the future, would just be a lie and give students in their impressionable pre-teen and even JC students the false impression that ""I don't need to work hard since it doesn't matter in the long term"".

Your argument is simply invalid and is a straw man fallacy. If you're taking it personally and refuse to take it as an adult who is soon entering the harsh workforce smiling at you, refer to my reply above.

Thirdly, I do not condone your statements, again and again : 

""While this may be true in hindsight, it is not right to discourage or mock those who have done well, telling them that no one cares about their results. After all, most of them worked hard for their grades, so shouldn't we celebrate their achievements with them?"" 

Your emotion is taking over you as you type as an unjust teenager.

I did not discourage or mock those who have done well. You shouldn't take things out of context into your own form of imagination. Any students who successfully passed or graduated, I'm happy for them. Anyone would be proud of anybody who graduated because it means we have successfully instilled knowledge into the young minds enabling them to create a better future. Sound cliche I know. 

On a personal level, I am genuinely glad about it and I celebrate these achievements.

But on a professional level, graduation is but a stage where you have proved yourself to be academically capable. Thousands of young adults goes through that stage every year. Hundreds of academically capable students apply for positions in my company every year. Am I supposed to connect to them on a personally level and share their pain and struggles? No! I expect your to show me the skills and knowledge you have to scale my business further. It is not a charity organisation here. 


Fourthly (Seriously?), I do not condone your statements, again and again and again: 

""Lastly, just cause a few of us are ""arrogant"" and think of people who did not do as well as inferior, does not mean that all of us fall into that same category. How would you like it if I said all the people in low-demand courses ""lazy"" or ""stupid"". You wouldn't like it, just like how the people in better courses don't want to be universally classified under the arrogant category. ""


Honestly I do not understand where did you get that from. I wrote from a neutral POV where both degrees are equally good in their aspect and what matters is whether they can offer their skills and knowledge from their textbooks into their work. Neither did I even attempted to generalize a perception that BEng students are universally arrogant.

Read: skills and knowledge from their textbooks into their work.

If you cannot offer despite coming from NUS and scoring a CAP 5.0, then you are not valued at all to the company.

So, what do you mean by ""just like how the people in better courses don't want to be universally classified under the arrogant category."". 

Did I see the word ""better""? You just slapped yourself in the face right there.


My series of post was to shed some light onto BTech and some motivation and wow, I managed to shed some light on how you should prepare yourself mentally for the working world today.


On an ending note, I hope you students stop harping on how you deserved to be recognized just because you did great academically.

Remember that meritocracy is the crux of our elitism issue today in Singapore. Meritocracy works to a certain extend and goes by stages (School, Work). Meritocracy in your company does not follow how well you did when you're in school years ago. You do not demand a promotion by reasoning that you score a CAP 5.0 despite showing a lousy performance record in your company.

Trust me, when you immerse yourself in the workforce years later you would understand where I'm coming from.

409,61754,"Definitely not a whisper but more to spread awareness. Those who have seen the story spreading on insta/media platforms, lets not allow this kind of things to be swept under the rug. 

A guy was made to write a mere apology letter to his victim (if you have seen it its extremely unapologetic and still makes it about himself). On top of that he was given a 12-month conditional warning (aka he will only be punished if he recommits the offense) for filming a girl showering. This happened in one of the halls near to FASS.

NUS even told the victim that the private punishment was severe enough already (who judges?). They also told the victim to keep quiet about this case. The police said they cannot do anything unless the case gets bigger. It feels like those public campaigns on privacy invasion are just lip service. The school is protecting itself and thus the perpetrator at the expense of the victim. 

The girl feels that the punishment is too lenient. About a year ago, an NTU guy was given 4 weeks jail time for secretly filming other guys in the shower.

In the guy’s defense, he was drunk while he was doing it, and he got a really good future ahead to be marred by such things.

Thoughts? Extremely frustrated to know that this kind of shit goes down and is being swept under the carpet. Not the first time this kinds of story have been heard. Last year around this time, a similar incident happened in one of the halls as well, the one near to business school. The school also swept it under the rug and tried not to create too much negative attention. 

It is extremely disconcerting to know that nothing is really being done and that the consequences of such behavior is met with a light tap on the wrist. "

Yes, Singapore has definitely a higher income per capita and it is a great country. However, I also want to encourage all Malaysians that we should not feel ashamed of our nationality.

419,61729,"I find our local culture to be frankly quite disgusting to the point where I question if there's any part of ""SG culture"" that people should be proud of. Let's just take a look at one of the major issues, this obsession with one-upping others. For context, I'm a local and over the years from looking at classmates, relatives, and other general complaints from people in the workplace I think I've become quite jaded. 

This culture of one-upism/die-die must compare is just blatantly disgusting. You can talk about how you only got 4 hours of sleep due to a long assignment, only for the other person to suddenly interject with how they only got 3. People seem to have the compulsion to make it a point to compare themselves against you, and in the way to reaffirm themselves. 

Even in NUS, you can't even say that you did well for a module or scored anything above A- without getting dirty looks from others. I'm not talking about people bragging in other's faces about their A-grades, but the kind where your friend casually asks you ""how did you do for XXXXX last semester?"", then immediately scowls openly when you tell them you get an A. Quite evidently they weren't asking out of interest or curiosity. It seems to me that achievement is actually frowned upon, unless it's your own! 

In the workplace you have the inexplicable discussion of ""how long I have not taken MC"" the moment someone goes on MC, where it becomes a flexfest of who has managed to suck up to middle management the best at the expense of everyone else due to presenteeism, which is another topic in its own right. Employees who stay behind later and later at night just because they want to be the last person to leave, which ends up being a staredown between the last two members, each waiting for the other to leave, just so they can claim they were the last person to leave, which somehow translates to them being ""hardworking and productive""...?"

But think twice before getting a thrashy and random tattoo. A wolf tattoo might make u look cool for a day, but it makes u unoriginal and thrashy your entire life. 'What if there is a meaning to my tattoos?', one might ask. The problem is many don't have a legit reason for getting a tattoo.

Beng itself is too complicated and academic. Btech while watered down is also not necessary for real life work.

The whole purpose of btech and Beng are just a piece of paper to get you a job.

So who cares whether it is a degree mill, btech, or Beng?

However the paradox is while actual work doesn't need the degree knowledge. HR and boss wants that piece of paper. As long as HR thinks Beng is better than Btech which is better than degree mill, then the value of Beng is there.

But honestly the truth is there is no difference in actual work performance between the three, coz the knowledge acquired is really not necessary.

If you still do not see the point that I am putting across, assuming that I am a ""emotional teenager"", perhaps your inability to comprehend my argument is the exact reason you spur us on by saying ""grades are not important"".

Old man, our studies do not simply comprise of ""regurgitat(ing) knowledge"". Granted, everybody knows the knowledge you learn in school, regardless of level might not be used for your future job or even tertiary education. The chemistry knowledge I learnt in JC definitely isn't fully applicable to the course I'm studying now. What the education system does succeed in however, is fulfilling the purpose of nurturing critical thinkers. The questions I tacked in A Levels set the foundations on how I should study, problems which come out of it and how I should solve it. Just like in uni, where a firm grasp of knowledge on my major would be a good indication that I can critically think in the field and perhaps contribute to the firm I join. 

More importantly, thank you to #61802 for your insight on the topic. I guess it does take a real life example to show people the reality of the situation, and I wish you all the best in your future career. Bottom line, grades do matter for most jobs as the first point of selection. What comes next (e.g. attitude and ability to work in a firm) will be judged AFTER grades were looked at. Typically, the people who say ""grades don't matter"" either really don't need them cos they are secure in their future, or are just trying to throw you off to study less for the bell curve.

A lot of you have commented (esp the guy who said something along the lines of it depends on what you do). I do acknowledge your point, and I did think about it. You are right by saying that everybody has different aspirations. After all, we cannot have a society full of doctors, just like how we cannot have one full of poets. But that brings me to the point I brought up in my original post. However, what mommy told me at the end of the day makes perfect sense; ""it doesn't matter how well you do, as long as you tried your best"". I admit that maybe me and the other guy might have made results sound like a means to an end. Thats not true, we are just saying that the notion of grades not being important is utter rubbish. At the end of the day however, there will always be people who do better than others. To the people who aren't doing well, as long as they have done their best, thats all that matters. To tell them however, that grades aren't important before they have even tried could lull them into a false sense of insecurity. Instead, EVEN IF WE KNOW that they are not at the top of their class, we should still encourage them to work hard, and the end product does not matter as long as they tried their best.

It might seem confusing but let me summarise my argument. 
(1) Grades do matter, I'm sorry but this reality will be here for a long time. 
(2) Grades are not means to an end. TRY YOUR BEST in whatever you do, thats what is important. If your aim is to be a world-class farmer, take a course related to it (hypothetically), and WORK HARD AT IT.

437,61688,"Nowadays when people ask me where I study, what I want to do in the future, what I am doing, I just act blur and dodge the questions. 

You know why? I used to discuss about different careers and their salary scales. Then some extras would say things like “if you want money then you shouldn’t do this job.” 

Bitch please? So you apply for jobs without knowing the salary ah? So I cannot discuss about salaries and career prospects of different jobs ah? And who told you money is the only reason why I am interested in this career? You very noble. You work with zero regard to salary. You go buy a beautiful bungalow without knowing the price ah? 

I also used to tell people my plans, like if I cannot get into job A, I would have job B as my 1st back up plan, job C as 2nd back up plan, etc. Then again some extras would comment negatively, “If B and C are your back up plans, then you shouldn’t join B and C. If you have no interest, please don’t join this industry.” 

Bitch please? So what you want me to join? So I cannot have a back up plan is it? So I can only have 1 career choice is it? I have only 1 bridge to walk is it? Can’t make it then how? You feed me ah?

This is like somebody says “if I can’t get into NTU REP then I will do Electrical Engineering in NUS as my 2nd choice”, then an extra asshole comments “if it’s your 2nd choice, then please don’t join electrical engineering.” Bitch please? 

Furthermore, who says I have no interest in B, C, D? If I have totally no interest in them they wouldn’t even be in my back up plan. If I have no interest then I wouldn’t even be having a hard time comparing pros and cons of each of them. 

Yeah so when people ask about my plans. I will just smile and say internally, “NOYB”.

Having that extra wealth would mean more/better access to materials such as tutors/study materials at the start. Can that be the deciding factor between a good student and a top student?

Lads, its a no for me after yesterday night. Despite spending over half a billion on transfers past 3 years, Manchester City still cannot get into the semis of the UEFA Champions League. They were beaten by a team whose only signing this season was a Korean player called Foo-Kin-No-Wan.

439,61685,"Hi, I'm an exchange student from the UK here for one year. 
When i first came to SG i expected people to be far more conservative than people in the UK and the west in general, mostly because of the differences between western and eastern culture. But the more i've been here, I've realise that people, at least where I stay, are far more liberal than I originally though, specifically when it comes to sex. 
In the UK fwb is almost unheard of, and cheating is also completely frowned upon, but over here, it seems to me than quite a large portion of people either had or have had a fwb at some. Why is this, is it because young people in SG have been controlled by overly conservative parents their entire life and just want to rebel when they go to University or what? 
Regarding the cheating, is it universally thought of as bad, or is there a more passive, nonchalant attitude towards it? If so, why?"
440,61682,"To add on to the OP of #61673:

I am from Btech, so take my answers with a pinch of salt, or not.

- watered down curriculum 

According to the SCALE website: 

""A module with module code TEExxxx is equivalent to the module EExxxx offered to the full-time students. Subject to the approval from SCALE and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, a student may select a full-time equivalent module in place of any TEExxxx module.""

(http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/school-of-continuing-and-lifelong-education/undergraduate-education/btech-engineering/bachelor-of-technology-electronics-engineering/)

Most mods are of TEE and are equivalent to the FT. equivalent. Yes, lecturers might offer some extra hints to the assignments, but structurally, the core of each mod is the same as FT. Anecdotally, I frequently see FT students who missed lectures in the day crash our lectures at night - the content is the same! Look, I've seen lumicast webcasts and close to 90% of the content is the same!

- Btech students have it easy because modules are graded easier

The biggest issues facing BTech students are actually of lack of time to complete assignments + do sufficient revision. 

Here's a typical schedule for BTech students:
8.30am - Wake up and head to work
5.30pm - Leave work for class
6 pm - Reach class, grabbing a subway sandwich along the way (wow it's been the 35th subway you've had this sem). Sit through a whole class on partial differential equations, electromagnetic wave theory, Maxwell equations etc (after a 8 hour work day no less)
9pm - Class ends! Phew, time to make the journey home
10 pm - Reach home and freshen up before going to bed

Repeat for 4 years, at least 3 times a week (including special terms for the first 4 semesters)

It's tough and hence explains the high attrition rate. Almost nobody puts in work day to day, and the bulk of the studying only happens a week prior to finals, where you're playing the catch-up game by then. Don't forget, every lecture is 2.5 hours densely packed with content, and we all know that attention span tapers off quickly after the second hour. Oh yes, tutorials after that too, sometimes past 9 pm. 

If btech mods were graded on the same rigour as FT students, honestly, most Btech students would find it hard to score/pass. FT students can revise with friends (almost impossible for BTech), go to the prof during office hours (sorry bruh at work), and generally have a nice supportive network to push each other higher. Most, if not all, BTech students are fighting this battle themselves, and apart from the occasional weekend study session (a week before the exam, no less), they're alone.

Knowledge in a field is quickly lost once you stop applying it. To those condemning BTech graduates for their supposedly 'lower quality' degree - try out a sample problem set from any of the mods you took in year 1. Can't do it? Think about what would happen when you start working for a year after your degree. Are the supposedly 'inferior quality' of the modules that much of an issue when you can't even recall what you studied?

While this does not give justification for the lower academic rigour of BTech, given that NUS is ranked so highly in the world, that's your high horse opinion that nobody gives a shit about. What's the alternative to BTech or a PT degree then? Working as a technician in a company earning about 2k a month with kids and a wife to feed (I know a few)? How about staying in the same role for years because you're stopped by your paper credentials?

TL:DR: 

To upgrade oneself is a necessity in this day and age, and BTech students are just trying to create opportunities for themselves to succeed. There's really no justification for being in a quaint little garden of the i-GrAdUaTeD-FrOm-NuS club trying to stonewall those who attempt to get in despite their trying circumstances.

But truly, who the hell cares what your opinion is? Yes, you studied hard in poly to get into FT, yeah you've got a CAP of 5.00. Not all btech students want to merely pass, and not all FT students get cap 5.00. There are exceptions to the norm everywhere, and this applies to Btech too.

We're all trying to carve our own niche in the world in our own unique way. Let's stop bringing each other down and being so salty.

I've been single for 5 years after my failed 7 years relationship. I can't seem to land a girl since then who will stay by my side, all of them just wants to have sex for a while then go.

Some of these girls have boyfriends or are about to get married and I only found out after having sex with them. I feel so guilty afterwards and it's also heartbreaking to find out that I was just a toy. Once in a while, they still text me to ask me if I want to hook up which I have politely declined.

Girls who are more of relationship material think I'm a playboy because I'm ""so charming"", and I never get to end well with them. One of them recently left after a couple of months of dating, because she thought she was not good enough for me.

I want a stable relationship and start a family, but is it true that some people on this earth will never get to experience a happy ending? I feel like I'm one of them and I feel like shit.

442,61678,"Adding on to internship problems, potential com science interns please pay extra attention on the job scope. It's common that companies abuse interns to clear the shit work that full time developer  ""do not have time to do"". But that said at least make sure the tech/framework you will be picking up is useful to you down the road.

I entered a german MNC with a vague AF job scope, forced to learn SAPUI5 frontend framework. The framework is old, heavy and shitty when compared to React, Angular, Vue. Reusability is near zero if you're not working for them. Worst part is none of the team (devs that are getting 6.5k-9k/month) have working knowledge of the framework they expect me to pick up and ship the project. 

Development skills are 80% self taught, given time we can learn and pick up any tech stacks. But we need to be selective and choose the tech stacks that has the best ROI. In short, learn from my suffering and make sure you get a concrete job scope before accepting the internship offer.

445,61673,"I have been reading the ""threads"" on this page, in particular #61673. 

I know his/her intentions probably meant well, and so do many others when they try to encourage those who might not have done as well academically. However, you all have become well... extremists in your own right.

If someone has not done well, it is incorrect to say that he will have no future, that he is a failure, that he is any less of a man (or girl) than a person who did better than him. However, there are some things we should be wary of.

Firstly, like it or not grades ARE A REFLECTION of how intelligent you are (academically), the ability to retain knowledge and to a certain extent how hard you studied. As mentioned by many of you, ""no one cares about your results or where you came from, only how much you can bring to the table"". However, grades are important to climbing the academic ladder, particularly when applying for courses in university. Getting into a good university (eg Imperial or Ivy League), top tier courses, or a government scholarship will require a good grade as a pre-requisite. To say that grades are not important in the future, would just be a lie and give students in their impressionable pre-teen and even JC students the false impression that ""I don't need to work hard since it doesn't matter in the long term"".

Secondly, we never ever put down the people who have done well, or downplay any of their achievements. Many people (including the OP who keeps discussing the BTech thing) seem to have the idea that grades are not important, that nobody cares in the future workforce. While this may be true in hindsight, it is not right to discourage or mock those who have done well, telling them that no one cares about their results. After all, most of them worked hard for their grades, so shouldn't we celebrate their achievements with them?

Lastly, just cause a few of us are ""arrogant"" and think of people who did not do as well as inferior, does not mean that all of us fall into that same category. How would you like it if I said all the people in low-demand courses ""lazy"" or ""stupid"". You wouldn't like it, just like how the people in better courses don't want to be universally classified under the arrogant category. 

To those not doing well academically, this is not directed at you. As long as we all achieve our maximum potential and feel happy about what we are doing, that is what really matters. To those who keep putting across the point that results do no matter (or along those lines), stop it. Your originally good intentions have turned extreme to the point where engaging in ""elite-lynching"" have become the norm of society today. 

P.S I noticed people on this page like to correct grammar when they cannot debate a point (or resort to some obscure line of mockery) so let me point out that in the last sentence, ""have"" should be ""has"".

455,61657,"Responding to: #61657. I think your argument and post is extremely problematic and counter-productive in improving the quality and support of local television. Yes, a large portion of the demographic captured by Mediacorp is comprised of members of the pioneer generation - but that's exactly and only because they're the captive market. Mediacorp has no competition for the viewer who has no access to cable television, or the knowledge or will to use the internet. Given the option of better programming, I have little doubt that older generations would also make the switch.

While you might be correct that there exist, at least in theory, a positive effect that might result from the covert PSAs littered in the storyline of local TV, you should also keep in mind (a) that it's exactly these PSAs that appear to turn off so many others from watching (if you care any at all about viewership from other demographics). (b) There is also equal opportunity for local tv to be used by corporate entities for covert advertising (read: unethical product placement). (c) It is doubtful that these efforts have any impact in encouraging cross-generational dialogue any way- the shows themselves certainly won't serve as a common topic if nobody under the age of 30 has ever watched them. And (d) there is a question about how accurate is their depiction of Singaporean worries and troubles if they only ever deal with these questions with the bureaucratically sanctioned sanitised kiddy gloves that appear to be issued with every show. 

The truth is that Mediacorp is losing viewers and will continue to lose viewers regardless of how people talk about it. Even the younger generations that you cite as once watching okto and kids central, now have smartphones and are internet-savvy enough to utilise YouTube. The solution to bring them back shouldn't be to remove their phones (though I think removing their phones is a good idea) and strapping them to a chair facing an okto original- it should be to improve programming to speak to the cultural and Singaporean-specific problems and worries that the youth have. If you want to support any product (local or not), your task shouldn't be to convince people to buy it regardless of its quality, it should be to support the improvement of the product so that it can stand on its own merits. And if the only people who watch it, are the people who have nothing else to watch, then it simply isn't very good.

Good art serves a purpose in society. It creates a shared national identity that transcends economic, racial, and generational differences; it serves as catharsis for the anxieties that are unique to the Singaporean experience. There's so much more that local television can be, and we do disservice to the industry if we say that we should support it regardless of what it's currently like. If you want to support the local tv industry, then demand more from the company, not the consumer."

470,61633,"Just needed a place to get this out of my head. 

Let me first state the obvious; 
Money means everything. 

It not only has the ability to give you immediate material satisfaction, but also gives second, third and fourth chances in life. Didn't study hard in O Levels? Its fine, just go overseas to an easier education system, compete among the weaker students. Messed up your A Levels real bad and can't make it into a course you desire in a Singapore University? Just go overseas to a less competitive one, and come back maybe several years later.

How can you say overseas students are any less intelligent than local students (pre A-levels) some of you may comment. Lets be realistic here. The education system in Singapore is analogous to a sieve, with each major exam being a filter. At the PSLE, all students competed against one another. When it comes down to the A Levels, the strongest of us remain, fighting for those few places in the courses we wish to pursue. Most of the students flying overseas are those caught in the sieve.

Is the purpose of the post to criticise the education system? Ironically enough, it isn't. While most people like to poke at the system, saying it is ""elitist"" and ""unnecessary stress"", it cannot be denied that when entering ANY university, grades are the easiest, most tangible method of ranking us.

I am not talking about students who go to Cambridge, Imperial or those top grade universities. I do not criticise the students who took less completive courses overseas because there is some truth to wanting to see the world in your youth. I am not talking about scholars as they earned their places. I speak against those who took the easy way out, could afford to fly to an unknown, less competitive university, pursue the course they desire, and then fly back, with the smirk satisfaction that they have achieved their dream career. You however, are no better than me, and definitely should not think of coming back to Singapore. Your foreign degree should not be recognised in Singapore when trying to get work as you are a heck lot dumber than our students.

Yes, I am salty as heck. But if I cannot buy the chances you all were given, at least let me having the privilege of ranting for free."

Cos the hints given out are not even substantial, it's really difficult to understand what concepts we're supposed to apply.

On the side note, I'm kinda surprised people are complaining more about CS2030 than CS2107 assignments. The latter is terribly awful."
473,61628,"Reading the whole saga about the FWB guy supposedly knocking up the girl and now debating who should take responsibility for what, it left a very sour taste in my mouth. 

You wanna know what's worse than that? Going abroad to study, thinking you'd be in a LDR with your GF back in Singapore for those three years and then come back to her. Only to get a message halfway into Freshers' Week when you're overseas settling into life there from your girlfriend telling you she's breaking up with you out of guilt... because apparently despite only being together three months earlier, despite her losing her virginity to you only two weeks before you flew off, and always using protection thereafter, she tells you that she somehow found out she was pregnant and that she's already gotten a chemical pill abortion without even telling you anything beforehand. 

Then drop everything you were doing there and buy air tickets to fly back to try and see her and salvage anything possible. Not even knowing if she was lying about the pregnancy because so much didn't seem right about her story, or if it was really true and you just lost your first child that you'd have gladly taken responsibility for. And the final kicker? Arrive back in Singapore, but never get to see her again because she freaked out about you actually being serious enough to fly back to look her up again, and getting her mother to turn you away and leave things irrevocably broken. 

Bonus part of this story: one year later you return to Singapore for summer holidays and somehow manage to meet up with your ex's close friend. And then you hear from her that your ex was never pregnant. That she made that whole story up because she feared that I would be attracted by Western girls overseas, and in her fear of being cheated on she decided to break things off first but somehow couldn't do so directly. Hence the cooking up of the fake pregnancy and abortion story, because somehow in society the stereotype is of guys knocking girls up but running away at the first opportunity to shirk their share of responsibility. Not expecting you to actually NOT be one of those stereotypical guys, not expecting you to fly back halfway around the world for her, not expecting that you were actually serious about keeping the relationship and possibly even the baby if it were a real thing. 

Yeah, this is the story of my life. This is a major reason why I'm so scarred when it comes to relationship and love. And to that confessor who actually dared to comment about how much money he spent on condoms in that confession, I really spit on you for being such a disgrace to us men, for your absolute lack in placing priority on the right things, and for your petty complaint and whining.

when you guys agreed to be in a free-from-responsibility relationship, was pregnancy in the picture? did she explicitly agree that if she got knocked up you will be FREE from ANY responsibility?? she asked you to take FULL RESPONSIBILITY and you're saying she's not shouldering any responsibility at all? don't be dumb she will be the one carrying the baby, going through the painful birth AND take care of the baby for life. if you run away like a coward she will face the stigma of being a single mum and YOUR CHILD will not have a dad. not shouldering any responsibility you say..?  

were you forced to fork out money for the condoms? obv not, you were probably excited to be using it when you bought them. do you want to claim ignorance that condoms are not 100% effective?

Also, I don't think that the profs can modify the module grading distribution at this point in time. 
Honestly though, this copying is somewhat predictable. Unlike the other 2, assignment 3 is a relatively difficult assignment with no plagiarism check mechanisms in place. Since only the final solution is marked, it becomes easy to mark, and it also becomes easy to copy and get away with it. 
In other words, the solution can be verified quickly, and the problem can be solved quickly.

498,61568,"To #61519 and any other people who are facing the same issue, as long as you two agreed to sleep together, you two should be responsible for it. It's mentally draining for girls to go clinics and deal with it alone. And it is unfair to push all responsibilities on the guys. 

To guys, a girl can't get pregnant without your sperms. The kid may not be in your body, but you still contributed to the creation of the kid. Go to the clinic with the girl, split the abortion fee, be there with the girl even after the abortion, just go through it together because it's the two of you who made the mistake. 

To girls, the kid is in you, you can't run away from the responsibilities even if you want to. So don't be delusional and say things like 'you got me pregnant!' You can't be pregnant if you don't agree to the sex. It's right to get your fwb to be responsible for it, but not fully responsible. If the guy is there with you throughout the whole journey, be thankful that you are not going through it alone. 

But honestly, if you have a kid, time is crucial. Get it over and done with and quarrel about responsibility later. If you two can't handle the responsibility issue now, you definitely do not want the child to grow bigger to the point where you can't have an abortion and have to talk about another form of responsibility. And if you don't feel old and mature enough to handle such responsibilities, don't get fwbs. "

It is one thing to take a personal preference as to the type of entertainment you wish to consume, but it is another to diss and deprecate the local entertainment industry altogether. 

We are a generation that grew up watching local television shows - be it kids central, okto, channel 8, suria whatever. We are lucky enough to experience development in technology allowing us to access netflix, amazon prime and youtube. But didn't this freedom in choice come with age and exposure to technology? Aren't the young children today still doing the same? Don't we hope that they have the same, wonderful memories and childhood that we all did? 

Another point would be the local entertainment industry, as with traditional media everywhere, is struggling to retain viewership as it is. If we don't respect our local entertainment industry enough to at least leave it alone when it doesn't align with our preferences, who will? If we don't support fellow Singaporeans, who will? 

Last point I promise. There is still much value in ""tacky"" television dramas. For the older folk who continue to draw much joy from them, these programmes are necessary for them to first, keep up with the times and second, understand the pioneer/merdeka generation stuff/CPF stuff etc. Young people claim that the older generation doesn't understand them - think mental health issues, modern day stresses. What if these are woven into the television programmes? what if they help your extended family become less judgmental during family gatherings for example - Would you still say the same about it? 

Not everything is about you, or even your generation. Just because you and your peers or even family don't take to it, doesn't justify your going around despising local entertainment. "

Hi OP, like you, I have also dealt with local grads, either through interview or interacting with some at work. While I agree that balancing a full time job and studying part time is akin to the stress of taking 5 modules per semester while balancing CCA's, it certainly does not justify the lower standards of BTech.

And yes, I was from BTech.

If you actually try to take a look at some of the midterm and exam papers, you would find that the standards of the questions were largely watered down. If you were to compare BEng and BTech papers, the difficulty standards are very very different. There is also the learning standards whereby for BTech, the profs are usually more lenient, in the sense that you can see students presenting horrible slides full of words and off the main topic, submitting horrible reports (copy paste from Wikipedia with no citation without removing the inline citations), even answering 1 out of 4 questions in the final exam and yet they can still score a C. Frankly even I would admit that this is unfair to full time students.

That being said, I have met fresh NUS NTU grads that cannot tell me what Central Limit Theorem is nor can they illustrate volume vs linear expansion. I have also seen employees from BTech that submitted technical report that aside from them adding colorful fonts, it can be jolly well written by a technician.

tldr: 
- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi"

523,61531,"I'm curious what people think of having mid-terms before recess week as opposed to after it. My take is that mid-terms occurring on the two weeks after recess week puts a lot of stress on students to keep up with the new lectures whilst still studying for the mid-terms, because as well all know, no amount of time prep is enough when the exam is still looming.

Mid-terms before recess week --
Pros: recess week lets students catch up and revise current content, maybe allows them to read ahead if the lecturer releases lecture slides early. Recess week is more chill since exam doesn't happen directly after, so less pressure to spend it mugging. Lecturers/TAs also have more time to mark papers during recess week. The lessons after recess week don't have the ""exam feels"" whilst attending them, that is, if you even attend them at all. Rewards students who are more consistent in the first half instead of cramming days before the exam. In my experience here, the content in the first half of the semester is usually easier than the second half, so easier to study for it.

Cons: Less study time before mid-terms for students. Forces students to keep up with the lesson from the start of the semester (can be seen as a pro depending on who you ask), probably resulting in lower mid-term scores on average. The module prep before semester starts likely more stressful since mid-terms occurs earlier, with no recess week ""buffer"".

Mid-terms after recess week --
Pros: More time to study, resulting in higher average scores. Allows students to catch up if they've been falling behind. Gives lecturers/TAs more time to set the mid-term papers.

Cons: Lecture attendance usually very low in week 7 and 8, causes snowballing for some students, especially those mods with 2 lectures a week. Less time to mark paper (more stress for lecturers/TAs). Recess week is a slog where you're pressured to study everyday for moar marks.

I believe NUS used to have mid-terms before recess week, before student complaints changed it to the current system (I believe the same happened to the SU system). I'm wondering if more people feel the same as I do, and prefer mid-terms to be before recess week."

534,61516,"Good evening to all. I'm the OP for #61516. 

For the past few days I had read through the various replies towards my post about BTech and I'm heartened to receive mostly positive reactions. But I believe there are a few points raised by various comments I should address.

But before I begin, please, please, type ""btech"" into the search bar and look at the all past post about btech. You would understand that there are students out there who do feel inferior, when compared to a BEng student. There are students who are lost, wondering whether to take up BTech. Remember that my post wasn't explicitly meant to glorify BTech. My post was to give an insight from an employer's POV and to motivate, albeit with a little bit of comparison between BTech and BEng. Because as I've mentioned, that post was triggered over a conversation that I overheard.

Some of you take it to challenge my POV and I welcome that. I have over 17 years of experience since I graduated from BEng and my POV is going to be a very direct one, from an ex-employee into an employer's POV.

Employers do not care how much hard work you put into to land yourself into NUS/NTU/govt universities.
Employers do not care how much you suffered while you are in school. Employers do not care how stress you were when you are taking 5 modules along with CCAs.
Employers do not care about the personal history and emotional baggage of all prospective interviewees and how they fought for placings.
Employers certainly do not care about your jealousy towards a particular individual who f*cked around during his younger days and managed to secure himself in BTech while you slog your life away in BEng, with a 5.0 GPA.

Remember, every hiring manager (probably) was an undergraduate once. We know the hardship. You are NOT special. We do not know you. You do not deserve our emotional attention on why you are more worthy just because you think you worked very hard for it.

Lets be practical. My company is like a bleeding wound. I need someone who can stop the bleed. Your hard work securing that 5.0 GPA and your water canoe (sorry for using you an example) CCA isn't going to help me with that.

Every year I have hundreds of students who apply for jobs. All highlighting about their GPAs and their merit achievements. Fair enough, that is all they have to showcase about themselves. Having those positive points in your resume only tells me 2 things. You are able to multi-task between school and other activities, and you did your homework before taking your exam.

When I hire an undergraduate, I expect them to think like an undergraduate. When I hire a graduate, I expect them to think like a graduate. When I hire a diploma graduate, I expect them to think like a diploma graduate. That is, you know your stuffs. Besides your theoretical knowledge on the subject, you have nothing to bring to the table to scale my company's business higher. With that piece of paper, you enter the workforce as a blank piece of paper and you go around demanding high pay while having sub-par knowledge and/or experience. Employers do not appreciate that. We need talents. We have budget. Sense of self-entitlement no? Elitist thinking that you are better just because you're from BEng?

Getting a degree is like a rite of passage for most of us. But it is a very carefully considered decision for full time working adults. Especially for long haul courses like BTech, where I'm aware that class sizes shrinks up to 50% to 60% from first year towards the last.

I do not doubt the quality that BEng offers. I certainly agree that BTech's curriculum stringency is watered down. To say that BTech students in general only want to pass is true as well. Which was precisely why I said the truth lies in the students themselves.

You can offer an incredibly quality content rich course like BEng. When you have students who graduated with flying colours, yet unable to perform their task as expected, it's a fail. You can offer a watered down BTech course. When you have student's who's goal is to pass and forget, is also a fail.

Like what one of our fellow OP said,

- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi


They're equally true. Whether they can bring the required knowledge and skills to the table, it's entirely up to them. To outright say that BEng is more superior than BTech is misleading. Likewise to say that BTech is inferior compared to BEng. 

At the end of the day, whoever can contribute most to the company, is favored most. (Copy, Paste)Employers looks for more than paper qualifications. The character, knowledge and skills that a BTech student presents, is worth more than a fresh graduate's first class hons. 5 years down the road, whoever can offer more of their skills and knowledge, whoever can display more achievements, goes to better places, be it a BEng or a BTech.


And for god's sake, can you students please stop with all these sexual dramas in school. Is that why my applicants mostly fail because they're more concern about having sex than actually studying. It is even more happening than K dramas.

Peace."

540,61509,"Hello I am the OP of #61474. I read the comments below and I just want to clarify that I did not know that I am in a pseudo-relationship until 3 months in. Basically I dated him, like go out every week, we even went overseas once together. I told my friends about him and they said he looks very honest and congratulated me for my new-found relationship. So I thought I was in a relationship, everyone around me thought that I am in a relationship. Because when we go out together we would also hold hands and take photos together. Until one of my colleague told me to go and clarify with him our status, then he said that we are just dating and not bfgf. And also I saw that he refused to delete the dating app and still uses it to talk to other girls. I felt duped and I don't know why I am being caught up in this situation. I saw some comments below saying I am loose... and I feel so sad. :("
541,61508,"Talking about health and relationships, is it normal for me not to want a relationship because I have health issues? I know of this guy who likes me and I like him too, however, I am unable to see myself in a relationship because I have poor health (and he knows it too)."
542,61507,"Many years ago, I just ended a relationship and started using dating apps out of curiosity. I met a guy who said that he was using it out of curiosity too. He had quite a plain profile, only one photo, nice scenery, him wearing tshirt, jacket and pants, his face slightly nerdy but good looking. 

He was a fresh grad with a reputable job and high pay and dreamed of building a start-up after saving up money. But he was humble, friendly and enthusiastic about the topics we discussed. 

Out of boredom, I asked if he wanted to meet up one day. After dinner at a mall, we spent hours talking at a nearby park. We hit it off and continued to talk after the meetup. 

One day I confessed to him that I was attracted to him when I saw him and he said he was also attracted to me. Maybe I was too lonely and horny, I asked him if he would like to be fwb and he agreed. 

Whenever I felt like hooking up, I would call him and he would travel all the way from the west to the east to find me. Every time he comes over, we would do the deed first and then spend hours cuddling and chatting until both of us fall asleep. He would hug me when he sleep until I wake him up for work in the morning. 

I always thought he was a fkboy and eventually I started dating someone and decided to cut off contact with him. However, he would try to reach out to me from time to time but I would ignore him. Then he stopped trying.

A few years later, we are both single and he just started his own business and we happened to bump into each other somewhere near my workplace. We had a nice chat over coffee. He asked me out for dinner that day and we chatted for hours. He was attentive and encouraging as I ranted to him about my struggles at work. At the end of the outing, he walked me to the lift and sent me a goodnight text when he reach home. 

A few days later, he asked me out and again we had a nice long chat. For the following days, he would text me every morning and throughout the day. I realised that I still had feelings for him after all these time. I felt really miserable because I assumed that maybe he wants to hook up just like last time.

So I told him I'm not interested in hanging out with him. To my surprise, he was very upset and kept asking me if he has done anything wrong during the past few days. He even confessed to me that he really likes me and he had feelings for me many years ago and even now. 

I find it really hard to believe him because he is such a good catch and I am such an ordinary person. And we had such a weird friendship to begin with. He spent hours trying to convince me not to give up on him and to give him a chance to date him but I insisted that we are very different people.

I really don't know what to do now. I felt like maybe he just wants to hook up and I also felt like we won't have a future because he just started his business and he mentioned that his priority is his business so he wouldn't want to settle down in the near future. Or maybe him saying his business is priority is actually just an excuse. I don't know what to feel now... "

547,61500,"This post is for OP#61472 :) 
Thank you for being being there for your friend.
I'm relieved to see that there are still people who cares for someone who has that illness. 
Your friend may be having difficulties to talk about it openly with his psychologist and counselor. Maybe, he is not comfortable with them and he does not like opening up to them. Perhaps, he does not want to go through the hassle of having to undergo treatments and medications. Maybe, he feels ashamed that he is not getting any better and it does not help that his parents are not rendering him any emotional support or any support that he needs. 
On your part, stick by him and try your best to persuade him to talk to his psychs and counselor. But please be patient, okay? While i know that you're having a hard time to talk to him, know that he's having it harder too. It is not easy for him to open up. In the meantime, gather the things that he have said to you and look out for him for any signs of suicidal thoughts. Try to explore his feelings and thoughts and help him discover healthy ways to express himself. The thing about someone who has depression, they can be smiling and laughing to your face, but that's really just the outer surface. For we are like the icebergs, we show people what we want people to know but inside of us, it's a different thing going on.
It seems like you're the only one he's got? Thus, he really needs you. It would be easier if his parents had accepted his condition and give him support, but sadly, it's not like that. 
I'm pretty sure he does not want to have severe depression either. 
If he exhibits signs of suicidal ideations, please don't turn your back on him and make his parents aware of it too. 
Anyway, i support the 1st person who suggested that your friend write it out. :) 
For the person who commented ""Call police to send him to IMH"", that's not what you do first. It will not help him by doing that. 
In this world where you can be anything, be empathetic. If you were not able to relate to their feelings, then be kind and understanding. 
Do not judge what you don't understand. 
People with mental illness do not want to have it also. It's beyond their control. So, people, please show some support? They need it the most.
I will end my long post by wishing you and your friend the best, okay? Things will get better. It may not be so soon, but it can eventually.
Sending love to you!

548,61499,"Since its coming to the last week of school, I just wanted to share a short story of working together in a group. I was working in a group where we all know each other (""kind of""). Unfortunately, we had to do a group project in a topic we were not very familiar with. Even worst, over the past few weeks, I realized that they weren't putting in much effort at all and sometimes I feel like just tanking this shit alone. I guess everyone started to have their own priorities and academics, group projects no longer become something they would want to prioritize. I found myself stuck in this situation where I still want to do well and just had to put in extra efforts to make sure the project is not a complete failure but a part of me has also given up. I was doing the project with this one other friend and another group came up to us and asked where were our other group members. I was kind of surprised by how my friend who was with me at that point of time has responded. He said that they had other important roles and things that were contributing in the project but a part of us, I am almost sure knew that they had not been doing anything significant. Honestly, I felt that he was such a great friend trying to cover the backside of others. HAHA. But really, if it wasn't for him I would have started complaining. Oh well. Guess we all have this kind of groupmates in some point of our life in university. One that covers your ass and one that doesn't give a shit.

558,61478,"After reading #61466, I would like to add on. 

I think couples should do genetic testing before marriage because who knows what deleterous allele and gene does your SO have? 

Your SO might look fine phenotypically but genotypically, she might be a heterozygous carrier of a nasty recessive allele. 

Don’t you think it’s dangerous to reproduce with such people and risk having a kid with congenital defect? This is even more important for people with certain religions that forbid abortion. 

What’s wrong with genetic testing and choosing SO with no deleterious gene? Why is it frowned upon? I don’t think it’s logical to love someone unconditionally and end up having to take care of special need children for the rest of my life. I don’t get why people criticize me... What’s wrong with my thinking? 

(Of course, I will do testing too. If I have deleterious recessive gene too, I will not reproduce as well because I don’t wanna bring suffering to innocent kid. Alternatively, I will find a person with homozygous dominant alleles in that gene loci to mate). "

“It is hard when you put in effort to get everything going well, but if you miss out on one thing, it is the only thing that is focused on. People don't appreciate all that you have done but they blame you for what goes awry.” 

First of all, thank you for your hardwork contributed in nursing people back to health. :)

I believe healthcare workers can all relate to this. Some may say that this happens across all jobs, but let me tell the readers that it happens the worst in healthcare.

We (aka Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses, Therapists, Dieticians and all allied health workers) are frontline workers who are battling life-and-dearh situations all the time, and even if not critical, we are healing people back to their normal health. Healthcare is a depressing place, because nobody comes here except the unwell, diseased or injured. People don’t thank us when they recover from their sickness, because it is expected that they will recover and walk out normally. But when a mistake is made, patients immensely blame us because they often overreact and immediately associate a mistake with death or serious health consequences to their loved ones. Even colleagues are harsh on each other.

In reality, being in Singapore with top healthcare facilities, services and professionals, we as healthcare workers pride and push ourselves to be perfect, so most mistakes are those which will not affect the patient negatively in terms of health outcomes. When detected, we’re quick to resolve it, cause “patients first”. 

My main points to the readers are:
- If you are from non-healthcare, both healthcare workers and admin staff would benefit from some form of appreciation from you. Even the most simple thank-you goes a long way for us ????, especially when we face sick, grumpy and unhappy people everyday. (Who comes into clinics/hospital happy?!) 
- if you are from healthcare careers, remember to give each other pats on the back and be optimistic. Optimism is something really lacking in our industry, which i admit i forget at times as well.

Long post but thank you #61440 for your contributions as a Nurse. Even if you are thinking of quitting, hope you get a vacation soon to rest your health!

But KNS ended up the account got fixed after CNY, so all the debts all erased mah! Then ofc I can't ask her for the money because (i) like it's so cheap of me to chase back 1 small meal (it wasn't anything fantastic) and (ii) the CNY mark passed to the debt is erased then if the debt is still valid then is like I sabo'ed her into bad luck right? 
So actually it's just a small meal so I can't really be bothered, but then I'm scared I offended her because like those very strong independent girl refuse to let guys pay for them right? And I understand la it's not like I'm her bf or anything so no good reason for me to chia her also...
So my conscience is clean cuz I didn't pay to ""preserve my fragile manhood"" or ""preserve the patriarchy"" or whatever lame shit, but I do feel like it was just a stupid story so quite funny share wif u all lor...

I saw a piece pretty big piece of seaweed from their stall lying on the floor in front of the stall, the walkway where many people walk. Then after a few minutes, the cashier lady (the one usually in red and wearing a cap) nonchalantly pick it up with her bare hands and immediately toss it back into their seaweed bowl. Hilariously, 5 minutes later an entire piece of capsicum dropped from their stall and rolled onto the same place on the floor. A passerby picked it up for them and placed it next to their cash register. Unsurprisingly, I later saw the cashier lady placing it back into their capsicum bowl without washing. One may argue that these ingredients are raw and once picked by the customers, they would be cooked. However, it just seems to me that this is no excuse to have such poor hygiene standards, even doing it in full view of everyone even though it wasn't crowded at that time. Before this, I did hear of people saying the utown mala has poor hygiene standards but this is the first time I saw it myself.

608,61380,"With regards to the discussion on MA2101, I think that it is really undeniable that Prof Zhang is really a nice, polite, humble and dedicated teacher. We all can see his passion and good insights on the subject his is teaching and also his desire to impart all these to the students. But let's be fair and separate the two issues. Being nice has really got nothing to do with how well you teach and handle the course.

I am someone who had followed him for two modules in two semesters. I really appreciate his good characters as mentioned above but as for the subject content itself I would rather say that it really does not meet the expectation set by the course itself and it is really disappointing for someone who wishes to gain more from this kind of supposedly enlightening course, apart from those things that can be learnt through self study. 


Yes to some people there might not be an issue to go through the lectures, look at the examples and computations he does in class and do well in the exam. Some people would be satisfied and think ""they learn"". However, to others this might not be the expectation of ""learning"" in this course. For people in math, you would realize that modules like fundamentals, linear algebra and analysis etc are really the foundations that provide a framework and overarching structure. And of course this course is set with the clear goal of theoretical rigour and proof techniques. I would rather agree with the opinion that Prof Zhang really needs to think about how he can deliver the messages you wish to bring across better.

All in all, it is really a matter of persepctive and what you wish to get out of the course.

To Prof Zhang if you are reading this:
You are really very nice. Please be sure that we are not trying to be mean or picky to say all these. But if there are things that can be improve on, why not?

621,61356,"I’m a first-year Electrical Engineering student.

Currently, I’m not overloading. I’m doing 22 MCs. I have no CCA. However, I’m still struggling. Meanwhile, my friends who are overloading with double major programmes or Industrial Design Programme with CCA are doing better than me.

I personally know another guy who spends only five minutes on maths homework and not worrying about exams. I think that’s quite cool and isn’t not sweating about the next homework or test a good feeling?

Arduino doesn’t make any sense to my eyes. ‘Generate Bitstream’ to me actually means ‘Generate cryptic error messages and bugs’.

622,61355,"How does one confess to the guy/girl they like without making the friendship awkward should there be a rejection? Is that possible?

I've been thinking about this for quite a while now. There's a friend I've been crushing on for about 2-ish months now, and we're pretty decent friends (from my POV). He's a really matured and fun but a wise person that brings people comfort when you talk to him (online, since he's currently not in school because of SEP) and I enjoy chatting with him.

It seems like a real dead case because we haven't spent a lot of time together before he left, and from how he speaks in a more social environment, he doesn't seem to see me that way? (Or should I spend more time hanging out with him when I can after he comes back?)

One of the biggest fear of confession is probably the fact that it could ruin any friendship between the two people, so I was wondering if there's any way to confess without ruining the friendship. I wanted to try the April's Fool method, but I figured not to. Ultimately, even if he doesn't see me this way, I want to keep this friendship. He's a friend I treasure dearly and I don't want to lose him just because of an unmatched feeling I have for him."

It's a course designed for ppl with non-IT background to have a career switch. I realize that what I am learning is quite broad but not in depth. Will that be enough to secure a job after graduation if I just learn what I was taught in school? If not, what should I prepare or learn before graduation to find a (better) job in the IT industry?"
626,61347,"It really broke my heart when I listened to what Dr Henry Chia said in the 2030 lecture. It pained me to see someone so nice (and is very capable at teaching) broke down like that. If you are a current 2030 student, I hope you can say something encouraging either face to face or via email. If you are one of those people who ranted on whispers about him, I hope you reflect from this and have the decency to apologize to him face to face. Dr Henry Chia is a good person and he deserved so much more than this."
627,61346,"Math Department please look into MA2101. MA2101 is such a nightmare this semester, not that it is hard and I can't take it. 

I believe that we all need to take English tests and pass or excel to certain levels to get into university and we as science students need to take SP1431 also. Why then does someone teaching a module alone can't even form a single complete sentence that is unbroken and grammatically correct? Go and watch the webcast and you will see how terrible it is. 

Math is so delicate and this is a theory course. Even the use of word ""the"" requires a proof of uniqueness and yet the lecturer uses it so haphazardly. And how amazing it is that the lecturer can't even pronounce and spell basic mathematical terms correctly. e.g. ""polynomial"" is always pronounced as ""polynominal"", ""subtraction"" is ""substraction"", ""2D-plane"" is spelled and pronounced as ""2D-plan"", etc. He can't talk with clarity, let alone explain concepts and teach a theoretical course on Linear Algebra.

Again, people might say we should be independent learners. But, I didn't say I am not learning it independently or I can't learn independently. I am saying, he is not doing his job properly. These are two completely different stories. Math dept, it is such a pity to turn away people who are still interested in such dry realms of thereotical math in this era. "
628,61343,"I personally think that Prof. Chia had been doing a really good job for the module CS2030. I am not saying that this module is perfect. There are definitely a lot of things that can be improved. It is unfair to rant about Prof. Chia as if he had been doing a bad job. I believe he had been very supportive to the students taking this course. In terms of workload, it is definitely not light, but for this module, I believe the deadline for the assignments are quite okay. In terms of practical exam, I do admit that it was quite tough. I am not saying this because I could do the exam well. I could not even pass level 1 for the second practical. I am not sure how others do for this practical. In my opinion, I do think that the question is difficult to understand. I personally could not even understand what the question wanted us to do. This explains why I could not even pass level 1. Personally, I do think that for the second practical assessment, the question should have been much clearer. It would have been better if it was clear. I myself could not understand the question and there was no way I could think of how to solve the question in the first place. However, it is UNFAIR if anyone complain that Prof. Chia is a bad prof simply because of this one practical. Just because of one unclear  practical (this is my opinion), how can you say that this prof is bad. I do hope that he could do something to help us understand the question, or rectify this problem. But, the practical has passed as well. I also do not think there is much he can do regarding the second practical. The only thing he could do now is perhaps only the grading/marking. I believe that he knows what he needs to do about this. He is a good prof. I just hope that people won't accuse him so badly without concrete base."

My work is not hard per say, but requires an amount of specialist knowledge that cannot be gained in school/self research. 
Recently, I have found myself dreading to go to work, and have been questioning why. Here's what i came up with:
1) I don't find my work meaningful. All i do is send emails everyday and/or do reviews. I wanted to do something that makes a difference, like helping people, contributing to SG in a direct way etc.
2)I was just recently posted to my current location a few month ago. My upper study is a terrible teacher that cant teach for nuts. Her method is basically to ask me to read pages and pages of manuals/contracts/SOP, and when you ask a question, her first reaction is 'I thought you read already?' The worst thing is I can only learn from her since she has the specialized knowledge. 

Yes I am aware that I have it good. I know that some of my peers are still looking for a job. I know that some of them are unable to get a salary of  4.2k monthly. I know that I should count my blessings that i don't have to go to Tuas or Pasir Ris for work everyday. However, I still can't help but feel miserable when i go to work. Does anyone have any advice?

697,61217,"This post is with regards with recent 'discussion' regarding women's choice of clothing, sexual crimes and attitudes towards them.

I feel that everybody, men or women, has their own opinion on this matter. On one end, there are people who believe that women should dress modestly to protect themselves from being targeted by sexual predators (not victim-blaming, just for precaution), and the opposing group who believes that women should wear however they want and not be subjected to fear of sexual crimes. But I feel that things are not as black and white as these may seem.

I propose that everybody has a comfort zone between (and including) these stances (kinda like a slider). If you are very afraid of sexual predators, wrap yourself like a pochong. If you value your freedom of expression of style, feel free to dress however you want. I don't understand why external parties want to impose additional (negative) values to people who disagree with them. (For e.g. the post which claims ppl to be self-entitled strawberries who believe that personal safety is an entitlement)

The very purpose of my post was to set up some basis of moral evaluation so good job everyone that pointed that I'm being fairly idealistic. However, on the topic of precaution which extends to basic acts like locking your car door etc etc, I've come to understand why some of you pin the same amount of blame on a robber and negligent car owner.

But we're talking about basic ethics here - maybe DON'T steal or r*pe etc etc etc. Granted, I'll edit my previous stance: if you walk out on the streets with a sign saying please stab me vs if someone stabs you because you were just walking around (yes i'm avoiding talking about r*pe), an instinctual response that ""oh you were literally?? asking to be stabbed??"" is warranted. That being said, we (or rather only some of us, judging by the comments) DO recognize the act of murder is inherently wrong.

I'm an NUS undergrad, whose faculty does not comment on NUSWhispers often (always studying). My seniors are way too busy and don't come to school most of the time so they don't really read this page. But I do read this page for entertainment sake and let me say that I really love this page. The thought processes and reasoning evident by the unique netizens in the comment section here is well... unique. Needless to say, it is very different from the opinions and arguments which my faculty mates and I have (by many many many miles).

In my faculty, brains and critical thinking are a must if I want to communicate effectively with my peers, and not receive those judgemental ""what are you talking about"" eyes.
Here, it seems that the same method of argument does not apply! If the amygdala hijack mechanism taught briefly in school needs a prime example, most of the netizens here would be it.

Personally, the comments here are like a break from work. In school, I analyse different problems and pains people face, and how I could better help them when they consult me. But here, I look at the arguments/advice posed by netizens, and try to reason out these thought processes.

Let me tell you, the latter is undoubtedly more puzzling, albeit infinitely more entertaining.

Go ahead, criticise my imperfect enGRISH.

Am I the only one who feels this way? Or am I holding local girls to standards too high for them to meet? I'm sure there must be local girls with strong distinct personalities, who can both give and take opinions intelligently and with conviction, who are well-read and spoken, who have dreams and aspirations and purposes in life that go way beyond surviving month to month, and who aren't subscribing to that old trope about Asian girls being sexual prudes or so passive that they need the guy to make the first move in love and in bed before they know what to do or say for their own enjoyment and satisfaction.

2) “It’s not the materialistic things in life that matter. Have you learnt the learning of love?”

3) “marks, marks, marks. Just cold, hard figures, right? Don’t you know other stuff humans live for? What is music, what is love, what is art? These are what feed our soul, not marks!”

I snapped out of my state as a cold-hearted robot who only knew how to achieve cold, hard, marks. I decided I’d stop being so opportunistic, who would give up love, enjoyment, music and art for those high marks which eventually mean nothing. 

I didn’t want to work towards being a cold sociopath who’s all for numerical grades and cares nothing about love. Yes, I’m “distracted”, but so? Should we just do things that are “useful”? 

Entering NUS soon. I didn’t study at all since age 15. I spent all my after school hours watching romance dramas and dating. Because love, not money, makes the world go round. "
729,61160,"In light of all the angsty retorts due to the recent Z's case, as evident from this page, I would like to give some of my perspectives on this issue.

I grew up in a relatively conservative Asian family, and I would consider myself a feminist. However, for the past few years, I have been afraid to tell people that I am a feminist, and even to the extent of being afraid to admit that I am one. 

As a female who has seen and witnessed many forms of sexism, be it in school or society, I was drawn to advocate for the idea of feminism, the ideal society where females are seen as equals as male. I attended an all girls secondary school, and it was very easy to find friends who resonated with my perspective. Fast forward to my adult life, I realised that the moment i mentioned that i was a feminist, I would be met with a startled and perhaps disgusted response from my male counterparts, and sometimes even my female friends will ask me to drop it.

As an adult now, I do understand why the word 'feminism' is such a taboo topic, especially in Singapore where females are not as blatantly disadvantaged as compared to other societies. Some might even argue that females have a greater advantage compared to males, as evident from the rising reported cases where females accuse the male of r***, even though it may not have happened at all.

Truth is, I do not know how to feel about the phrase ""victim blaming"" anymore. Bottomline, the way a girl dresses does not warrant an invitation to be harassed, and if you disagree with that you are an a**hole and deserve to be incarcerated. Sexually harassing a female when they are vulnerable, e.g. drunk, is not justifiable, and like i mentioned before, you deserve the full brunt of the law.

However, the grey area begins when consent is involved. What warrants a consent for s**ual intercourse? I mean for starters, I don't give verbal ""yes you can go ahead"" consent before I do it with my boyfriend. But under the Singapore law, I have the ability to sue my bf for rape, and maybe even get him charged. Hence, I do recognise the grey area in such situations, and herein lies the crux of the problem. 

In many many cases, when a girl reports being harassed, the authorities usually do not charge the guy due to lack of evidence of denied consent. And that sucks, it really does. It makes me scared as a female, scared that one day something does happen to me, and my perpetrator can get away scott free, while I am just labelled as ""the girl who made a false claim"".

However, I do recognise the circumstances in which this can be exploited, which is why although I am a firm believer of consent, I also believe that we females should not land ourselves in a situation where the need for consent is blurred. Examples would be going overseas with someone and sharing a bed, locking both of yourselves behind closed doors in a room, making obvious sexual advances throughout the night in an isolated place. Even though your intention may not be s**, but just know that there is a very weak case for you if anything does happen.

In the case of Z, I was more alarmed by the fact that the ""innocent before proven guilty"" law did not apply to him. From what I heard, he lost his sponsorship and his housing accommodation in school, amidst circumstances where many victim's stories were debunked and said to be untrue. I do not know what to believe, because this applies to the grey area of consent which I aforementioned, but it is just scary to think that social media now has the ability to destroy someone before the facts are even verified.

Although I did mention that many of such cases usually go unreported or even dismissed by the authorities, is this really a step forward? With anonymous accounts sending anonymous stories, is that really the truth? 

Welp, I'm just confused rn. Hopefully that dude gets what he deserves if the stories are indeed true, but if it isn't, I fear for the future of our generation and how there will be a shift of sentiment to ""guilty until proven innocent"". In any case, cheating is wrong, so screw you dude."

I seemed to have developed feelings for girl A. I definitely enjoy hanging out with her. On the other hand, I'm starting to recall memories of my ex, which are stirring up emotions. I'm confused if I really developed feelings for girl A, or it's just dormant feelings of my ex creeping back.

737,61145,"I recently took a module on IE2100, Probability Models with Applications. It was perhaps the most unfair and unacceptable test that any NUS student can take. Let me explain why: 
Firstly, students who arrive in the exam lecture theater before the start of the exam can immediately start the paper. As some students effectively arrive 30 minutes before the paper, they are allocated 30 minutes more to work on their mid-term.

Secondly, the lecturer provided ""hints"" on the projector screen without telling students about it. This lead to around half of the cohort which did not see the hints on the projector at all as they simply referred to their question paper which they took from the lecturer. Some students also did not see it as they were sitting at the back of the lecture theater, which make it hard for them to look at the projector screen, as it was assumed that the lecturer was flashing the same ""question paper"" as what was given to students.

Upon complaints by students after the end of the paper, the lecturer stated that he will reward the final grade base on the higher of the scores from either the mid-term or the finals. However, this leads to a systematic unfairness for students who did not see the ""hints"" as during the finals, all the students will likely be given the same question paper. This will make it exponentially hard for students who did not see the ""hints"" to catch up to their peers.

743,61129,"I'm a student who is in serious need of some welfare now. CS2040 is way too difficult, I have absolutely no idea why we need to learn data structure and algorithm when our code works. It is just that little time difference and we have to learn all kind of sorting and searching, and things get way uglier when the sit in labs and PE are close for me to fail this mode. Furthermore, this mode has prerequisites which I am unable to S/U and is graded by the ruthless code grading system, CodeCrunch. What I am about to say is, the PE has made CodeCrunch down for hours and I can't even login to finish my CS2030 assignments and good luck to those taking 2040 this semester and I have absolutely no idea what I am talking about."
744,61128,"Hi again, I'm the OP of #60907 (FANG data point). I posted my comp data with the best intentions, but somehow, they were misconstrued into something totally inaccurate. I find myself trying to slay the Hydra, where more heads appear as I cut them off. So let me share more details to shed more light:

My salary figures are not exceptionally high. If you can't ask your friends for these figures, you can always check out levels.fyi. They crowdsourced starting salary figures for each company and each level (including indeed). My salary is definitely within those band for the corresponding levels. Maybe on the lower side for the levels where I was promoted.

The taxes I quoted are accurate, and do include Social Security Tax (6.2%), Medicare Tax (1.45%), and Medicare Surtax (0.9%). It's easy to question how is it that I have such a ""low"" effective tax rate. The answer lies in the word ""effective"". While everyone's tax situation is different in the US, there are a few standard ways in calculating and reducing your tax liability:
- Taxable income is quite different from gross income. It is subjected to deductions. The basic deduction is just to take the standard deduction of 12.2k (pegged to inflation). So, my taxable income is reduced to 317k - 12.2k = 314.8k
- I maxed out my Traditional 401k contribution of of 19k. 401k is the US equivalent of CPF, but voluntary. Income that I divert to my 401k account is tax deferred. That means I reduce my taxable income this year by 19k, and any withdrawals at retirement are treated as income. I won't go into details of 401k, but at retirement, your income is so low that the tax rate for your 401k withdrawal is also around the 10-12% range in the future. So, now my taxable income is 286k
- Social security tax is only applied to your first 132.9k of your income. The limit is pegged roughly to inflation, so in 2016, it is applied to your first 118.5k of your income. This also means that for 2019 I'm going to pay 8.2k in Social Security Taxes (or 2.6% of my expected income of 317k).
- Medicare tax is 1.45% applied to all gross income (4.6k for 2019)
- Medicare Surtax is applied to taxable income above 200k. For 2019, I expect to pay $774
- Federal taxes are progressive. This means that you pay 10% on your first 10k of taxable income, 12% on your next 20k, and so on. Even though I'm in the 35% tax bracket, my effective federal tax, after all deductions, is 75k (or 24% of Gross)
- Adding all taxes together I get 89k, or 28% of Gross.

Sales tax is ~10%. No question that this is higher than in Singapore. However, groceries are not taxed, and I don't spend much in general. Fun fact: I buy a year's supply of shaving kit whenever I'm back in Singapore as you have no idea how expensive those razors are.

Jordan Dea-Mattson's calculation of 50-60% taxes is just plain wrong. Perhaps his back-of-napkin calculation used marginal tax rate, and unlimited SST + medicare surtax + no 401k contribution. If there something big I'm missing here, please let me know because I'll need to file a correction on my tax returns before I get deported.

Point is, I'm just another guy offering another data point. Most of data here (taxes, rent, salary bands) can be verified on the Internet. You just need to put in the effort to actually do those calculations.

PS: I could do an AMA over NUSWhispers to answer any other questions about my comp if there is enough interest. When there is sufficient responses, I'll try to answer as long as I can anonymize my identity and company."

What are your thoughts about a girl asking a guy out?

749,61117,"Just saw that NUS economics society is giving out welfare packs with metal straws and reusable containers and I’m honestly kinda disappointed. Other events have given out these things which has just led to great wastage because a lot of people already own a set of metal straws and reusable containers (most ppl have Tupperware anyway)!! And the number of times you have to reuse a container to outweigh the carbon footprint of a disposable has been proven to be really large (mostly in the thousands depending on what materials). While the thought is great, the effects aren’t. I doubt the containers and straws were sourced locally as well and the shipping would’ve hurt the environment more. Ironically, econs students can take the environmental economics module, would’ve expected them to do better at weighing costs and benefits :(( I rly hope you guys find a way around this! Perhaps split up the welfare pack and straws/containers so people who won’t use them won’t take them!!!!!

I think the right thing to do is to place my hand faced up beside hers and she'd flip the coins into my palm. However, my brain kinda farted and I used my hand to directly grab them from her palm. Even worse, somehow my hand-eye coordination went haywire too and I extended way too far, almost to her wrist.

753,61108,"After reading many relationships post here, I would like to remind girls to think twice before getting a boyfriend or husband who is younger than you. 
One simple reason is you are going to look older and much older when the time comes. Ladies age much faster when they hit 30s and if they give birth late. Given the current statistics, many girls are getting married later in life and that meant most will give birth late too. For man, their appearance stays about the same from 30s to maybe late 40s so they appear to age slower. Therefore, imagine you looking like a 40 y/o auntie but your husband looks like your younger brother in his 30s.
Next, is sex life. This might be a taboo for many or the issue wasnt raised to be heard. The older generation may or may not face the issue but it is highly unlikely that they would share this with us if they had the problem. Back to my point. Females face menopause earlier in life, many in their 40s now. Their sex drive drops tremendously and it also hurts in bed due to biological reasons. However, most males do not face this problem and their sex drive remains high till 70s or even older. Now, do you see the age gap in difference? 
Could this shed some light on why old men like to date young girls? All the ONS and mistresses?  
There are also news on man beating up wife for refusing sex... 
People always say that age is just a number, but I hope that this gives the girls an extra considering factor when choosing a boyfriend and their future spouse. 
I am open to anyone's opinion on this issue but please no trolling, thanks. "

If you thirsty girls dint give him the opportunity to play around with you, then we might not have the outcome that is currently happening now.

It is obvious that you girls like the thrill of playing with fire. For example, you get in the room with him one to one (even though u know his character) and all the other acts that give the other party the wrong impression. 

Don't play with fire and afterwards complain why did you get burned by the fire. Ask yourself this question, who was the one that lighted the fire in the first place?(:

762,61095,"i will be matriculating into NUS this year as a freshman. While this piece of news may serve as a joy for many others, but for me,i am in a dilemma. 

I feel like friendships are very important, especially when you are studying full time.  Through my experience, having friends are actually one of the main highlights of studying full time

However i feel like i have this friendship curse. In Poly, i come from IT school. In that kind of place, you do not get many opportunities to make new friends. This is because in my opinion, the people there are just... they just like to be alone and do not like socializing.

 Even within my small social circle, we only talk when there is school and rarely hang out with each other during the holidays.In my honest opinion, i feel like i have no friends at all in poly.

I am very afraid that the same thing will happen to me once i enter nus. FYI, i will be under the school of computing.If this is the case, i rather just study part time and continue working in my current intern company. This way, although i have no friends, but i am at least earning an income and enriching my working experience.

 I feel like this is much better than studying full time, as compared to studying full time and then having no friends and then when it comes to holidays,i will have to find odd jobs like giving tuition which honestly, does not allow me to earn much and neither does it boost my portfolio as well.

Any advice?

fast forward 2-3 years later, i finally had the courage to ask my friend about her experiences w the dude and she told me how manipulative he was and he did to her exactly what he did to me. she asked me why didn't i tell her about him then and wow i immediately felt so bad.

While you called other guys selfish, you are the real manipulative and selfish guy. It might be wrong to break up couples but should the girls just stick with their Boyfriends even if they know that their boyfriends are not the one they should be with? You are afraid of losing her and you don’t care whether she would be happier with someone else. Your love is selfish. True love should be wanting best for her even knowing you are not the one."

795,61044,"When I hang out with my friends lately, I've been having the thought that they are not the type of people I want to hangout with... e.g. that girl A from grp A talk about people and spreading unhappiness; that girl B from grp B chases monetary wealth and despise people of lower income. 

I feel guilty whenever I have these thoughts because I acknowledge that no one is perfect and each of them have their merits too: Girl A is a straightforward and honest person, girl B is an ambitious person and stay true to her goal.

While I want to accept my friends as who they are, I also believe the saying that 'you are the average of 5 people you spend the most time with'. There are parts of those friends that I admire and there are parts that I do not want myself to be associated with.

798,61040,"Here's my relationship story that I've always wanted to tell but find it difficult to share with other people. I have been together with my girlfriend since sec 4, so yea it's a long relationship by modern standards. When I first knew her, she was a cheerful, down to earth and happy go lucky girl. We have been through many ups and downs together, surviving through JC (we went to different JC) and my army periods. Fast forward to today, she has graduated from NUS and working for 2 years while I'm in my 4th year since we are of the same age. The issue is this, she has changed so much, so much so that she's almost a different person from when we started. The biggest transformation occurred when she started working. She's now a highly ambitious, high achieving career woman who enjoys the finer things in life. She's climbed so fast in her career that she's now earning about 2.5x the average starting salary expected for my course. Whenever we are together, I feel so alien and have a feeling as if I am talking to a familiar stranger who is so high up and dominating. It's as though I am talking to a boss. I really feel like quitting as I know that she is almost unlikely to change even after getting married. It's very hard for me to accept that I'll be signing up to live with a big career woman forever as I'll very much prefer to live a low key and simple life by earning enough to live an average lifestyle. Yet something is holding me back from cutting it all off on account of our so many years together and I wonder if it is easy for me find another girl to start all over again. I also have practically zero friends and social life as I've invested so much into the relationship. I feel so torn and stuck in this muddy situation. Can someone help me out?"

801,61037,"My boyfriend and I are together for 3 years. Just 8 months ago, he was offered an opportunity to work in US for 2 years and asked me to follow him and maybe settle down there as there is a chance that he may work there long term. I didn't do it as I have my own career in Singapore.

I thought we will be fine, but fast forward 8 months, I'm really lonely. Sure, we do skype about once a week. But we seldom text, due to the mega time zone difference. Sometimes, I want to tell him something that made me upset or sad during work, but that will be the time he is sleeping and can't respond to my texts until the next 6-8 hours. As the day dragged on, whatever negative feelings I have dissipated and I no longer feel the urge to tell him. That feeling of loneliness when I know that he isn't quite there for me is real. I also felt we are slowly drifting apart.

I guess he is coping well enough without me by his side, and often when I watched his insta stories he would be at some bar with a bunch of colleagues around him. He seemed really happy,  and sometimes I wonder if I should let go of this relationship since we doesn't seem to be walking in the same path in the future anymore. 

I really don't think I can stay in a LDR, and at the same time I do not want to give up my job with my good friends around too. And I know that it is unfair for me to ask him to come back to Singapore. I love him, and I want the best for him, and whatever makes him happy.

Hoping to ask some opinions so I can think a bit more about it, please be nice to me!

FOR TAKING PART
1) I'm actually a beginner in the sport, but I have a lot of experience in other sports so actually I can sort of get by in spite of my inexperience. I am legit ""not too bad"" so I would find it wasted to not take part.

2) I really like this sport, and I always wanted to have a ""cool guy"" image but actually in school days I was always quite fat and slow and gross so I want to test myself here and prove that I am a cool guy who possible to represent SG in something. My grades are quite shit anyway so I really want to have something to show for my youth and I don't want to be a regretful old fart next time. Esp because the world championship is only 1-in-4-years.

3) If I get selected, I would get to go to other country for competition, which is very cool. Even if I don't get selected, I would have fun at the tournament.

AGAINST TAKING PART
1) As a beginner, it's a bit arrogant and presumptuous to think I can go so far... And am I going too fast? Should I focus on my basics and go at it slow and steady instead? I feel like if I take part and screw up then I might ""burn out"" my love for the sport which is stupid also...

2) Although I want to grab this chance, I also want to study properly also. If I neglect my studies, then it's also like I'm running away from my duty as a student to do my work properly because it's a stake in my own future. I understand that it's only 1 exams period, but like if I bochup my studies here then I might do it again down the road then yada yada yada I will end up being a half-hearted human who just keeps running away from something that I'm not good at also... Then there's the factor that I'm not paying for my education so I'm wasting other people's money also...

3) If I take part, I will definitely get hurt because it's pretty rough. It would get in the way of my studying and my normal life also for a few weeks, I expect. So... it's kind of foolish to just try because it's not really ""nothing to lose"" also...

Actually as I type this I know I'm leaning towards not taking part but I just wanted to rant and hear some things back from you guys... :D"

833,60985,"Hello, this may sound very preachy. 

But I just wanted to share my favourite quote from Louis CK - one of the funniest stand-up comics in US (but is now embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal). Regardless, that doesn't undermine the validity of this meaningful quote by him: 


""The only time you should look in your neighbor's bowl is to make sure that they have enough. You don't look in your neighbor's bowl to see if you have as much as them.""


I easily get resentful about the life I'm living especially since the university is filled with many privileged people. This quote keeps me grounded, prompts me to check my own privileges and prevents me from becoming overwhelmed by envy and jealousy. It's bloody hard not to covet after the glamorous things in life, but I think I'm beginning to understand that many material goods really aren't as attractive as they seem. 


(Conspicuous) consumption is in reality, over-rated, and many times, if we can see pass strategic advertisements (people actually take courses on how to make ads successful!), social media self-aggrandizing, and the inherent biasedness and partiality of the wonderful images that surrounds us, we might realise that an exotic holiday to Maldives, the branded LV bag, the Adidas Stan Smith shoes collection or the latest iPhone isn't really that big of a deal. My no-brand shoes actually feel very comfortable. I haven't changed my no-brand haversack for five years now and its still working very well, dutifully carrying all my heavy books and laptop. I heard my friends' Nike bag tore within a year (she changed to another Nike one). 


I have never been to anywhere apart from Singapore and Malaysia and sometimes i feel like I'm not worldly enough but also what's the point of going to romantic churches in Europe when you don't even know the significance of these historical sites and you're only using the architectural design as the backdrop of your vain instagram pic. I'll go to places that I find meaningful. Not just what travel agencies shove into my face and down my throat.


I can't help but feel that we yearn for these luxury items for the very superficial and shallow reason of making ourselves feel good, especially when we post our hauls and purchases online. We elevate our esteems through eliciting envy from others and i think that is harmful to all of us. We seek validation from being conforming to the glamourous norms we see around us. 


Maybe it's time we start to have our own opinions on how to live a life that we find meaningful?"

I do not agree with #60959's advice. There must be a legit reason why #60927 really thinks that their relationship will not work. Tbh if there are indeed legit reasons to doubt if the relationship could work in the first place, why risk it and risk a heartbreak ? 

If all you want is just being part of their life, it is still 100% possible to achieve that while maintaining platonic relationship. Romantic relationship is not always the ultimate goal of relationships. If all you needed is companionship/emotional attachment from them, it is fine to keep it platonic. For all I know the latter may die out sooner than you thought. But if indeed at the end something really grew out of it then by all means. It's definitely okay to give some thoughts to this. Romantic relationship based on impulses is really childish and will not work out in the long term."

In fact, many of those are designed to soluble in water. This defeats the purpose of being a ""plastic replacement"" since the job that plastic does so well (waterproofing), the replacement materials are next to useless at it.

848,60967,"While we're complaining about NUS IT I gotta vent about the engineering website. Seriously, the new website is much worse than the old one. If you go to the top bar, a menu-bar pops up but 4/6 categories are completely empty of sub-entries? It's like someone just threw their hands up and submitted incomplete work at the deadline. You have to go to their individual pages for each programme (e.g. IDP) and click through another 3-5 pages before getting to actually relevant information such as module descriptions. And I'm not a fan of the new-age style web design which is endless amounts of white space, text that takes up only 10% of the screen and forces you to scroll forever, and 1440p ultra-high-res pictures of handsome/pretty smiling students, which is of absolutely zero use. Oh, and large numbers of pages still have not been migrated over from the inaccessible old website, despite it being months since the change (tip to the poor guy trying to find out if he's on deans list, you're probably not).

For those curious, the current computing website is about what the old engineering website was like, and the current science website is slowly morphing into an engineering-like one (somebody please stop them). Frankly the new website is less useful and the change was not needed, and I strongly suspect some kickbacks were passed around to make it happen at all."

And if you go work, you’d be trapped in a small cubicle all day with nary a chance to travel overseas. What kind of jobs provide good travelling overseas opportunities? 

I never went for any grad trip at the end of JC. Plus now I never went overseas on Any immersion programmes, what should I do now? 

Is there anything I can do to make up for the lost overseas opportunities I previously missed out on? 

 i never tried Starbucks/ jewel coffee/coffee Smith. I only tried kopi Beng and Nescafe COs they are cheap. I never ate at restaurants before. I don’t mean Michelin Star ones, I mean ALL restaurants I also never try before. I only can eat Hawker and food court food. Maybe macdonalds, subway, kfc I can eat, but the higher tier one should I really never eat before.

853,60959,"Reply to #60959 and #60927.
I do not agree with #60959's advice. There must be a legit reason why #60927 really thinks that their relationship will not work. Tbh if there are indeed legit reasons to doubt if the relationship could work in the first place, why risk it and risk a heartbreak ? 

If all you want is just being part of their life, it is still 100% possible to achieve that while maintaining platonic relationship. Romantic relationship is not always the ultimate goal of relationships. If all you needed is companionship/emotional attachment from them, it is fine to keep it platonic. For all I know the latter may die out sooner than you thought. But if indeed at the end something really grew out of it then by all means. It's definitely okay to give some thoughts to this. Romantic relationship based on impulses is really childish and will not work out in the long term."
854,60956,"Contrary to opinions expressed here, I've generally had a great time in CS2030. I enjoyed doing all of the assignments; the lecturers and lecture slides are crystal-clear, and Prof Henry's management of the module (despite the ballooning cohort size) is effective. 

He and Prof Zhao have set clear deadlines, answered questions on forums promptly and directly. 

I was having some difficulty with a particular lab, when all of a sudden at 11 pm, Prof Henry announced that he'd be extending the deadline due to popular demand. He had already extended deadlines for several previous labs. He even offered an alternative for students who couldn't complete a certain lab that was floated before recess week.

This motivated me to work harder on the lab, and I finished it at 12.06, six minutes after the original deadline. Despite not being amongst the students who asked for a time extension, I still felt relieved that I was able to complete it, because I was ready to tank the marks for that lab. 

Needless to say the module has been very smooth sailing and marking has been completely automated, quick and responsive. Any bugs have also been fixed promptly after feedback was given. Compared to the borderline fiasco that was a certain other introductory module last semester, CS2030 has been calm waters and smooth sailing all around.

Many of my fellow CS peers have also been of great help, and the TAs go to length to ensure students understand content. 

Thanks, everyone. "

861,60940,"I am currently working part-time in a retail job in a sales position while studying in uni full-time. 

It pays slightly better (basic $10/hr) than the market rate given by most other retail or FnB jobs around ($7-$9). Additionally it has commissions for products that we sell and a few other small little monetary benefits here and there which probably rounds up the pay to be about $12/hr.

Now, I know I should feel contented with the pay, but I feel out of place. This is because most of the other part-time colleagues working with me are studying in poly/ITE while working part-time. Most of them are younger than me. I rarely see other uni undergraduates working in the same company as me. I feel as if I'm doing something wrong, like there is something other uni undergraduates are currently doing which I'm not, and I'm afraid of missing out on that and not making full use of my time in uni.

My family situation is middle-class, my parents can afford to pay for my uni fees as well other miscellaneous stuff, and I'm not pressured to pay bills or take bank loans or anything like that. The main reason why I've been working part-time jobs is because I like the extra money that comes in and I can build up my savings (I've already hit 5 digits), albeit at a pretty slow pace since most part-time jobs don't pay that well. I'm wondering if there are better things I should be doing rather than working in part-time retail jobs(which I feel isn't very relevant to what I'm studying, I'm studying a degree that prepares me for white-collar professional jobs in the future but I'm doing blue-collar work right now)

Hence I am looking for advice on what uni undergraduates do in their free-time aside from working in part-time retail jobs?

P.S I tried applying for internships related to what I want to do in the future (high finance, banks) but I haven't received any emails back yet. I know that those companies are extremely competitive to get into so I may be looking at continuing to work in retail jobs if I don't get any offers. :(

875,60921,"Purely curious and would like to collect some opinions from the guys (or girls). So i was sharing my views (with my parents juz now) with rgds to mate selection criteria, then they said something along the line that - looks are more impt than wealth esp for girls, so even if a woman is poor and lowly educated, as long as 'she' is pretty and kind-heart, most men wouldn't mind. They also 'corrected' me and say that woman are not obliged to contribute as much financially to the household as men do. With rgds to buying a house, they also feel that men should have generosity to pay 60% or more.

Other than this, they also advice my brother to find a rich woman so hopefully she can take the financial lead in the household.

---(I know that the abv two statements are contracting) 

My thoughts...firstly...is it true that guys prioritize looks more than wealth when seeking for a partner? I mean if a guy is rich, i am sure his family would want him to find 门当户对. Isn't it more logical for someone (regardless of man or woman) in today's century to have a tendency to choose wealth compared to just looks??? When i read nusw, i also note that some commented in a more A-A way and feels that man and woman should share equal financial burdens. So is my parent's thinking wrong? 

Secondly, would a lonely single rich woman really don't mind taking the financial lead for a poor but e.g. handsome man. If that is the case, wouldn't remain single a better choice? (at least you still have the freedom)

So if it was you in such situations, choose looks or wealth?, or rather remain single???

879,60913,"As someone with decent grades graduating coming May. Here is a piece of job searching advice to maximise your search. I've had the luck of securing a number of well-paid jobs and this is my experience.

1. Enquire about the interview process, skip out anything more than 3 rounds of interviews (formal + informal). They are simply not worth your time and speaking to clueless HR departments is an absolute waste of resources, effort and time.

2. Apply across a different range of companies. Fortune 500 to SMEs, a lot of times SMEs pays competitive salaries and they hire people they actually need and not another cog in the system. F500 places typically have a structured environment across diff functions to grow in. Great for people still trying to find out which part of the work you want to specialise in.

3. Always. Always. Always thank your interviewers be it via a short text or email. Show appreciation for their time.

4. Always always negotiate your salary once you've got the offer. HR department typically has a tough time telling their direct hiring managers that an applicant they accepted declined their offer. You have the upper arm here. Of course, be realistic and don't ask for a doubled salary, find out the market rate and adjust according to the actual skill set you have to offer.

5. If a competing company in a similar environment offers you a higher salary, but you wish to work for another one. Bring up the issue of salaries and let them know you hope they would be able to match their offer. Companies typically want to hire people in higher demand (basic logic), especially so when the competing company happens to be a reputable one (you have the obligation to not divulge any names, they would be unprofessional to ask you)

884,60907,"Hi again, I'm the OP of #60907 (FANG data point). I posted my comp data with the best intentions, but somehow, they were misconstrued into something totally inaccurate. I find myself trying to slay the Hydra, where more heads appear as I cut them off. So let me share more details to shed more light:

My salary figures are not exceptionally high. If you can't ask your friends for these figures, you can always check out levels.fyi. They crowdsourced starting salary figures for each company and each level (including indeed). My salary is definitely within those band for the corresponding levels. Maybe on the lower side for the levels where I was promoted.

The taxes I quoted are accurate, and do include Social Security Tax (6.2%), Medicare Tax (1.45%), and Medicare Surtax (0.9%). It's easy to question how is it that I have such a ""low"" effective tax rate. The answer lies in the word ""effective"". While everyone's tax situation is different in the US, there are a few standard ways in calculating and reducing your tax liability:
- Taxable income is quite different from gross income. It is subjected to deductions. The basic deduction is just to take the standard deduction of 12.2k (pegged to inflation). So, my taxable income is reduced to 317k - 12.2k = 314.8k
- I maxed out my Traditional 401k contribution of of 19k. 401k is the US equivalent of CPF, but voluntary. Income that I divert to my 401k account is tax deferred. That means I reduce my taxable income this year by 19k, and any withdrawals at retirement are treated as income. I won't go into details of 401k, but at retirement, your income is so low that the tax rate for your 401k withdrawal is also around the 10-12% range in the future. So, now my taxable income is 286k
- Social security tax is only applied to your first 132.9k of your income. The limit is pegged roughly to inflation, so in 2016, it is applied to your first 118.5k of your income. This also means that for 2019 I'm going to pay 8.2k in Social Security Taxes (or 2.6% of my expected income of 317k).
- Medicare tax is 1.45% applied to all gross income (4.6k for 2019)
- Medicare Surtax is applied to taxable income above 200k. For 2019, I expect to pay $774
- Federal taxes are progressive. This means that you pay 10% on your first 10k of taxable income, 12% on your next 20k, and so on. Even though I'm in the 35% tax bracket, my effective federal tax, after all deductions, is 75k (or 24% of Gross)
- Adding all taxes together I get 89k, or 28% of Gross.

Sales tax is ~10%. No question that this is higher than in Singapore. However, groceries are not taxed, and I don't spend much in general. Fun fact: I buy a year's supply of shaving kit whenever I'm back in Singapore as you have no idea how expensive those razors are.

Jordan Dea-Mattson's calculation of 50-60% taxes is just plain wrong. Perhaps his back-of-napkin calculation used marginal tax rate, and unlimited SST + medicare surtax + no 401k contribution. If there something big I'm missing here, please let me know because I'll need to file a correction on my tax returns before I get deported.

Point is, I'm just another guy offering another data point. Most of data here (taxes, rent, salary bands) can be verified on the Internet. You just need to put in the effort to actually do those calculations.

PS: I could do an AMA over NUSWhispers to answer any other questions about my comp if there is enough interest. When there is sufficient responses, I'll try to answer as long as I can anonymize my identity and company."
885,60906,"Hi OP of #60906, 

Like you, I'm from year 3 CS currently who doesn't really like my course.  I didn't choose CS for money as it isn't the in-thing at my application time then. I choose it for stable employment-sake. 

I think I'm still ""sane"" (Having at least 8 hours of sleep everyday and a CCA, average CAP with average intellect) by your definition, so I seem fit to give advice in handling overwhelming stress.  I can't say how to improve grades or become better in the course as I'm just average, so I will give different kind of advice to cope stress.

In the midst of your messy life, do you know what you like to do? Both as interest and as a career? I hated software engineering, but I do like to code for analytics and using Excel VBA, so I'm looking for a more numerical analyst kind of job in the future as I do like math (numbers-kind). And I'm better at talking (talk big lol) so it seems more fitting me to do a more analyst kind of job than being a software engineer which is more technical oriented.

Find some peace in your interests. I know what I like outside of CS or math, which I find myself peace in doing these activities. Yes it does hurt my CAP but I believe that my health/sanity is more important than my CAP.

However, I couldn’t make up my mind whether to accept the job offer by that hiring startup because I think there could be better job opportunities out there and then I could compare and decide on which is the best job for myself. So initially I emailed the hiring manager that I could not accept the job offer first and will let him know my decision by next week. However the next day, he replied that he has already hired another person who accepted the job offer instantly when he/she came for interview on the day itself and as such the position is no longer available. In other words, I was kicked out and now I am left with no job offer since this is the only job I have been offered despite going to multiple interviews.  

How can I face my boss now? The date for my last day of work is still pending. Should I stay on until June and throughout these few months, I continue to take leave to attend interviews?But isnt it obvious to my boss that the reason for taking leaves from work is because I am going to interviews which means I will be potentially poached by other companies?Please advice me the best course of action. 

Also since I have lost contact doing programming work for the past 3 years, the employers told me I will have to expect a pay cut since my IT knowledge level is not up to par and will probably be the same as fresh  poly graduate despite having 3 years of working experience which is not related to IT. Which websites do you think is good that allow me to pick up programming language fast so that I can acquire the relevant skills that employers in the IT field is seeking for?  "
887,60904,"#60904 I've heard similiar stories about how the QET test is not actually marked legit. I myself am still fuming mad I got a Band 2 despite writing what I thought was well thought out and analytical paper. I had even memorised a whole bunch of 'cheem' words just for that paper.

Some say the examiners just mark the first few papers in an entire row then grade the entire row based on the first few students' papers they had marked. Surely it's gotta be raise a huge all-out controversy and investigation if this turned out to be true? That the QET is just one big masquerade of a joke?
I dont know how true or false such rumours are...but really, this is crazy if it turns out true."

889,60902,"I just did the craziest thing. I changed my LinkedIn profile and lied that I had my dream position at my dream company. I even uploaded a fake letter of offer on my social media and treated my family with dinner to celebrate successfully a job.

Every morning, I travel to my temporary job while wearing formal wear only to change to more casual wear once I have reached the workplace in order to keep up with the act.

It may seem tedious, but it feels good waking up in the morning lying to myself that I have found a permanent job.

Whenever I see my friends struggling to  find jobs, I even offer job interview tips and tell them ""how I succeeded in passing an interview"".

If someone from my dream company sees my fake LinkedIn profile and demand that I remove it, I will tell them to hire me instead so that it won't be a fake profile.

If you think that whatever I am doing seem meaningless, you have to consider how it feels to be unemployed.

890,60898,"After seeing so many posts on people talking about their ex, I think I should share about mine too. It started in 2016. When no one was there for me, she was always there for me. Even though at times I would prefer some personal space when I am feeling down, she will constantly stay by my side. This meant so much to me as I could always turn to someone, hug her and lie on her shoulders any time I wanted to. After a few weeks into our relationship, I asked her if she wanted to do it. She asked me if I was fine with it even if she was already banged by many other people in the past. Honestly, I was quite shocked by her reply because I did not expect her to be this type of person. However, I know that I still love her a lot because after thinking about it a while, I actually didn't mind the fact that she was banged by other people before. Our relationship got better and better each time I banged her. However, after two years, I felt that the relationship needed to come to an end as I will hardly see her due to school.

Not in a metaphorical sense like some people that seem to have an active social life yet never truly open up to anyone BUT really almost literally as I have 0 social life.

I have a desire for an active social life yet society feels alien to me, there’s an instinctive nature in me that makes me dislike being with humans in general. Maybe because I have trust issues and low self esteem since young?

It is as if I am autistically anti-social yet not truly under that definition. It’s like I had a weird mental disease that less than 0.000001% of the population in this country have. It’s like I am truly alone, like a living ghost. I only wish I could be reborn with a different mentality to enjoy life as I see all around me.

Not that I don't want children, but I don't wished to be addressed as ""mummy"", ""mum"". Like I have a name and I would like to be called as such; the same way when my cousin's children call me by name. 

Essentially, I intend to hold that ""mother"" name by the virtue of giving birth to my kid, but not as a 'role' to my child. I would like to take the role like an older friend to my kid(s); have them call me by my name and stuff. I would prefer a more egalitarian position in relation to my kid.

905,60867,"Suggestion 

Dear sir/mdm,

I would like to suggest regarding on making all the part time students have their courses to be conduct in mainly theory and heavily e-learning based. As they are too busy with work and having enough hands on at work. You all can also make every year of the bachelor courses to be year 1 all about theory, year 2 to be all practical and year 3 all about attachment with 6 months in public/school jobs and another 6 months in private sector for full time students. This way, this will shorten what to be taught but at the same time maximize what they should learn in the school.

906,60865,"Let me rant a little. Pardon my English and lack of punctuation

Soooo 3 months ago, my boyfriend of 5 years told me that he was also dating another friend of mine without me knowing and that he wanted a polygamy. That friend of mine told me that she knew he was dating me but she thought that I knew he was dating her too. I told him that I could not accept being in a polygamy. Broke up with him and broke the friendship with her in December.

Met him last week to pass his stuff back to him (I used to help him fix his electronics but he never got them back from me since he often came to my house to play with them anyway). He said he broke up with that friend, and wants me back. I still have feelings for him, but couldn't forgive him, so I rejected him.

After apologising and begging me to go back to him for about an hour, he asked ""I spent so much effort to try to win you back, spent so much money in the past few months trying buy things for you, I lost everything just to get you back, are you telling me that it's all for nothing?""

I never asked for it. I never asked you to buy me anything. When we broke up, you said you felt bad that it's always me who bought you gifts during anniversaries and special events the past 5 years, saying that you were very thankful that I always offer to pay for the meals or allow us to pay for our own meals, yet during the past few months when we never contacted each other much, you're telling me that you've put in a lot of effort and money to win me back? I'm not sure how I should have reacted. I just ran off crying without paying for the bill this time.

More than heartbroken, I felt more disappointment. Disappointed in myself for having feelings for him even after all these farce, disappointed that my friend never told me about their relationship when I always gushed to her about the things that happen between him and I, disappointed in him as a whole.
He's still texting me, yet I can't bear to block him out of my life. I want to move on, yet I still miss him. I can't forgive my friend, yet I wish to have her back in my life.

It's during times like these that I wish I had a social life and had someone to talk to about it instead of ranting this here"

Except that climate change isnt just warm weather and dying turtles. You want to know about world hunger? Ok. Increased extreme weather events due to climate change, are devastating farms and causing droughts, putting world hunger on the rise again for the first time in decades. Rising sea levels are destroying low-lying islands and putting the poor farmers out of work. Millions are starving, but millions and millions will starve as global warming worsens. 

Of course, world hunger and poverty isn't just caused by climate change. And there are issues besides climate change. War, hunger, -isms, corruption.

910,60859,"There are so many ppl that aren't empathetic enough to understand that each of us experiences the world and life differently. We break up and feel sad. We get bad grades and feel discouraged. Yet there are some ppl that brush these emotions aside and lament the fact that feeling upset is of no use and even going to the extent of chastising these parties for having such emotions. 

Yo. Not everyone can be like you. So superior and omnipotent. So great and ""godly"". Understand that each of us have different life and past experiences that made us who we are today. You may have a difficult childhood that made you so strong and difficult to break, which may be one of the many factors that made you think that crying and feeling demoralised are for the weak. So what? Not everyone needs to be like you. If you think that way, then we should have clones of you instead of a diversity of different ppl with different personalities. That would be scary.

Understand that each of us may have gone through things that are worst than what you have gone through. Sure you became stronger, through what means we don't know. Positive thinking, grit and determination? Maybe. Some of us just don't have the luxury of this. We might have wanted to become like you, but certain things impede our development and attempts at a better self. Another traumatic event? Another fruitless attempt despite multiple tries? You don't know. 

Understand that each of us are special. Some of us are strong, some of us need the encouragement of others to become strong. Accepting this very fact can make the world a better place. Empathy is key. And if you are thinking empathy is cheap or impossible, then you are not adapting. You are not changing. Why should you change for others? Cos changes can be specific. Changes can be varied. You are not being asked to change your entire view of life. Changes can be for the better. You can change without altering your own beliefs. Compassionate and hard headed. I don't see why not.

If you are still thinking like there isn't a need to change, then you are not adapting. You are not growing. You are staying stagnant, and maybe becoming an impediment yourself. "

....
....
I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen. Idk if all break ups are like this, but this seems unnecessarily painful. Maybe you should have waited until I am less emotional. Maybe do it during our good timesml. Dont let go babe....""

To those people in the comment section who are calling him too needy, being too clingy etc, all of y'all ought to reflect on yourselves. Read the last paragraph. ""I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen"". And all you guys did was to bash him for being too needy, and even accuse him of being the toxic one in the relationship?? As a society, we have failed. As a NUS community, we lack basic empathy. We have a depressed young man who just broke up, and seriously all that is said to him was that he was the problem in the relationship? I just hope that none of your friends will ever come to y'all for advice next time, because I am absolutely disgusted and outraged by your lack of basic human empathy.

Sure, you may blame him for coming to such a platform to pour his heart out, and even say that he ""had it coming to him"". But coming here just highlights his desperation and vulnerability, and need for comfort at such a difficult time. All he needed were encouraging statements, perhaps ""learn from what went wrong, be it you or him, and move on"" could be all he needed to hear at this point in time. I really hope you guys are ashamed of yourselves, for kicking someone when he is down, for ignoring someone's cry for help, for literally causing more harm than good just because you wanted to look good and score brownie points on the internet."

930,60826,"Frankly, I can't stand people who say ""it should be entirely a choice to go green, there shouldnt be green policies or legislation"". Yes, the straws are not tackling the real issue, but even if we introduce effective policies, people will still keep wailing ""I want my choices, you're inconveniencing me!"". 

""Going green should come from the heart"", ""you must rely only on people changing their mindsets, not making rules"". Yeah those are nice but naive statements. What makes you think people will be so willing to go green out of nowhere, if they are already this butthurt about straws? Do you really think that simply encouraging people, instead of making rules, is effective? Do you know how long it takes to make that kind of soft cultural change? If you make rules now, people will learn to adapt and change their culture much faster. If you have seen any news about climate change recently, you will realize how urgent things are. 

Without green policy, most people won't voluntarily go green from the pure goodness of their heart. 

Especially in singapore, where apparently, it might be unliveable by 2070, but people here are still writing strangely sexual rants railing against green policy. Yes, straws arent the real issue, but if we ban wider plastic use, we will still see some of these people crying about their freedom to pollute. For them, I wonder if they want to be literally dying of heatstroke in 2070 while saying ""at least I can get my soda in a plastic cup""

Anti-straw is a mostly useless diversion, but green policies are still needed. Policies, and not encouragement. Shoved up your butt figuratively? Yes. We have no time. Hell, even encouragement instead of rules has people saying ""you're rubbing it in my face!"". Then yes, we are.

932,60816,"The real issue isn't necessarily about straws or no straws. May I propose an alternative? That we should be waging our environmental crusade against using disposables for dining in. In comparison to straws, that doesn't add convenience, destroys the environment unnecessarily, and is a cost saving method to companies. Instead, of straws which in comparison to all the starbucks takeaway-cups and disposable plates, comprise much less environmental harm AND actually give us convenience. Banning straws makes life that bit more annoying for everyone, and cuts costs for companies who may not even re-invest that extra savings into saving the environment. Let's be smart about it.

944,60795,"To #60735, this is my response to your post. Your original post is in quotation marks.

“I recently broke up with my girlfriend. I took it really hard cuz she has been thinking for it for awhile yet she has never told me.”

It appears that her attraction for you have been falling for quite some time. As a guy, one of your roles in a relationship is to look out for her attraction level, even if you are married. Once it starts to fall, you should take action to bring it back up. If you are unsure of her attraction level, it is better to assume a lower one, before it becomes too late. 

“It exploded on me when I am most vulnerable.”

If her attraction level had been falling for some time, and you have been more attentive to her, it should not come as a surprise for you.

“We talked, on one hand I know it's beyond hopeless to get her back. She told me I am just too emotional to not be able to see that our relationship is toxic.” 

She had been trying to tell you about how she thinks the relationship is not working, i.e. her attraction level for you is falling, but it seems that you were not listening to her. Communication is two-way, you need to listen. Only when you start to listen, then you can know how to fix the problems in the relationship.

“As I look back, I really disagree. We had our overwhelmingly good times. She just could not see it. You were the one who told me all couples had fights. You give up way too soon. 3 years packed with memory going down the drain.”

You are ignoring the present, and living in past memories.

“Oh how I wish I knew about this. You don't know how much I am willing to change for you. For all the happiness that you have ever brought me. I can say for sure you are well worth it. Another chance at love please..” 

Are you begging her to give this relationship another chance, after you broke up with her? Girls do not want a guy to beg her into doing anything; they want a strong guy who knows what he is doing and is not wishy-washy. Move on, plenty of fish out there.

“I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen. Idk if all break ups are like this, but this seems unnecessarily painful. Maybe you should have waited until I am less emotional. Maybe do it during our good timesml. Dont let go babe....” 

You are thinking that she is the only one for you, as if your world revolves around her, and ignoring all the other options. Move on.

I posted #60611, and from the comments I think a lot of people have misinterpreted my reason for posting it. I was not looking for reassurance of my abilities. I was trying to find out if sexism and gender discrimination is a problem that many girls like myself face, or that I'm just unlucky. At the same time, I wanted to raise awareness of implicit gender bias. A lot of us think that we are not sexist. However, because we grew up in an environment where gender stereotypes were ""imprinted"" onto us, sometimes we subconsciously are. Now that we are aware that we might be unintentionally biased, we can make a conscious effort to correct/unlearn it. 

You are not good with kids ""for a guy"", just because traditionally women are the caretakers. You are good with kids, period. You are not a good engineer (or programmer, or mathematician, or scientist, etc) ""for a girl"". You are good regardless of your gender. Stereotypes are unhealthy for everyone. 

Lastly, to the girls in male-dominated fields who feel like you don't belong, feel like you're less competent, less qualified, or just /less/, I want to tell you that you are not. You earned your spot to be there, and you deserve to be there as much as everyone around you does. Don't let anyone tell you that you are only valued just because you are a girl (in a sea of guys), and don't let anyone judge you based on that. 

Thank you all once again for your time, and I hope we can work towards a more equitable society. "
980,60717,"Exchange student here, been reading complains about CS2030. I have 2 suggestions, practices currently done in my college, that perhaps the course coordinators can consider: 
1. Fixed weekly consultation slots held by student teachers. I understand that in NUS student teachers are paid per hour and not paid an incentive if they conduct consultations outside of formal lesson timeslots? If so, I would suggest that weekly consult times be made 'formal' and these student teachers be paid accordingly. With the number of student teachers in this mod, maybe 30mins-1hr per student teacher should cover the entire week, allowing students some guidance over asking google. It is only fair to expect student teachers to be unwilling to take questions outside of lesson time if they are not compensated for it. However, at current, consultations with the prof seems to be a challenge as well.
2. Releasing of answers immediately after submission of assignments. Not sure what the teaching methodology is here, but back home, coding is taught through lots and practice, feedback and reading other people's codes. I suppose providing insightful feedback on our code comes at a cost giving the cohort size, but providing the solutions to our weekly assignments comes at almost no cost. I m sure students will benefit if they could have some form of reference instead of coding blindly every lab not knowing how they can do better."

Free 4MCs? I would willingly have the school take away 4MCs away from the current credits I have completed just for a chance to join Orbital. And no, it is also not because I wish I could skip NOC interviews. 

Coming from a non-soc faculty, it is really difficult for someone like me to meet and learn from SOC students. It doesn't help that so many of my non-soc friends have literally given up on CS after / while taking CS1010. So to me, it's an incredible opportunity to network, gain experience, get feedback, and work with SOC students. I would definitely even consider crashing the seminars if I could actually get information on where they are held and at what time. So yes, there are still people out there who want to join orbital for the right reasons, not just for the free 4MCs as you suggested. 

I could probably (and am going to have to) learn everything by myself, but the way I see it, orbital is NOT overrated; its true value lies in allowing peers to come together to work on a project and learn from each other. But as you said, ""there is no room to blame the organizing committee"" and ""grow up"", and I completely agree. Just gotta go a different route and work on my own projects, on my own during the summer. 

Really hope the organizing committee considers increasing the quota for non-soc students in the future, so that students from other faculties will get the chance to work with soc students more.

Imagine a hot knife being slowly driven down your back with a good ol twist at the end. So I wanted to know what really happened and what I did wrong but all I got were inconsistent stories where I found out she was actually omitting and twisting the facts. 

I even found out after that that she was lying to me all along about her previous infidelity and that she had actually cheated on her ex too, which honestly would have changed my mind about getting together with her in the first place. Looking back, I still remember the way she used to tell me about how she ""valued"" honesty and transparency, as if to distract me or divert my suspicions away from her. 

I finally left her but with all the lies I've been fed, I really don't know what to believe anymore. She loves to flirt with other guys (even when I'm physically standing next to her) and I wouldn't be surprised if there were more third parties involved. 

Tbh I had a strong feeling something was wrong from the beginning(and throughout) and I beat myself all the time for not acting on my suspicions and leaving her earlier.

Economics is the one I was initially leaning towards the most, as I developed great interest in it ever since picking it up in JC. The concepts, theories, and general essay writing were all relatively easy for me to grasp and I was able to consistently do well in JC. However, I have read about how Economics in Uni places much more emphasis on the mathematical / statistics aspect of things, which worries me as Math has always been one of my weakest subjects since young. 

With regards to Psychology, I've also found out that many people blindly dive into pursuing this major without truly understanding what it entails. Yet, my current impression of Psychology still places it as one of the top few majors that I have interest in. Many also claim that a Psychology degree on its own is useless, as Psychology is a case of ""Do the Masters, or don't do it at all'. Could anyone kindly explain this statement?

I am still in the process of finding out more information about CNM and Geography, so any advice or feedback from both current and graduated students are welcome and will be appreciated!

An individual will naturally have bias for or against a particular issue due to one’s upbringing and socialisation, which starts the moment you’re born. What’s important I feel is to analyse both sides of the argument. It is supposed to challenge your ""common sense"".

Perhaps these claims you mentioned are more of these individuals speaking from lived experiences? They play a part in forming one’s perceptions. It could also be stereotypes or dominant discourse. It may not necessarily be the ""truth"" but the fact that they exist must reflect the situation in a particular segment of society. But then again, there's no such thing as a definite ""truth"" or ""reality"". Of course proper research would have to be done if you’re writing a research paper but when you’re doing in-class discussions and seminars, I would think lived experiences are the more readily accessible area of knowledge.

Higher barriers to entry? Perhaps it is the pessimist/conspiracy theorist in me but that’s highly unlikely. As mentioned by another, FASS in general dabbles in issues that can be subversive. Making the entry barriers higher may send the message that it is a desirable course. More people will want to pursue it and more may even end up starting to question the establishment. Probably not what any state would want. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s one of the reason why the arts and humanities are not provided funding as high as those of STEM.

1004,60676,"OP of #46692 here. For those who are lazy to click, here's what I posted last time:

""Had a secondary school gathering the other day met the girl who was my first love. After the gathering we shared a cab home since we live around the same area. 

The short 20 min ride was an emotional rollercoaster (no pun intended) for me. It reminded me of the reason why I was completely attracted to her back then. At the same time it reminded me of why we didn't, and would never have worked out.

We're still on talking terms and in fact is planning for a trip for this group of secondary school friends at the end of the year. But I guess that bittersweet feeling I get when I'm around her would never go away. ""

During the trip, there was this moment when two of us were alone. Somehow the conversation topic came to our past relationship, how we got together, how we broke up etc. It was then I asked : 

""Would we have worked out if both of us were more mature?""

She didn't reply at the moment. And I decided not to pursue the topic.

At the end of the trip we shared a cab home from the airport again since we live in the same area. We didn't talk much during the ride. Just when she's about to alight she said: 

""I guess we'll never know unless we try.""

Fast forward a couple of months to today: We are happily attached and the appears to be going strong.  Idk how far we'll go this time. I'm just grateful that we're given a second chance. I'll treasure this and hopefully take her down the aisle this time. 

For all those troubled by love out there: Not everyone will get a second chance like us. If you really love your other half, treasure them. "

1006,60673,"Hi guys I need some advice.

I have recently graduated last year (overloaded to grad 1 sem early), with a second upper in comms, and now am working with a friend on a startup earning about 2K a month. I know it's very little considering what I can earn outside doing a 9-5 desk job, but I am passionate about the business, and don't mind the long working hours hustling to grow it.

I'm in a dilemma right now, and am very very stressed out because of the pressure from my parents who are expecting me to earn 3K+ and collecting CPF with my degree. As the company is still very small, it is unable to pay me what outside companies can offer, but should it grow, I know I will definitely be the first to be given my dues, considering I'm part of the founding team (aka as the company earns more, I will get paid more).

The dilemma is then, should I take the conventional, safe route of graduating > getting a comfortable 9-5 job which I might not enjoy as much as what I'm doing now, OR should I chase my dreams and take the high risk/high reward, unconventional route of entrepreneurship and continue grinding at the company?

As with most entrepreneurial journeys/startups, success is not certain and I'm aware of that, hence r'now I'm in a limbo of whether it is worth it to take the leap of faith and try to see if it works out, or just go and start finding a job pronto and not waste anymore time.

1007,60671,"#60610 here

Hey Prof Ben, sorry if it came across that way but I didn't mean to say you were elitist and I probably should have phrased it differently. Didn't mean to be rude or anything. I think it's that you remind us regularly that the job market as of today is still quite elitist in nature (at least for first jobs) and the motivations behind it, when many profs in my course (I'm not in CS but in a fluffier subject) like to downplay its importance which is a real source of frustration. This is especially ironic when they always say they will use the bell curve. It's always the essays which I've struggled with scoring, the mods where it's a set answer I've done much better. You know I wish my profs would release the solutions so I knew where I went wrong, but that hasn't happened.

Again, I hope you understand from the post that I actually agree with the fact that you say what needs to be said and treat us like young adults instead of kids which need coddling. University should be a time where students grow up, maybe you could say grades are not the only thing and there are other things which matter true, but downplaying it's importance just to make students feel better doesn't fix anything. Going to a consult only to hear that the score doesn't suck doesn't fix anything. A spade is a spade. When you ask, what you want to know is what you missed and what was expected which led to your score so that you don't suck the next time, that's way more important.

I didn't expect such a long response tbh, but I've read it and this sincere piece of advice, I'll take it. I generally agree with most of what you said, but I do have this to say, I think everyone compares upwards generally because that's where we want to end up to be answerable to ourselves and our loved ones. Knowing yourself to be fortunate is one thing, but using that as an excuse to lose one's drive and cave into self-consolation gets us nowhere. There are many kids who want to get into uni but don't on their first try, but they don't just take that no for an answer. They strive and work hard in what they do, eager to prove themselves, some of them coming in as mature candidates while others work their way up into their careers to prove that they've got what it takes to succeed. That's what we should be inspiring, instead of saying because you're in nus you're exceptional because you're the best. Frankly, this sort of behaviour not only reinforces societal stereotypes against non-uni kids, but can make those in uni develop complacency and a sense of entitlement. 

Lastly, I think your idea of pushing for mastery over a one time test is really ambitious, and even though I may not directly benefit from this change since I'm not in CS, I wish you and your team all the best in getting these tough but necessary reforms passed and hope it catches on across the entire university. It's exciting to have such a deep exchange of views, and I hope there aren't any hard feelings and I sincerely apologise if there was anything I said that was personally offensive in any way, but I'll be blunt this talk about 'exceptional because you're here' needs to stop."

Anyway, if the algorithm isn't already implementing this, I suggest that a new system could take in the timetable of all the students and generate the number of specific bus route needed for each timing. For example, If there are many students with lecture transiting from FOS to CLB at 12 pm, perhaps, the system could send more bus that caters to these students plus minus 30 minutes such as sending more bus A1 (I don't know if its the right bus) from 11.30 am to 12.30 pm. I think that the routes are quite simple within NUS and therefore, I don't think that it is an unreasonable request for the bus drivers to be familiarized with all the routes and to change multiple routes throughout the day. They just have to follow a platform that tells them which route to drive at which timing etc. 

If the current system is already taking this into account then just take it that I am talking nonsense. I'm just a lazy student and don't really feel like digging out the current system of the buses.

Call me pampered if you like but the former generally results in some drink getting on the outside of the cup while the latter just adds a weird off-putting cardboard taste in your drink. Given such ""strong"" support from NUS to remove these straws I suggest bring them back and see how much usage has actually dropped from these forced measures. All this is doing is pissing off and converting previously neutral consumers. NUS wouldn't be the institution it is without the many thousands of students that study here and such changes which impact almost every single person could be done more democratically I feel? Granted this is not a big issue of life and death but the fact of the matter is that it does affect the entire school population. Would really like to hear the general view of you guys out there."

1. Use the non-incognito version of any browser, log-in once to LumiNUS, save the user and password. Next time you want to login you wont have to key in anything. For example on Chrome, I just click the username field, press down, press enter and I'm in. Every website will log you out after a certain period of inactivity due to security reasons. 

2. Use Panopto. There was an announcement on our beloved IVLE to use it.

3. Refer to point 2

4. LumiNUS' only problem used to be that it was slow. It's pretty much fixed now. What other features of IVLE do you think are lacking in LumiNUS apart from the 2 which can be fixed by you? User interfaces are often not well-received due to an innate inability to adapt. It takes time since you are just transiting. However I do agree I prefer the way IVLE looks more than LumiNUS; personal preference."

I don't know why we keep crossing path at the wrong time even though it always feels right. When we first met three years ago, sparks flew instantly but you were in a relationship with another girl long before university starts. Even though you told several people about your feelings about me, neither of us acted upon those feelings because it didn't feel like the right thing to do. Several other dramas occurred as we went through university and I have thought you are a closed chapter to me. We have both dated other people and didn't have any direct contact for a long time. Until lately when fate pulled us together and you took the chance, which took me by surprise because I also thought you would have forgotten about me long ago. This time no one really stood between us but there is a continent and 14 hours of flight and 7 hours of time zone difference. It made me wonder why some people like us have to repeatedly cross path, only to realise again and again that it is not right. When will I finally learn that we are only good in theory but never did we have any chance to work, so that I won't work up all these feelings the next time I meet you halfway. It would take me awhile to let go of you (again) and move on with my life (again).

I know everyone else is tired too. I can see it in many of my groupmates' faces that they are struggling to keep up, to stay afloat and on top of the crazy whirlwind of schoolwork, projects, meetings, etc. Maybe I'm misreading but I can see a kind of blank despair and uncertainty in their eyes.

Every time I feel like I'm going to drown in the never-ending pile of work, I google for this poem by William Henry Davies, called -

Leisure

What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.

A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.


Every time I finish reading it, I feel like crying. Because I have no time to stand and stare, and my life is just flying by. Every year comes by more quickly than the previous one, and months creep past without notice. Everyone is sprinting in all directions, towards their life goals - better grades, job promotions, internship opportunities, overseas exchange, more money, more branded goods, more holidays, - is it worth the chase? 

In the flurry of events and frenzied pace of life, I think I've lost myself."
1041,60612,I recently got a long overdue catch up with an FASS friend who asked how was life in SoC. He was quite shocked to find out that the SoC profs are more hands-off and often students end up struggling when thrown into assignments that they know nothing about. Whereas I was surprised at how much hand holding the FASS profs did like provide all the resources they will need to do their projects. I always thought that uni = adult learning = teach bare minimum and find out the other 90% yourself one way or another. He also had no idea that the average CAP for SoC (3.5? Am I right?) is so much lower than that in FASS. I dont know what to make of this information. I remember feeling quite overwhelmed since I had no computing background and I still struggle until now but at least I know what to expect or rather what not to expect. I want to know if anyone else feels like this difference in teaching is good or can be improved? 
1042,60611,"Hi again,

I posted #60611, and from the comments I think a lot of people have misinterpreted my reason for posting it. I was not looking for reassurance of my abilities. I was trying to find out if sexism and gender discrimination is a problem that many girls like myself face, or that I'm just unlucky. At the same time, I wanted to raise awareness of implicit gender bias. A lot of us think that we are not sexist. However, because we grew up in an environment where gender stereotypes were ""imprinted"" onto us, sometimes we subconsciously are. Now that we are aware that we might be unintentionally biased, we can make a conscious effort to correct/unlearn it. 

You are not good with kids ""for a guy"", just because traditionally women are the caretakers. You are good with kids, period. You are not a good engineer (or programmer, or mathematician, or scientist, etc) ""for a girl"". You are good regardless of your gender. Stereotypes are unhealthy for everyone. 

Lastly, to the girls in male-dominated fields who feel like you don't belong, feel like you're less competent, less qualified, or just /less/, I want to tell you that you are not. You earned your spot to be there, and you deserve to be there as much as everyone around you does. Don't let anyone tell you that you are only valued just because you are a girl (in a sea of guys), and don't let anyone judge you based on that. 

Thank you all once again for your time, and I hope we can work towards a more equitable society. "
1043,60610,"#60610 here

Hey Prof Ben, sorry if it came across that way but I didn't mean to say you were elitist and I probably should have phrased it differently. Didn't mean to be rude or anything. I think it's that you remind us regularly that the job market as of today is still quite elitist in nature (at least for first jobs) and the motivations behind it, when many profs in my course (I'm not in CS but in a fluffier subject) like to downplay its importance which is a real source of frustration. This is especially ironic when they always say they will use the bell curve. It's always the essays which I've struggled with scoring, the mods where it's a set answer I've done much better. You know I wish my profs would release the solutions so I knew where I went wrong, but that hasn't happened.

Again, I hope you understand from the post that I actually agree with the fact that you say what needs to be said and treat us like young adults instead of kids which need coddling. University should be a time where students grow up, maybe you could say grades are not the only thing and there are other things which matter true, but downplaying it's importance just to make students feel better doesn't fix anything. Going to a consult only to hear that the score doesn't suck doesn't fix anything. A spade is a spade. When you ask, what you want to know is what you missed and what was expected which led to your score so that you don't suck the next time, that's way more important.

I didn't expect such a long response tbh, but I've read it and this sincere piece of advice, I'll take it. I generally agree with most of what you said, but I do have this to say, I think everyone compares upwards generally because that's where we want to end up to be answerable to ourselves and our loved ones. Knowing yourself to be fortunate is one thing, but using that as an excuse to lose one's drive and cave into self-consolation gets us nowhere. There are many kids who want to get into uni but don't on their first try, but they don't just take that no for an answer. They strive and work hard in what they do, eager to prove themselves, some of them coming in as mature candidates while others work their way up into their careers to prove that they've got what it takes to succeed. That's what we should be inspiring, instead of saying because you're in nus you're exceptional because you're the best. Frankly, this sort of behaviour not only reinforces societal stereotypes against non-uni kids, but can make those in uni develop complacency and a sense of entitlement. 

Lastly, I think your idea of pushing for mastery over a one time test is really ambitious, and even though I may not directly benefit from this change since I'm not in CS, I wish you and your team all the best in getting these tough but necessary reforms passed and hope it catches on across the entire university. It's exciting to have such a deep exchange of views, and I hope there aren't any hard feelings and I sincerely apologise if there was anything I said that was personally offensive in any way, but I'll be blunt this talk about 'exceptional because you're here' needs to stop."

Free 4MCs? I would willingly have the school take away 4MCs away from the current credits I have completed just for a chance to join Orbital. And no, it is also not because I wish I could skip NOC interviews. 

Coming from a non-soc faculty, it is really difficult for someone like me to meet and learn from SOC students. It doesn't help that so many of my non-soc friends have literally given up on CS after / while taking CS1010. So to me, it's an incredible opportunity to network, gain experience, get feedback, and work with SOC students. I would definitely even consider crashing the seminars if I could actually get information on where they are held and at what time. So yes, there are still people out there who want to join orbital for the right reasons, not just for the free 4MCs as you suggested. 

I could probably (and am going to have to) learn everything by myself, but the way I see it, orbital is NOT overrated; its true value lies in allowing peers to come together to work on a project and learn from each other. But as you said, ""there is no room to blame the organizing committee"" and ""grow up"", and I completely agree. Just gotta go a different route and work on my own projects, on my own during the summer. 

Really hope the organizing committee considers increasing the quota for non-soc students in the future, so that students from other faculties will get the chance to work with soc students more.

1050,60593,"I’m in year 4 now and I feel exactly the same way I did when I first entered NUS 4 years ago. Happy and naive. 

I have been liking someone for 6 years now. I met him in JC. I know he doesn’t love me back,but so? 

I spend every day in NUS, from year 1 to year 4, stalking him on Instagram and Snapchat. It’s a one sided relationship for 6 years, and I always find excuses to talk to him. Whenever he responds, I feel Super happy. Whenever I talk to him over the phone, my heart swells with joy.

I knew right from the start that he doesn’t feel the same way back, but he DOESNT OWE ME ANYTHING. Loving him one-sided, unconditionally, has become the GREATEST OF ALL JOYS. I don’t expect anything from him in return, yes, for all the 6 years. 

In year 1 and year 2, I have watched with confusion how my friends cried and cried and cried after they were dumped. I told them about this guy whom I love unconditionally without expectations, and they told me that they cried because they follow the basic human nature of being “ selfish”. They said no human isn’t “selfish”, everyone will feel sad if love isn’t returned. Simply because of selfishness.

In year 3, 4 friends came to me and told me straight to my face that I “need help” because I was “weird”. They proceeded on to warn me that I am “not being fair to myself” and I’m supposedly “hurt deep inside”(...????) I don’t understand, which part of it is supposed to hurt? Am I supposed to become selfish too? 

It’s already year 4, I have secured a job offer (company name not disclosed here to remain anonymous) and I’m still in love with that same someone whose smile, whose words, whose social media posts, have kept me warm and happy for the past 6 years, 4 in NUS and 2 in JC. I have rejected every other guy whom I feel can’t even measure up. 

And no, I did not shed a single tear when I think of him.

Sorry, but is there a “reason” why it’s “compulsory” for me to feel sad when it’s unrequited? Is there some “rule” that dictates I have to bawl my eyes out stalking his social media?

If you feel hurt in a one sided relationship, does that mean you’re “selfish”? And if I don’t feel hurt, it means I’m “selfless” and “saint-like”? (I’m not, by the way)

A. Yes there are limited seats. That is how programs work. Sign-ups could have been managed better, but limited is limited. 

B. It isn't first-come-first-served. Where do people get this idea? If they even read about Orbital, it explicitly says it prioritizes cs freshies. 

And you know what? This post is more than just about Orbital. It is also about how some modules are discussed here. What really gets to me is a certain entitled mindset. I don't mean to generalize, but it seems to come a lot from younger compsci majors. 

When you don't get something you want, do you first ask yourself ""why didn't I get it?"" and ""what else can I do?"". But instead, some people have a knee jerk reacion of ""I should get everything I want, and if I don't, it is someone else's fault. It is always someone else not catering to me"" and ""If I don't get what I want or I don't like something, I can't engage in polite feedback and discussion. Just change the whole system to fit my individual desires, even if it makes no sense for the whole"".

CS is an awesome major and we really need people studying it. But that doesnt mean the world revolves around you just because you study it. The world does not change orbit just because CS is the hot new thing and just because you got As in your youth. If you give feedback in a way that is weirdly demanding, clearly rude and overly entitled, I expect that it won't be taken seriously. "
1058,60580,"To #60376: I had a similar experience too with one of the UHC psychiatrists during the pre-uni mental health assessment, but can't remember who it was :/ I remember feeling quite shocked by the way she was speaking to me, because aren't psychiatrists supposed to be empathetic, or at the very least fake it? I forgot about it eventually until now because I thought I was just being delusional, but maybe I was wrong. Throughout the whole assessment it felt like she had this unfeigned disgust towards me, like I was wasting her time for being there. For context I already have difficulty talking to counsellors or therapists but when she was asking stuff like ""so what trauma happen to you"" ""why do you have depression"" in this contemptuous way I got even more withdrawn, and  I felt guilty because she was obviously frustrated with me. I know psychiatrists aren't supposed to do a therapist's job and talk through everything but it was such a stark contrast to the psychiatrists I've been with in the hospital. It was so bad to the point that at the end when she asked me to decide whether to transfer from the hospital to UHC for treatment with her it was a straight-up no from me even though going to the UHC would be free and I already have trouble affording to go to the hospital. Maybe if more come forward, something might be done."

I prided myself on my sense of direction, once. But I pivoted, grew afraid that I wasn't passionate enough, wasn't cut out for it or that what I wanted didn't have a future in Singapore. ""You've got your As,"" people told me, or maybe I told myself that too. ""You came from a great school. You're here, by virtue of hard work and privilege. Why throw it all away for something you're not even certain about?""

So I made my decision. Chose a course I was fairly interested in and hardly cared for, but it was safe. For months I was convinced it was fine. Today I finally let myself think about what could have been, what my future now might be. Is it presumptuous to ponder over that from my position in the present? No idea, but those thoughts creep into my head all the same.

""It's never too late to change,"" people tell me that too, as do I. But I have to muster up the courage first.

1104,60491,"Hi #60440, I've got a similar problem to you, but kinda different.

My boyfriend's fine, we've been dating about 2 years too. He's not very good looking, and I don't know if I'm okay with it, but that's not the biggest problem. The real problem is actually quite small, really.

Thing is, he tries hard to maintain the idea that he's good at sex, but he's not all that good. He's had maybe quite a bit of experience, but he just doesn't make the cut. He just doesn't know how to please a lady I guess.

To make things worse for him, his little brother is really quite small. I read somewhere that the Singapore average is about 4.5? He's definitely not near that length, though he tries hard to. He says it's the lower body fats concealing it, but honestly, he's not fat. He's literally got almost no fat.

So well... to quote your question, recently I have been re-questioning my feelings for him because I feel like he's not attractive enough. He's ""shorter"" than the average guy, and doesn't have killer looks nor body. I feel selfish thinking this way, but I can't help it. Should I leave him?

1113,60478,"Please be nice as you read this, thank you. I’m a 25yo female. I’ve always been brought up by my mom only. My biological father passed away before I was even born. Then I had a step father throughout my childhood years but was under the impression that he was my real father until I was older. However, this step father eventually left my life too. And he wasn’t very significant in my life after a while because we stayed separately. And as a child I’ve always been afraid of him and have a fear towards him. In my late teens to current adult life, my mother has a partner. Whom she told me; he’s the best amongst them all, my step father and my biological father. However as we all know, all good things come to an end. He passed away due to an illness last year. Ever since then, my mother has been very lost. She does everything a curious teenage girl would. Texting and calling other men while reminiscing the one she love who is gone. She is a perfect mother, don’t get me wrong. She brought me up really well. She would sacrifice anything for me and I know I’m the first in her life no matter what. Not all these men. However, I feel uncomfortable. I know she has to find her happiness somehow and somebody to grow old with her since she’s only barely half a century old. I do encourage her to do that cos I know I’ll have to get married sometime in life and can’t be with her all the time. But I can’t help feeling uncomfortable. And having this distant feeling with her and thinking that she’s strange and not the mother whom I used to know before I reached adulthood. Maybe, it’s because I haven’t been growing up in an environment with a proper father so I’m not used to seeing her being affectionate with men. I did not see that irl, it was the phone calls; way of speech and looking at her use her phone to text. I get really sad sometimes feeling that I can’t get back the mother I knew when growing up. She has her own life to live, I know that. That’s why I really need advise on how I should think about this. More importantly, just last night. By accident, I found out that she actually has an adult toy. My perfect mother all these while actually has an adult toy. I was in complete shock. Many scenarios played in my head which I wish she wouldn’t do. After composing myself, I realised that she after all is a human being. And have her needs. But I wish she wouldn’t do it in front of the men or something. Maybe she needed it because he passed on. And after serious thoughts I didn’t mind if it was an alone activity. Just not on video calls with men. Maybe y’all wouldn’t understand why I’m shocked by that. Being a single child and brought up by a single mom, my mom is all that I have all my life. She is basically my life. We only have each other. I can’t explain the bond between us anymore explicitly, but I hope you get me. Knowing that my mom has that toy, and calling men etc has really made me feel disappointed, sad, confused, strange and I don’t know what to do. Since last night until now when I see her, I think about the toy. When she talk to me, I feel distant. I see her differently now and I hate that I can’t help it. I really don’t want to feel this way. I didn’t tell her about it. I wanted to tell my bf and close friends about it but I felt that it’s my mom’s privacy so I’m keeping it to myself. But it’s making me die on the inside. What should I do? 

Your kind advice will be deeply appreciated, thank you. "

1133,60445,"Help. This has been bothering me for so long and I don't know where to seek help. 

I grew up being close to my dad but we grew distant after my sisters were born. He would start hitting me in secondary school whenever I was rude to him and that caused us to drift even further. Fast forward to JC where I was sitting on the sofa one day(in a loose pants till mid thigh), I caught my father, who was sitting on the floor, trying to tilt his head forward to look through the gap of my pants. I gave him the benefit of doubt and did not think much into it. I would also revise till late night in that period and would end up sleeping on the chair in my room/ sitting on the bed, but would always wake up lying on the bed with the lights off. I felt uncomfortable about it, and confronted my father one day in the presence of the rest of my family. He denied it, and the rest of the family also said that they didn't do it. The thing is, I have no history of sleep walking, so I couldn't be the one switching off the lights and I have also tried to sleep sitting on my bed, and woke up in the same posture the next day. Also, I know from young that my father would sometimes come out of the room at night to use the bathroom/cover blankets for me. What hurt me the most was that had he admit that he was the one who switched off the lights and helped me in getting a more comfortable position to sleep, I would have taken it as a gesture done out of care and concern. But he denied it, and if he had nothing to hide, why would he? Me not being convinced and his denial led to frequent fights, and during one of those fights, he told me, ""I'm already in my middle age, I have a wife and children, and there are also so many other girls in the streets, why do you think I would want to look to you?"" That got me thinking that, maybe he is right, and I want to believe that someone so related in blood to me would not cause me so much hurt and pain. But similar instances involving the lights still happens. This was before university started. From then on, I would also stop myself from looking at him whenever I am in shorts so that I wouldn't second guess what he is staring at. I wanted to trust him so much as my father. 

Now, half way into uni, the feeling is back again. One time, I caught him tilting his head slightly to the right, looking at my shorts when he was standing beside the door as I unlocked it. There was another instance where I was walking to the living room in fbt, and he was sitting on the floor. He was asking if I was going to have my dinner, but his eyes (which were at eye level of my shorts) never left my fbt. These are just a few instances of what I experienced. I always told myself that as my father, supposedly my role model, and someone that I should respect and look up to, I want to believe him that he will never do this to his own daughter. But I really can't deceive myself anymore. I constantly feel uneasy at home, and was stressed whenever I need to pass by the living room to go to school when I am in shorts, even when they are all of decent lengths. I feel that I'm living with a tikopek at home, instead of a supposedly loving figure, and I would sometimes have a loss of appetite over it. Given the student loan I have, I don't think I have the financial means to live on my own. Is there any way I can seek legal help, or help of any other forms? Somebody please help me."

1136,60440,"Hi #60440, I've got a similar problem to you, but kinda different.

My boyfriend's fine, we've been dating about 2 years too. He's not very good looking, and I don't know if I'm okay with it, but that's not the biggest problem. The real problem is actually quite small, really.

Thing is, he tries hard to maintain the idea that he's good at sex, but he's not all that good. He's had maybe quite a bit of experience, but he just doesn't make the cut. He just doesn't know how to please a lady I guess.

To make things worse for him, his little brother is really quite small. I read somewhere that the Singapore average is about 4.5? He's definitely not near that length, though he tries hard to. He says it's the lower body fats concealing it, but honestly, he's not fat. He's literally got almost no fat.

So well... to quote your question, recently I have been re-questioning my feelings for him because I feel like he's not attractive enough. He's ""shorter"" than the average guy, and doesn't have killer looks nor body. I feel selfish thinking this way, but I can't help it. Should I leave him?

I cannot really help you with that, I would recommend to feedback to the bus operators to ask them to request making more handlebars to help provide more support. 

I do believe that it is a matter of the suspension, as well as how your drivers drive, along with the winding terrain you have around, which results in you rolling about. Just look up the underneath of the bus. They're supported by balloons or something, when cars are typically supported by springs.


Though, I'd say this: your handlebars are made of this:

OD 32 x 1.6 mm SS Tubes (looks and sounds like SS 304), with a centreline radius of around R = 127mm.

The process is draw-bending for the one at the front, and roll-bending for the ones you hold onto in the middle of the bus. 

You can sort of tell from measuring them. A quick google search, a vernier caliper and a few more tools could get that for you.

Sorry for the late reply, have been busy battling the bell curve.

I completely agree with you that the only reason Pharmacy and Nursing are curved is their ""traditional judgement"" of how these courses are Science courses. While this answer is politically correct, it vastly differs from the pragmatic approach our education system usually takes. 

As we all know, the bell curve is a prospective assignment of the normal distribution to grades, i.e. a cohort is expected to fare in an expected spread of grades. However, courses like Pharmacy and Nursing are heavily ""regimented"" in a fixed curriculum such that there is a fixed set of knowledge and skillset that every nurse or pharmacist is expected to possess in order to be competent in their roles. The implication of the bell curve is that students become more competitive over every single detail (to the point of unnecessity to fulfil job requirements) such that grades bear no significant meaning other than how exam-ready one is. Employers are as such given the liberty to be more selective of ""better"" students, and students who are not so exam smart but probably extremely capable at work are deprived of an opportunity to be employed. Hence my true question is, ""given the limitations of an educational institute to assess students' job performance, is this (the bell curve) really the best way to differentiate students?""

Also, I do agree that a pharm/nursing student need not see being a registered pharmacist or nurse as a be-all-end-all goal. There are certainly other opportunities to explore. Be that as it may, that does not mean that doctors are receiving the short-end of the stick. Similarly, many do not even stick to the major they read after graduating. Dr M is one such example. Regardless, Pharmacy has come up with a new Pharmaceutical Science major. I believe it's clear that Pharmacy was intended to be clinically-driven."

1174,60380,"#60336 your confession just shows how self-entitled you are, Strawberry Generation. Please look at the statistics; for the undergraduate intake in 2018/2019, there are 2147 students in School of Computing while there are 5421 students in Faculty of Engineering, which is slightly more than double of SoC’s. The Research Graduates in SoC has been counted as 283 while there are 1095 Research Graduates in FoE. (coursework graduates are excluded here because they share the same lecture/tutorial space as undergraduates). This is a whopping four times more! Additionally, SoC provide 5 courses while FoE has 10 courses.

FoE also has to allocate a lot of space for laboratories for all 10 departments, because most of them require huge equipment and most of the Research Graduates take up a lot of space and resource for their testing (in order to write their thesis). This is oppose to SoC’s “laboratory” work, which basically takes place in computer labs. FoE also has a canteen, which is shared with SDE, while SoC doesn’t even have one! There are also some external-linked research space that are within FoE (e.g. T-labs) which FoE students don’t use.

Given that there is COM1, COM2 and an upcoming COM3, AND SoC also uses i3, AS3 and AS6, I’m failing to see how NUS is not “prioritising” in giving SoC more space, especially when there is limited land to expand. And no matter how much SoC’s intake has increased, statistics has shown that it is still a relatively small Faculty.

Lastly, you’re a student at NUS. Can’t you at least do some research before making comments irresponsibly?!"

I forgot about it eventually until now because I thought I was just being delusional, but maybe I was wrong.

For context I already have difficulty talking to counsellors or therapists but when she was asking stuff like ""so what trauma happen to you"" ""why do you have depression"" in this contemptuous way I got even more withdrawn, and  I felt guilty because she was obviously frustrated with me. I know psychiatrists aren't supposed to do a therapist's job and talk through everything but it was such a stark contrast to the psychiatrists I've been with in the hospital. It was so bad to the point that at the end when she asked me to decide whether to transfer from the hospital to UHC for treatment with her it was a straight-up no from me even though going to the UHC would be free and I already have trouble affording to go to the hospital.

1203,60336,"#60336 your confession just shows how self-entitled you are, Strawberry Generation. Please look at the statistics; for the undergraduate intake in 2018/2019, there are 2147 students in School of Computing while there are 5421 students in Faculty of Engineering, which is slightly more than double of SoC’s. The Research Graduates in SoC has been counted as 283 while there are 1095 Research Graduates in FoE. (coursework graduates are excluded here because they share the same lecture/tutorial space as undergraduates). This is a whopping four times more! Additionally, SoC provide 5 courses while FoE has 10 courses.

FoE also has to allocate a lot of space for laboratories for all 10 departments, because most of them require huge equipment and most of the Research Graduates take up a lot of space and resource for their testing (in order to write their thesis). This is oppose to SoC’s “laboratory” work, which basically takes place in computer labs. FoE also has a canteen, which is shared with SDE, while SoC doesn’t even have one! There are also some external-linked research space that are within FoE (e.g. T-labs) which FoE students don’t use.

Given that there is COM1, COM2 and an upcoming COM3, AND SoC also uses i3, AS3 and AS6, I’m failing to see how NUS is not “prioritising” in giving SoC more space, especially when there is limited land to expand. And no matter how much SoC’s intake has increased, statistics has shown that it is still a relatively small Faculty.

1223,60298,"I recently went back to NUS for a career fair to promote my current company, hiring software developers and data analysts. I was surprised by the ratio of candidates looking for software development vs 'data science' roles. For every 1 CV I received for software development, I received something like 5-8 'data science' CV. In terms of actual positions available, the ratio should have been reversed! Further, most of our data science roles require masters degree and above. 

Granted, data-savviness  is a plus in almost all roles, candidates specifically looking for 'data science' roles are shooting themselves in the foot because (1) purely data science roles are limited, and (2) Bachelors' are often not sufficient for those roles.

Instead, what is really short in the market are people who can write software. People who can write good, clean code, who can build scalable systems, and, who can understand algorithmic time complexity and make appropriate trade-offs - software engineers in essence. 

My advice to those who are still in school: Focus on your fundamentals. Don't get seduced by the latest fads, there are far more jobs out there for software engineers than 'data scientist'."

1225,60294,"#60102 - happiness is subjective, i can't claim to know what makes you happy, or if they're ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""socially trendy to have"". However, i date say that your understanding of the average person around you is superficial at best.

The person thinking about BTO? he might be chasing it because it makes him happy to spend time with his wife in a place they can call their own.

The person thinking about pay? he might be a huge gaming nerd who blows dollars on his gaming rig and vidya (that's me). 

The person who wants a car? he might derive his happiness from long quiet drives, or frequent road trips up north (further than jb)

The person who sells his soul to his employer might be doing so because the job is fun, challenging, meaningful.

The people worrying about wedding costs / great vacations might be materialistic,, who are we to judge if that makes them happy. 

The rest of the faceless people you think have no soul? they might be dancers, part time volunteers, artists, Han culture enthusiasts, amateur home chefs or semi pro gamers. You don't see it because you don't look hard enough.

Projecting your own version of happiness on people and calling them boring because their only source of fun is that one vacation a year shows how much you understand your peers. It also reflects poorly on you.

If you want to get to know a person, look at who they choose to spend their time with. If you feel like you're surrounded with boring people, consider the possibility that your own personality is the one that's keeping you from meeting the cool ones. Don't just talk to people, understand them.Peace out

1230,60286,Really confused about the bell curve....does it mean that there bound to be someone get failed(F) even though the class only has 50 students and all students get grades above 60?
1231,60285,"Honestly speaking, if SOC is unable to cope with the increase in intake for CS, they should probably just reduce the intake back to the original. Helps to prevent oversupply of computing grads, and each student gets more attention and help from the lecturers. Win win situation."
1232,60284,"Thank you #60284, and many others who replied.
Sorry for the late reply, have been busy battling the bell curve.

I completely agree with you that the only reason Pharmacy and Nursing are curved is their ""traditional judgement"" of how these courses are Science courses. While this answer is politically correct, it vastly differs from the pragmatic approach our education system usually takes. 

As we all know, the bell curve is a prospective assignment of the normal distribution to grades, i.e. a cohort is expected to fare in an expected spread of grades. However, courses like Pharmacy and Nursing are heavily ""regimented"" in a fixed curriculum such that there is a fixed set of knowledge and skillset that every nurse or pharmacist is expected to possess in order to be competent in their roles. The implication of the bell curve is that students become more competitive over every single detail (to the point of unnecessity to fulfil job requirements) such that grades bear no significant meaning other than how exam-ready one is. Employers are as such given the liberty to be more selective of ""better"" students, and students who are not so exam smart but probably extremely capable at work are deprived of an opportunity to be employed. Hence my true question is, ""given the limitations of an educational institute to assess students' job performance, is this (the bell curve) really the best way to differentiate students?""

Also, I do agree that a pharm/nursing student need not see being a registered pharmacist or nurse as a be-all-end-all goal. There are certainly other opportunities to explore. Be that as it may, that does not mean that doctors are receiving the short-end of the stick. Similarly, many do not even stick to the major they read after graduating. Dr M is one such example. Regardless, Pharmacy has come up with a new Pharmaceutical Science major. I believe it's clear that Pharmacy was intended to be clinically-driven."

1249,60259,"#60102 - happiness is subjective, i can't claim to know what makes you happy, or if they're ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""socially trendy to have"". However, i date say that your understanding of the average person around you is superficial at best.

The person thinking about BTO? he might be chasing it because it makes him happy to spend time with his wife in a place they can call their own.

The person thinking about pay? he might be a huge gaming nerd who blows dollars on his gaming rig and vidya (that's me). 

The person who wants a car? he might derive his happiness from long quiet drives, or frequent road trips up north (further than jb)

The person who sells his soul to his employer might be doing so because the job is fun, challenging, meaningful.

The people worrying about wedding costs / great vacations might be materialistic,, who are we to judge if that makes them happy. 

The rest of the faceless people you think have no soul? they might be dancers, part time volunteers, artists, Han culture enthusiasts, amateur home chefs or semi pro gamers. You don't see it because you don't look hard enough.

Projecting your own version of happiness on people and calling them boring because their only source of fun is that one vacation a year shows how much you understand your peers. It also reflects poorly on you.

If you want to get to know a person, look at who they choose to spend their time with. If you feel like you're surrounded with boring people, consider the possibility that your own personality is the one that's keeping you from meeting the cool ones. Don't just talk to people, understand them.Peace out

You knew from the start they're seeing someone else.
It didn't matter to you; they were just a friend you saw in tutorial. Every week, you walk into class and settle down next to them.
It starts out just focusing on work-related things. How to solve this and that tutorial question. Almost business-like. But soon you find common interests. Soon you find them laughing, and they're making you laugh too. Soon you find a friend you can trust.
And it goes on. You start looking forward to these tutorials every week. Just that 1 hour of class that used to be so boring has become so entertaining, so exciting -- it's now the highlight of your week. It's not so much the content, but the time spent with them. Perhaps you even muster the courage to ask them out for meals, and to study together outside of class.
And then comes the fall.
Their smile, their voice, their humour, their mindset, their reactions, their outlook on life. You fall for every detail. And it's a deep fall. You want to spend every day with this person, you want to go through life's ups and downs with them. You know you complement each other well. They match your needs and you match theirs perfectly.

1267,60229,"With regards to the rants of CS2030, while I agree that some parts of the module could be better improved, such as the last minute releasing of practical assessment scope (although i can understand that the lecturer had emergency situations at home but I feel that the other lecturers or TA could help post the announcement), I feel that the module isn't as bad as what everyone here is making it out to be. As someone who has taken many CS modules already and currently taking CS2030 with no Java and OOP background, there are several modules out there where you have to google all your answers especially for the coding assignments. You will realise some of the assignments are totally different from whatever has been taught in class. That's because theory and practical application are always different. People always told you whatever you learn in school won't apply to your jobs eventually right? Then, will you complain of how the professors don't spoonfeed you everything? This is university, one should be prepared to be a more independent learner.
Also, the complaining of how the lectures are useless. I disagree to a pretty large extent. Every live demo that the lecturer makes has a point. Showing how certain code works and how certain codes don't. It's through this we learn how the Java compiler works so that we won't commit the mistakes. If you feel it hard to catch up during the actual lecture, I really suggest you to webcast it. Rewind back whenever you need to, it really helps in understanding. :)
However, I agree with the module's workload is  higher than most modules. It might be because CS2030 and CS2040 are both foundation modules which help us to build a stronger foundation for our other modules, and as these modules are heavily based on coding practices so the module workload is very high (because most of us need alot of time to debug too). To all CS2030 coursemates, all the best and let's last through this semester ! The higher level modules may be slightly better (or is it because I got used to it?). Let's stop complaining about our professors. To be honest, I think they are some of the better professors in SOC."

I feel irritated/annoyed when I see an Ah Soh suddenly kiap (Note: for foreigners, in SG lingo this is equivalent to “clutched”) their handbag at the sight of someone who just wants to occupy an adjoining empty table with friends/family at a kopitiam or some eatery. Maybe for my situation, “is it cause I am from a minority race?” Haha, but honestly, I notice it happen when I am with my family or friends of the same ethnicity.

Maybe those Ah Soh were a victim of theft while at a kopitiam, but this is my experience I am sharing and I think it is rooted in some stereotype.

So, the most recent experience was my most memorable. To give you, the reader, an idea of the circumstances, this happened at a cafe in the heartlands. The Ah Soh suddenly kiap her handbag and we just took our seats. Since I was seating diagonally opposite her, I could catch her making side glances.

I felt annoyed but thankfully the event was short lived. The watch dealer I was meeting arrived. He took out the gold Rolex that I wanted to buy for my dad. In the course of negotiating prices, I took out my own gold Rolex to do comparative Quality Control checks. I noticed the Ah Soh’s demeanor had changed, especially when I took out the cash to pay for the watch. After the dealer left, I happened to turn to “look” at her, it was my golden moment to kiap my Rolexes in her presence :)"

1. “Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part.”
- Last year, 206 teams (412 students) was accepted into Orbital. This year, 576 students are accepted into Orbital. With a 40% increase in intake even though the number of students enrolling into SoC is much lower, how is it fair to say that the coordinator had bad planning? Note that there wasn’t anyone whining about Orbital unlike the kids this year. 

2. “It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day.”
- The coordinator’s job is not to wait for you to apply. The onus is on you to apply before all slots are filled.

In response to #60159
1. “So what kind of concerns are there to prevent taking in more students for Orbital? The cohort size is 1k, yet the intake is only 500.”
- Students need to be graded on the level of achievement. This requires manpower nonetheless. The purpose of the module is for seniors to mentor students on taking the first steps towards software engineering, and not a loophole for students to do shit work and get 4MCs. The higher the number of students accepted, the lower the standards of the mentors. 

2. If you can self learn and not go for workshops, why would you even need Orbital? It sounded like you are upset that there isn’t an opportunity to get 4MC even though you supposedly took it. 

3. “If your server could not handle the load of many projects registered, well…”
The purpose of the system is to accept X number of students. Clearly, that purpose has been achieved when 576 students are able to apply for it. 

4. Unfortunately, there is just a limited number of slots available for orbital. That was the same last year, it is the same this year. It has been propagated to the students that there are limited slots and its allocation is FCFS. 

Frankly, the orbital slots are final. There is just no use whining on the telegram group or on NUSWhispers. The amount of whining on these platforms is really alarming and shows the level of entitlement that you have. Just because you are in SoC, just because you are a CS major doesn’t automatically mean you are entitled to participate in Orbital and that all other majors are not as deserving of a slot as you. 

On a personal note, it’s really time for the year 1 CS students to realise that’s CS is not all cushy with free swags, flexible working hours and 5 digits intern pay. You have to earn every single one of them. Whining will get you nowhere.   It’s really time to mature up and actually ask yourself what is important to you. While the top students in SoC earn 10+k monthly, the average CS students don’t even earn half of that. It is really time to wake up and reflect on what you really want to do in NUS, learn about the science of computation, or just get an easy 4MC from Orbital."

1280,60210,"To OP of #60181:

I'm sorry to hear that you are in a lot of emotional pain from your first breakup. I know that feeling. When I had my first breakup, the pain was so real my lungs literally hurt. It is as if my sadness turned into a physical grip on my lungs from within and I honestly couldn't breathe. The first night was the worst. I did not sleep at all and every time I closed my eyes, images of us spending time together immediately flashed by like a sappy rom-com and tears just kept flowing from my eyes. I hugged my bolster and all I could think of was how it felt like to be held in his arms. The worst thing is I couldn't stop thinking about the callous good-bye he gave me, the last words he said (and the things he did not say)after all the pathetic pleading and bawling on the phone, begging desperately not to abandon the love we had and the time we spent. 

Despite that, I knew I didn't want him back. Like you, I knew the relationship was bound to fail, so what's the point? 


Our first relationships tend to be very precious because it's the first time you realise how much love you have to give, how much room your heart can offer to the one special, lucky person. We dedicate so much energy and effort to our first love not only because we are blithely ignorant of the dangers that lie ahead, we are also blinded to the possibility that things could ever end. I thought I was going to marry my first boyfriend. Many people would want their first relationship to be the last so they never have to experience any massive heartbreak. Unfortunately, in the modern dating scene, that's hardly possible. 


I just want you to know that things will eventually be okay. I know, this banal proverbial phase is the last thing you want to hear. You may be searching for some ""tough love"" motivational talk urging you to move forward or you may want someone to commiserate with your plight by condemning your ex for ditching you. But these are emotional painkillers which aren't healthy in excessive dosage, and much less effective in treating the actual causes of your pain. In truth, there is no pills/words/encouragement that will instantly do the trick and take away the hurt you feel. 


You have to sit with the pain, let it wash all over you like a tidal wave and soak yourself in the misery until you've finally understood it enough to let it go. Sounds like philosophical fluff, but you have to actually commit yourself to it to grasp its essence.


What you can do now is to give yourself time and understand that things happen, with or without reason. As cliche as that may sound, when has time failed to heal wounds and fade scars? It will be really difficult trying to focus on your assignments/exams/work as images of her face is going to interrupt your waking moments, but these interruptions will gradually lessen. It may sound impossible at this point that you could ever stop thinking of her, about your past, but trust me - you will.


Some things you could do now to facilitate the letting go process: 

1. Remove everything that reminds you of her - presents, soft toys, pictures, PHONE NUMBER, emails, social media accounts. Be thorough, do not even leave a single memorabilia behind that may accidentally remind you of her when you're making progress in the future.


2. As much as you can handle it, continue to stick to your regular routine. She was a huge part of your regular routine, but you (and all of us humans) have the ability to adapt to changes. Do what you always do - go to school, go to work, go to gym, exercise, eat, watch tv, unwind, etc. Just keep being you as much as possible. Yes, there is still a part of your being that belongs to you and only you that she did not and could not take away. Nobody else can except you.


3. Talk about it to your family and friends, once you're ready. Verbalize the emotions, verbalize your thoughts - when the messy tangle of pain you feel is stringed into coherent sentences, for an audience - you, in part, externalize it and distance yourself from it. You rob it of its power to hurt you by materializing it into words, into something you can make sense of with verbal articulation. The empathy you get from your peers and support from your family will help very much. 

Unless this isn't a plausible solution because you don't have a friendly listening ear, write it down in a journal or type it on your phone or computer.


4. Eat healthily and sleep well. This seems irrelevant but I cannot tell you how much your physical state will aid in helping you to pick yourself up. Don't turn to alcohol to drown your sorrow - look at the long-term goals you're trying to achieve and having your body in a good state of health is a good place to start. It's also a way you can start channeling your energy to improve yourself and your life. All the devotion you've put into your past relationship, into her - it's time to invest it in yourself and you'll reap rewards soon enough. 


5. Do not start searching for rebounds/new relationships just to prove that you're still capable of loving and still deserving of love. That means do not download dating apps and delete all of them if you have, because it is tempting. You don't want someone else to get hurt and feel the same pain as you currently do. Rebounds are really the worst ways to recover from break-ups because you're not really recovering, you're just trying to divert the pain to another innocent party.


6. Lastly, forgive her and forgive yourself. Do not hold grudges deep within, do not resent - because you know the futility of it all. Why harbor hatred for someone else that you've once loved so deeply? Hard as it may be, learn to wish her all the happiness she deserves. You loved her for good reasons, and I'm sure in some way, she is still the same person that deserved your love. 


Good luck. And no, becoming reclusive, isolated, wary and jaded of love and people are not necessary what you will be after this experience. You can still love wholeheartedly the next person that touches your heart. The power to choose who you want to be in your next relationship, in your current non-romantic relationships - lies within you. 


To all my damaged souls, I hope you choose to keep your heart open for all the lovely people that may come your way.


P.S. If you need some virtual comfort, leave an anonymous email for contact. I can send some online empathy."

1283,60200,"Dear #60200,
It is quite simple really. Pharmacy and Nursing are courses that are bell-curved because the admin refuse to allow any changes to occur. Petitions and this idea that bell-curve should be abolished for these courses are not new. Yet we see now the bell-curve.
It is very simple why the admins do not allow for change. Pharmacy and Nursing are just NOT medicine and dentistry. Are they separate faculties? No, Pharmacy is treated as a Science course under FoS and Nursing students graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. If you do not even treat these healthcare courses as individual faculties like you do for dentistry with its small cohort or medicine  what makes you think the admin in NUS actually care about the welfare of these students? Treat them the same way that you treat the Science faculty with the bell-curve treatment that differentiates the students who already are of similar and high caliber for the sake of what? 
You have raised a fair point that I can only answer you that it is because of NUS' own traditional judgement of how these courses should be in terms of being bell-curved in addition to the fact that they are simply Science courses. There is literally no other reason why healthcare courses like Pharmacy and Nursing deserve this separate treatment from dentistry and medicine. 
If you really do want to change though, you can always try petition number 182637163 and see how it goes again. Will you be even given a non-BS explanation I don't know.

I must have stared at her for about 10minutes and she must have definitely sensed it because our eyes met. And for that brief second I felt like she was looking into my soul. My face was burning but I could not tear my eyes away even as she gave me one last glance and looked back out the window.
I wanted so desperately to approach her but while I was gathering my courage she stood up. I could only watch as she dropped at the 801C bus stop at Keat Hong and walked out of my life. 
I am so conflicted now. I still love my girlfriend and I think I should get her back? I know that we are compatible enough. But I think I might have just missed my soulmate... "

My bf and I will update each other about our whereabouts and the stuff we were doing but just recently he stopped doing it.

He used to tell me that he will be playing game, and told me to go ahead and rest first. However recently, he went on playing his games without telling me and I look like an idiot waiting for his replies and hoping that every notification i have will be a text from him.

Yesterday, he send me a text at about 11:20pm,  telling me that he will be going to sleep. So we said goodnight and we both went to sleep.

Just this morning, I casually open my zenly app and found out that his last location was in jb 9 hours ago. So I asked him if he went jb yesterday night and he told me he did. He said that it was a last minute thing. It just merely takes 10 seconds to type ""my friend last min jio me go jb"". Is it that hard?

He used to tell me that he will be going jb even it was a last minute thing.

1292,60191,"Ladies, please advise.

Is it normal for a girl to go out with other guy friends for 1 to 1 dinner and movies? There’s this girl I have been texting who has lots of guy friends and goes out with them 2-3 times a week. It is a 1 to 1 every single time. Every time I ask her about it, she would deny saying that she is just friends with them and that she prefers to meet in smaller groups. Is this another “There is nothing to worry about”, then 2 months later she gets attached kind of scenario?

Can I have some opinion or advice on this? It has been bothering me for a while. Is she just being dense or seeking for more options because I feel like a spare? I really don’t see how having so many 1 to 1 meet up with guys can be normal? Am I thinking too much? Please advice because I don't want this to end up as another heartbreak. "
1293,60189,"Dear CS2030's Professors and Lab Tutor Assistants,

Firstly, I would like to do an anonymous feedback to our Professors. To start off, I would like to apologise to both of you that I honestly do not know what have been happening in this module for the past 8 weeks. (Even after attending the weekly 2 hours of lecture, 2 hours of lab, 1 hour of tutorial and rewatching Monday and Wednesday's Webcasts)

For the first half of the semester, I felt that the prof does not even care for us.

He conducted his lecture by assuming that all of us already know Java (Object-Oriented Programming) and know how to use Vim. He doesn't fully utilize the lecture notes (Skipping slides here and there) but does a lot of live demos (Using terms that he assumed that we already know). These made our understanding and learning harder.

Yes, I know that we are now young-adults and we should be responsible with our own learning. However, if we need to learn everything on our own by searching on Google, then shouldn't I be paying my school fees to their company?

Next, may I know what is the purpose of attending the weekly 2 hours of lab? Every Tuesday Lab Routine: Arrive lab, => find a PC => login to codecrunch => code for 2 hours => dismiss => (Bring home my code, continue to code and submit by Sunday 23:59). Throughout the routine, my lab tutor assistant does not mention a word (Not even a single instruction, no guildance & no question was answered).

To all current and future lab tutor assistants, we know that you have obtained very good grades. However, if you cannot express yourselves or cannot answer any questions at all, then please do not register to be a TA (DO NOT REGISTER FOR THE $$). We really need people who can help us out!!

Regarding our Practical Assessment 1, both test date and test scope were released very last minutes. On the day itself, our PCs were spoiled and the instructions were not clearly stated. For example, if we were not allowed to change the Main method, why was it stated at the back of the Level?

Understand that the professors will be using their skeleton, Main.java and I have to revert my code as followed. This means that number of lines changed increases. According to this semester professor, they make use of AI to do the marking. Thus, I highly feel that the marking is not fair at all.

To be continued..."
1294,60187,"Sometimes I envy my classmates who come from wealthy background. I'm totally not one of them. My parents are not highly educated. They earn peanuts and always struggle to make end meets. Because of this, I am told to be more diligent, get a well-paying job and not end up like them. Since I was young, I have learned to manage my own money and be thrifty in my spending. 

Whenever I go out with some of my friends, they buy whatever they like without looking at the price. I know that their parents give them alot of money and can provide them with anything. Often, my friends would tease me for being thrifty. I would simply say ""thrift is a virtue"" but I felt terrible when they said that. 

However, I am still grateful that I have a roof over my head and food to fill me up. My parents know I do not spend alot, but still remind me to have proper meals. Even though they are unable to pay for my study, I manage to get a low wage part-time job as a cashier and finance myself without asking money from them. During school breaks when I earn more, I could give some money to my parents. 

There are valuable things that my parents taught me better what schools had taught me. These are values and characters that money could not buy. In the past, I grew up thinking that why can't my parents be like other parents? I was wrong, because my parents have always given me their best, like any other parents. Now, I become more independent and hardworking everyday. Soon, I am able to repay the love and care that my parents have given me. "
1295,60183,"I had a crush on my TA and didn't have the courage to ask him out. I just met him by chance yesterday.

I took his class one year ago, and he caught my eye with his good look. He was passionate in explaining things to students, and I found his foreigner's English accent so cute. My friends knew and kept teasing him when he came to help me with the assignment. I felt embarrassed but also curious about his reaction. He just smiled every time, and I guessed he couldn't do anything more than that as he's doing his job. I put a lot of effort into studying the module and got the highest score in his class, I hoped it could make him notice me that way.

I wanted to tell him when the semester ended, but my insecurity got in the way. He got that cute smile, muscular build, and a much fairer skin tone than mine. This sounded shitty to write out loud, but I kept wondering if I was beautiful enough for him.

I noticed him having dinner alone yesterday and joined him. We caught up and talked about personal stuff for the first time. He jokingly said he wanted to ask me out but somehow thought I had a boyfriend as I posted a lot of pics with my brother on Instagram. I was speechless.

 I confessed to him, but both of us knew it would not go anywhere. I will graduate soon and work overseas while he stays here for at least 3 years. We said goodbye, life went on. I keep fantasizing to be with him, but there is not much I can do now."

I cringed so hard when I read your post, no offence. I'm going to get a lot of flak for this, but the truth is if you stop acting so beta and acquire some self-worth and self-love, chances are you'll do much better. Your actions reflect those of a person who is desperate for companionship and that is an immediate no-no.

I may sound harsh here, but I sincerely just want to help. Seriously, invest in yourself - physically, mentally, emotionally, financially etc - and I dare you to return without results. 

Also, 'she dated close to about 10 other guys but none lasted more than 7 months' . WHAT - are you kidding me? Are you so dull as to not immediately spot these tell-tale signs from a mile away?

Nonetheless, all the best =)"

1. “So what kind of concerns are there to prevent taking in more students for Orbital? The cohort size is 1k, yet the intake is only 500.”
- Students need to be graded on the level of achievement. This requires manpower nonetheless. The purpose of the module is for seniors to mentor students on taking the first steps towards software engineering, and not a loophole for students to do shit work and get 4MCs. The higher the number of students accepted, the lower the standards of the mentors. 

2. If you can self learn and not go for workshops, why would you even need Orbital? It sounded like you are upset that there isn’t an opportunity to get 4MC even though you supposedly took it. 

3. “If your server could not handle the load of many projects registered, well…”
The purpose of the system is to accept X number of students. Clearly, that purpose has been achieved when 576 students are able to apply for it. 

4. Unfortunately, there is just a limited number of slots available for orbital. That was the same last year, it is the same this year. It has been propagated to the students that there are limited slots and its allocation is FCFS. 

Frankly, the orbital slots are final. There is just no use whining on the telegram group or on NUSWhispers. The amount of whining on these platforms is really alarming and shows the level of entitlement that you have. Just because you are in SoC, just because you are a CS major doesn’t automatically mean you are entitled to participate in Orbital and that all other majors are not as deserving of a slot as you. 

On a personal note, it’s really time for the year 1 CS students to realise that’s CS is not all cushy with free swags, flexible working hours and 5 digits intern pay. You have to earn every single one of them. Whining will get you nowhere.   It’s really time to mature up and actually ask yourself what is important to you. While the top students in SoC earn 10+k monthly, the average CS students don’t even earn half of that.

1305,60165,"To poster of #60105, who is jealous of her(?) best friend 

I've always had better friends than I think I deserve, and in your case I think I could understand your jealousy in the presence of someone you like but think you can never match up to. Well, in truth I don't think it's easily possible for people like us to ever feel like we will be good enough compared to those around us. They say confidence comes from within, but I think it's something you can also begin to have by believing in the people around you, like your best friend. Even if you don't understand why, everything points to her being really concerned for you. Maybe you attribute it to her just being a really perfect person, but don't forget that she likely sees something in you she values over many other people in her life - even if you can't see it yourself. Even if you don't think you're a great person at all, your friend probably really does believe you are worth her effort and friendship (or would she so readily listen to your troubles at 3am?). In your perspective maybe she's perfect (studies, looks etc), but I'm sure from her perspective she thinks highly of you as well (in ways you might think are less important but probably mean more to her). Point is, people value different things and the fact that one person (who I'm sure you also care for - or you won't feel bad about your jealousy) loves you despite whatever you think of yourself is a thing I hope you'll be able to be happy about, even if you are naturally envious of whatever you see she has that you don't.

Silly as it sounds, even if you see no positive traits in yourself, have some pride in and believe in the fact that someone as great at your friend believes in you for some reason or another, and hopefully you will start to see yourself in a better light. Your vision of yourself is important, but in times where you can only think of yourself in a negative light, don't forget to take into consideration your friend's positive view of you and draw some confidence from there!

- from someone who is also guiltily envious of her friends but has come to terms with the fact that somehow, they love her for reasons she cannot understand so perhaps she is worth something to someone"

1308,60161,"Hi there, hope you are doing alright, especially since the midterms are coming to the end. If you are feeling joyful, great! But if you are not, because of whatever is happening in your life, I need to let you know something.

That its okay.

It's okay to feel lost, it's okay to feel alone, it's okay to feel hurt, troubled, sad and stressed. We all know that feeling, that feeling we get when we see others having great fun on instagram while ours seem to be more lonely. That feeling when we grind hard but still don't get the grade we want. That feeling when we practice long hours and we are still put on the reserve team. That feeling seeing couples in public while we remain alone.

And I understand. It's frustrating you see, we all don't know where life is taking us, where we are heading to or what is going to happen next. We all want to be loved, to be cared for and to be proud of ourselves. At the end of the day, we all want to be proud of the life that we have lived.

Sometimes it's hard. It's really hard to find that meaning, the one that keeps you going everyday. To others we may seem strong, cheerful and happy. But deep down, we may be more brittle than we think.

I hope you are someone who is truly strong, and leading the life you want to live. If you are, great! Help someone who is struggling and lost. But if you aren't, I hope you realize this:

It's not easy being you.

You never chose to be born, you never told god you wanted to come to this world and live. For all we could know, you could have been born a prawn, swimming freely in the ocean. Yet, you are here, as a human being. You could have given up, you could have thrown in the towel a long time ago. But you didn't.

So the fact that you are still here, living, breathing and surviving. Take pride in that. You were thrown in this world and you hustled through and you know what? I'm proud of you. I'm proud that you chose to live, and not die. That alone, is an achievement.

Take pride in yourself, because it takes great courage to be you. It takes great courage to wake up in the morning, and be you. It takes great courage to experience those feelings of sadness and pain. It don't matter what you look like, or where you came from. If you don't like something in your life, change it, work hard for it, but if it doesn't work out, don't hate yourself for it.

In the end, everything will be okay. So if it's not okay, it's not the end. Hang in there, and don't give up. I don't believe you were created by chance. You were created because you were born to do great things. Your existence here, changes things. It changes the course of this world. You may not have realized it, but someone's life on this planet has changed because of you.

So go out there, and never stop being you, chasing that dream. Your dreams are suppose to live with you, and walk with you, but never to die with you. Don't take them to the grave with you.

Be loving and be caring. Don't judge another man, because everyone has a story. Villains are created, not born. If you are at the top, help someone else up. See someone in trouble? Help them. Take pride in being human and helping another, for the meaning of life is a life of meaning.

So hang in there, and sacrifice who you are today, for who you will become. You and I both know you can do this. You and I both know you want this, and you will do it, no matter the odds. If you are in pain and suffering, good. Because behind all that, is the person you want to be. 

""F.E.A.R - either you Forget Everything And Run, or you Face Everything And Rise""

Love,
The person sitting next to you tomorrow in lecture.

For those of you who don't know there are 2 types of BTC at museum, one going to BTC itself and one going to the terminal. If you get on or skip the wrong one it can be quite disastrous.

Today I was at BTC waiting for the bus back to Kent Ridge when I saw someone in a NUSSU shirt come out of the bus and inspect the bus signage from outside to make sure it changed correctly. He was also explaining the different signages to the driver and translating them, all the way back to KR.

So basically someone from NUSSU went all the way down to BTC to check on this issue! That was a really nice touch cos I didn't think they would work on something as technical as this. Someone must have complained about it, and they actually did something. I just hope he's getting paid for this."

Why is 80% of everyone else living a more fulfilling life than I am? That places me in the bottom 20% percentile. I’m not asking to outshine anyone, I average I happy already. I jus want to be “normal”.

Observation 1: 
 I have never done any shopping sprees where I buy so much until my hands are filled with shopping bags, and my bed is never filled with shopping hauls. Never. 80% of everyone else post MASSIVE shopping hauls online. Some even buy so much until the bed fill to the brim with clothes. Like, how? 

Yeah, if u shop at cheap places it’s like $5-$20 per item of clothing, but if you buy around 40 items, that adds up to a $200 spree? Errrr...how come everyone is able to go on this kind of $200 sprees? 

I saw, with my very own eyes, how my average-family girl pal managed to buy so much during shopping that even her suitcase could not close. It’s just.....so full. How? 

 how do normal people just....spend this much until whole hand filled with shopping bags? I never know what a massive shopping spree feels like. 

Observation 2:  
Not only is my wallet and shopping spree (and wardrobe) not full, my heart isn’t full either. I never laugh at jokes, I never laugh at funny things, I pretend to nod and smile just to be polite. I try to appear as if I am amused. I am not, deep inside. 

I envy those who laugh like crazy all the time. There’s nothing remotely funny about ANYTHING that ANYONE says or does. The laughter just doesn’t...flow out. There’s nothing inside. 

Observation 3: 
Not only do I never laugh, I hardly cry buckets either. I’ve seen normal people cry into tissue after tissue, some even filling the whole floor with used tissue when they cry. Some cry at touching movies until their eyes become swollen the next day. Some tear up at wedding proposals because they are overwhelmed by the love. 

Many showcase hose pipe-like tear ducts where tears flow non-stop after a breakup. Their tears, their feelings, just naturally flow so much. 

Why can’t I be the same? I never cry at anything. Nothing matters to me. I always wish one day I can feel so much that the tears naturally flow out (maybe during a movie?) but my insides are so empty. 

You see, NOTHING flows out because my life is coloured by one shade of grey called EMPTY. Money doesn’t flow out naturally during shopping sprees, laughter doesn’t flow out during funny things, and my tears never flow so much. (In fact, hardly?) 

How come I always get the short end of the stick? Am I being paranoid or......?

1315,60145,"Dear management of school of computing,

Recently, I wanted to sign up for the Orbital program. Then I found out that registration started at 4pm and ended at 8.30pm. Perhaps the coordinator is inexperienced in organising events or is inexperience in disseminating information. But alas, most people who are unable to attend a talk for which had limited seating do not know the registration deadline. In fact, I wanted to sign up at around 9.30pm which we can all agree is a good timing, usually early in fact for most events. 

I have known not very many event organisers who hold a registration in such a matter, in such blitz. It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day. Perhaps, he does not have an event to look up to such as your school of computing camps which has a long deadline for registration. Perhaps, he knows not that 4 hours of registration is not enough.

Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part. You should not have promoted it so that you can further limit the places available. 

Lets not talk about the event organiser’s inadequacies. It is not his fault. We should learn from bad examples. Once in a while such things happen.

She flosses her teeth twice a day and always nags at me to floss, when I told her flossing is a feminine thing she got really upset and pissed off like wtf? Have you even ever heard of men flossing? Other than dentists la but that's cause of their job. There was an instance where we were out with friends and we all split the bill, I discreetly asked her to lend me her credit card so I could pay and not look bad because I didn't have money. She didn't want to and just paid for me nd her share. Do you know how embarrassing it was for me? That night we got into an argument and she told me to get a job if I didn't want this to happen. She doesn't even understand that I'm waiting for the best job opportunity.

Whenever she shower, I will check her phone and I've seen her conversation with friends where they told her to find a better boyfriend. she just replied with ""haha no la"". She didn't even defend me??? She didn't even type some of my pros. 

Another thing is I've tried to ask her to resign because I don't think it's nice for her to be better than me. She should let me have a job first and my position should be higher than hers. If not I will look inferior to her. She was also really upset and I feel like she is not sensitive to my feelings at all.

I've asked her many times if we should get married or do bto but she has kept saying ""never mind la take it slow"" and I feel like she's not serious about us. I've already been so nice to her by waiting for her to marry me and honestly I could get tons of other girls if I wanted. She's so ungrateful and I feel like I should just break with her. Because I'm nice and we've been together for four years I will ask for her hand in marriage one last time.

I will be graduating this semester and have received a few job offers.
A common thing about these companies is, they mentioned that there will be a 1-year probation period, which is in the form of a 1-year contract. 

Is such scenarios common? Do these companies actually intend to convert those who perform well to full-time employees or are they using this technique so that they can hire new employees and prevent paying the 13-month bonus, certain benefits which only full-time employees are given (e.g. medical insurance)?

First there was the technical issue, which lasted from 4pm when the sign ups opened, all the way till almost 6pm. The website was basically inaccessible at that point in time. Then at the same time, there were caching issues which showed students who were able to load the site that the sign ups were closed even when it was open. 

Secondly, on the same day, from 6pm to 8pm, majority of the CS students had a CS2100 paper. This basically means that there was a two hour period where this group didn't have a chance to sign up. After the paper ended, we almost immediately got notified that the sign ups were closed. That isn't even close to fair is it, when basically half of SoC don't even get a chance at all to sign up.

But a few days later, she messaged me to meet up in person. I wanted to apologise for what I said, and to get some closure for our friendship of nearly 7 years if it couldn't be fixed, so I agreed to meet. At the meeting, she dropped a bombshell on me: she had been having romantic feelings for me for years.

I was shocked, but it did explain a lot of things: why she chose to hang out with me so often instead of her many other friends, her constant string of 'boyfriends' who never lasted more than 1-2 months. And yes, I was a little creeped out too.

Anyway, she asked me to go out with her. I was doubtful, but seeing as my dating prospects with guys are zero anyway I agreed to it even though I never considered being anything other than straight. We went on a few dates, and they were great. I never had the feeling of being loved by someone else before, but we clicked even better as partners than as friends. We talked for a long time about my feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, especially as it might affect us being in a romantic relationship, and I think I've gotten over it.

1339,60102,"#60102 - happiness is subjective, i can't claim to know what makes you happy, or if they're ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""socially trendy to have"". However, i date say that your understanding of the average person around you is superficial at best.

The person thinking about BTO? he might be chasing it because it makes him happy to spend time with his wife in a place they can call their own.

The person thinking about pay? he might be a huge gaming nerd who blows dollars on his gaming rig and vidya (that's me). 

The person who wants a car? he might derive his happiness from long quiet drives, or frequent road trips up north (further than jb)

The person who sells his soul to his employer might be doing so because the job is fun, challenging, meaningful.

The people worrying about wedding costs / great vacations might be materialistic,, who are we to judge if that makes them happy. 

The rest of the faceless people you think have no soul? they might be dancers, part time volunteers, artists, Han culture enthusiasts, amateur home chefs or semi pro gamers. You don't see it because you don't look hard enough.

Projecting your own version of happiness on people and calling them boring because their only source of fun is that one vacation a year shows how much you understand your peers. It also reflects poorly on you.

If you want to get to know a person, look at who they choose to spend their time with. If you feel like you're surrounded with boring people, consider the possibility that your own personality is the one that's keeping you from meeting the cool ones. Don't just talk to people, understand them.Peace out

After the paper, I saw her chatting with this guy while we were still sitting. I didn't know whether it was her boyfriend or simply a male friend.

It didn't matter. I eavesdropped on their conversation while keeping eye contact on my eye candy.  I also nodded occasionally to drop hint that I was eavesdropping.

After I reached home, I found her Facebook and complimented her on her beauty through Facebook message. She blocked me from Facebook afterward

I then found for her Instagram, so I continued complimenting her beauty through Instagram direct message despite knowing that that would only cause history to repeat itself.

1352,60078,"Being an introvert in a school assigned group of extroverts is difficult. At first I tried adapting myself when around them, being more enthusiastic, blah blah. But I realised two things. 

One, while I adapted to the way they shaped the group dynamics, they did not do the same for me. It was constantly me trying to fit in with them, than vice versa. It's very tiring. 

Two, even though I attempted to 'code switch' around them, they didn't seem receptive to me. There have been many instances, where whether intentionally or not(probably the latter), I have felt divided from the group. 

Little instances of social rejection, which though minor, do add up over the months. For instance, in a group conversation, never addressing me or looking at me even though i participate. Or another one, when we gather at the lab, one of the guys closes the circle of people standing around the bench, even though i am behind him, and i end up physically blocked from whatever is happening. Another one today: attendance sheet being passed around, one of them passes their pen to another group mate so he can sign. When it is my turn, they pass the sheet to me without even looking at me. As i reach for the pen and hold it, they grab it back wordlessly. I use my own pen. Yet another: Some people start laughing about something, I ask what's going on. Guy just looks at me and away. Little things that will sting anybody. I'm sure many would at this point just give up trying to fit in. And I choose to believe they probably don't do those things consciously. 

I understand that our personalities do not match. We don't need/want to be best buddies and hang out together, but i am trying to be a respectful group member. It's not easy for me either to try to fit in. Maybe it's partly the way I interact too of course. I can be reserved and a little awkward. I'm a bit older than them. I'm sure these extroverts find it exhausting/uncomfortable to chat with me and would rather chat within themselves. Fair enough, I don't mind and that would be good for me too. If they want to grab a drink by themselves sure i hope they have a great time. But ignoring or excluding someone in the same group is just...not a nice thing to do. 

I'm alright with it, more or less, because I realise it's not my problem and I need to be confident in myself. Today I just stopped trying to adapt to them to fit in, and had a really nice time in class. Much better than trying to fit in. I was my quiet self and had my break alone with a book and a coffee. It was nice to just do my own thing. The rest of the group looked like they had a good time too, so it was a win win. I know it's unusual to prefer spending break time alone vs chatting with a large bunch of people over food, but that's the way I've always been. And I think as I grow older, I'm learning to embrace that. 

Disclaimer: They are really smart, driven, kind people, as evidenced by...well a whole lot. This is just my perspective. Maybe I am somehow being the weird one here in the way I look/act/speak/am? Maybe I am being overly sensitive? Who knows. Just something I have been mulling over.

1353,60077,"There are a fee types of top students. 

1, the type that exercises regularly (even once or twice a week, but every week is regular), have generally good sleeping habits (consistent sleep cycles, very little ""last minute rushes""), great discipline (to read and do work for everything before classes) and generally enjoys what they are learning or doing; or can justify that whatever they are doing is for some higher goal. 

2, the type that has some kind of separate life from school, be it in sports, social ventures, volunteering, entrepreneurship, work etc and yet still does well in school due to good time management.

1 and 2 are possibly the same person

3, the type that has some kind of separate life from school, be it in sports, social ventures, volunteering etc. Maybe even gaming. However, 3 tends to engage in what society, studies, and ""experts"" call ""bad habits"". These include partying to 6am and going for 8am classes. Gaming till 11pm and submitting an assignment due 12midnight. Working on their businesses and largely ignoring their part in a group project until the deadline. 

Maybe 3 has some exaggerations but you get the idea. I'm sure we have met these 3 types before (top students are basically those FCH dean list like that) but don't you think its interesting that type 3 can be the top despite their ""bad habits"" be it in sleeping, exercise, diet, priorities etc.?

Thank you all very much for your views. I hope I did not come across as salty - maybe I am just FOMO. I was just hoping for some good comments. It is great that there are people who are receiving help - and also sad that there are many left behind. 

Perhaps the reason why we see so many help groups which accentuate gender and racial lines is because the discrimination and harassment has created a common 'experience' which they all can learn to overcome together.  But I am also of the opinion that everyone (from other demographics) should be open and learn about these because it does take two or more hands to clap assuming minds are open. 

In the end, I feel in any power dynamic situation as long as one demographic has majority control there is probably going to be some form of inherent discrimination (which is pretty much clear in many places regardless of which gender or race is on top of that power dynamic). How do we - as a diverse hodge podge of gender race religion socioeconomic classes  - prevent the propagation of this phenomenon?

Yes, car is a big ticket item but he is working in an office job so it doesn’t seem fair he chip in for it, because we only use it over weekends for dates. Guess I missed those out in my previous confession, my output is definitely more even though we’re earning the same range.

When I do my workouts, I really rip though, but I'm not exactly a skinny person. BMI's in the overweight category, but i daresay I'm fitter than the average dude.
Is it advisable not to consume protein shakes, if my goal is to lose weight? Even if I'm doing hour long cardio + strength workouts.
Also will consuming protein shakes cause me to look even bigger/bulkier than I already am, if i'm trying to avoid getting that look?

I ended up not getting any temp job at all, bc obviously no one wants to pay an A-level kid that much to work a few months. 

Now I'm in uni, and I realize-- if I take the 'true' (or at least close to true) market wages for my major, and divide it by the hours that singaporeans usually work (we overwork so much..) well my hourly wages would be less than $12 an hour. I could go through all these 4 years, graduate with good honors, and get a job that pays so low, my parents think it is beneath 18-year-olds...sigh. 

My mother had nothing but education till sec 4 and some short private courses, worked for only a few years in IT in the 90s, and during that time she made 3k a month...that's like 4k a month today.

I hate to say this but I was really tired of those endless arguments with you and your manipulative ways. I had to end things with you because I needed to save myself. How could you go around telling our friends that I am a moron for dating a poor guy?

Yes you are rich, you landed a prestigious job, you live in a freaking big penthouse and you drive a car that would make people turn heads. But you know what, I was never into all these to begin with. What I loved about you was how you always managed to crack me up with your wicked sense of humour and your endearing support in my darkest days. 

I really appreciate all that you have done for me. But our differences took a toil on us and left me with no choice but to give up on you. Believe it or not, I did love you. I'm sorry that I left you when you were just starting out your new job and needed my support.

I know I was being an ass and I apologise for moving on to someone new quickly. He may not live in a big house or drive a fancy car like you but he's very mature, caring and supportive. He may be just a poor student but he's willing to save up to get the best things he could for my birthday. 

It really doesn't matter how much you earn or how much money you have. All I want is just someone who can love me wholeheartedly. I rather be eating at hawker centre with him than having some petty argument with you at some fine dining restaurant you frequent. So please suck it up and move on already ok!?

I never really seeked extravagence in this life, I am a person happy living a normal life, getting a HDB and maybe owning a simple car. If I ever became wealthy, I would still want to live a humble life for I am not into the high SES stuff. The problem is a life together with her in the future, I am worried about not being able to provide her nice things and because of that I feel inadequete in many ways. For someone who is used to living in luxury, can they truly accept an average life even if they said they’re fine?

She’s a sweet girl but she’s someone with little regard for money as she buys stuff without thinking about the cost of it. I’m worried that she’ll spend my hard earned money away in the future and leave me if I am left with nothing. This might be my wild imagination running, but it is a reality that I might end up being in. 

In an idealistic world, love should transcend everything as we accept one another regardless of where they come from. Yet, the practical realities of life tells us otherwise, that wealth and status do matter and it can sometimes trascend love. 

How then should one react to being in such circumstance? Would you date someone like that?

This warning (pictured below) was sent on the SAME day as the deadline, with no prior warning beforehand, not even one week or 3 days in advance. With us students being so focused on the internship (I am also not taking any evening modules, so I'm never in NUS this sem) and doing our best for the company, how are they expecting us to churn out a report out of nowhere?!

Also, like any normal human being, we all tend to forget some stuff and need a bit of reminder beforehand. Instead they are expecting us to do EVERYTHING, asking my supervisor for the required content and churn out a good report in ONE day?! This is ridiculous. It's not even that hard to just tweak the email reminder system to send out another reminder 3 days or 1 week before.

My internship makes me busy enough with many more deadlines and thanks Engineering Internship Department, you don't even give us a link to the guidelines on your submission page and do I look like i have the time to google for it with my busy internship schedule?! Ridiculous. You could had just put the link to your guidelines which is on another website on the submission page.

When I asked my mentor about the guidelines of the report, he simply shot the arrow to the Engineering Internship Department without offering ANY form of assistance. And thanks Engineering Internship Department, accusing me of not taking responsibility as a student. NUS is supposed to at least remind us on these deadlines that are not even within the company. You call this preparing students for the working world?! More like, you are just giving students extra stress from dropping a surprise bomb. My polytechnic interns in my company receive their email to submit their reports earlier than ONE day.

The way my mentor and the Engineering Internship department is handling this is sub-standard and very unprofessional.

1395,60006,"Hello. I am the original author of #59956 - the one regarding splitting finances for wedding. Thank you for all the comments, i am flattered. 

Fun fact - my husband is younger than me by quite a bit (he is not xiao bai lian, dont worry). But that aside, I just want to say such mentality is not rare amongst girls, but rather it needs to be communicated with understanding. Some female dont think that way because the guy partner is already earning enough to pay half or even more. I am just fortunate enough to be able to meet someone from totally different background and put me through this test of going against the society norms. 

Is like if a person earns 10k per month and can afford to buy a Prada bag from the disposable income, why must they settle for a coach bag instead? If the guy partner is earning more or the same, some ladies would naturally feel that it is only right to do 50:50 or guys pay more. I admit i used to think that way when i was with my ex who earns 2k more than me per month. I seriously considered about the monetary part before i even agreed being his girlfriend cause i thought our future would be so difficult..

But because im able to meet my current husband that allows me to gain a total different perspective about being in a relationship and being in love. I know some girls would probably not bother to start a relationship with a guy of such background but i chose to go ahead because I was really in love with him and felt like a little princess being his girlfriend (not with the monetary gifts, but mainly the way we show our love and affection towards each other). Most importantly, our mentality are of the same frequency. Im not afraid to be myself when im with him or hang out with his friends, vice versa. Im happy that im able to see this guy for life..

But the truth is, even for guys or even girls who earn well, it doesnt mean they know how to save up for their future. Some may not even save a single cent only to struggle when they want to settle down. Some proritise expensive hobbies over their future. But mostly just dont communicate and may end up in ""since u guy then u pay more la"" kind of situation cause the girl didnt have that savings ready. The girl at times just expect the guy to be like a magician and show the money. But isnt wedding between two parties who really want to spend the lifetime together? Then all those financial burden should be shared and not one to have more or less (up to each couple's agreement). I know some guys who are really egoistic and say it doesnt make sense for girls to pay so he never wants to settle down when he dont have the money yet. Same - some girls say that they are the one leaving their roof to be with the guy so naturally the guy should pay for wedding.

I dont know what im trying to say and its difficult for me to explain how did the relationship between me and husband could have so much mutual understanding. I guess it's mainly: 

1) we prioritise our love and future over anything else. 

2) we communicate truthfully without hiding how we really feel. 

3) we listen to understand and not to reply. 

4) we plan our life financially as well (ps. We dont go for a lot of dates. Ie. We are not those ""my weekend is automatically with my partner"" kind of couple. We just meet for meals - those we are really hungry and want to eat and not eat for the sake of meeting kind. We just go for some free events to enjoy our time. And definitely, we spend money when necessary!)

5) dont ever feel envy about other people relationship. I have girlfriends who would call of meet up to compare engagement rings. I would give that a miss cause i dont think its worth comparing. Please dont ever take k drama as the norm. 

6) be contented that you found the one. Can you imagine yourself needing to leave him cause of money? If you cant, let go of such money quarrels and go with your feels. "

The reason I'm asking because I was quite fit all my life until the injury. I can't even remember how I started my fitness journey and I've never been trained professionally in that regard.

On my 3rd day of the training program, I started. Not sure if anyone is interested but will be staying close to these routines.

Every weekday morning 6am - 30mins casual pace jog
1,3,5 noons or evenings - Hit Chest, Squats and Back respectively with light weights and end with variations of core workouts.
Saturday or Sunday - casual swims

Would be staying clear of artificial proteins and sticking to cleaner food to see how my body reacts. Unfortunately, coke is still my love so that'll still be my diet plans haha.

1412,59974,"I am the #59974 author. 

Thank you all very much for your views. I hope I did not come across as salty - maybe I am just FOMO. I was just hoping for some good comments. It is great that there are people who are receiving help - and also sad that there are many left behind. 

Perhaps the reason why we see so many help groups which accentuate gender and racial lines is because the discrimination and harassment has created a common 'experience' which they all can learn to overcome together.  But I am also of the opinion that everyone (from other demographics) should be open and learn about these because it does take two or more hands to clap assuming minds are open. 

In the end, I feel in any power dynamic situation as long as one demographic has majority control there is probably going to be some form of inherent discrimination (which is pretty much clear in many places regardless of which gender or race is on top of that power dynamic). How do we - as a diverse hodge podge of gender race religion socioeconomic classes  - prevent the propagation of this phenomenon?

The thing is, she did not have to worry about missing the bus or train as the place was very near her home. Unlike her, I live very far from that place. Since then, she did not talk to me or text me for weeks despite me apologizing to her over text that I had to leave earlier. What makes me sad is that even though her friends left earlier than me, she wasn't angry with them. She even thanked them nicely for their accompany in our group chat  and I was not mentioned in the message. I feel very sad as I really regarded her as my best friend. I didn't mean to ruin her fun.

1424,59956,"Hello. I am the original author of #59956 - the one regarding splitting finances for wedding. Thank you for all the comments, i am flattered. 

Fun fact - my husband is younger than me by quite a bit (he is not xiao bai lian, dont worry). But that aside, I just want to say such mentality is not rare amongst girls, but rather it needs to be communicated with understanding. Some female dont think that way because the guy partner is already earning enough to pay half or even more. I am just fortunate enough to be able to meet someone from totally different background and put me through this test of going against the society norms. 

Is like if a person earns 10k per month and can afford to buy a Prada bag from the disposable income, why must they settle for a coach bag instead? If the guy partner is earning more or the same, some ladies would naturally feel that it is only right to do 50:50 or guys pay more. I admit i used to think that way when i was with my ex who earns 2k more than me per month. I seriously considered about the monetary part before i even agreed being his girlfriend cause i thought our future would be so difficult..

But because im able to meet my current husband that allows me to gain a total different perspective about being in a relationship and being in love. I know some girls would probably not bother to start a relationship with a guy of such background but i chose to go ahead because I was really in love with him and felt like a little princess being his girlfriend (not with the monetary gifts, but mainly the way we show our love and affection towards each other). Most importantly, our mentality are of the same frequency. Im not afraid to be myself when im with him or hang out with his friends, vice versa. Im happy that im able to see this guy for life..

But the truth is, even for guys or even girls who earn well, it doesnt mean they know how to save up for their future. Some may not even save a single cent only to struggle when they want to settle down. Some proritise expensive hobbies over their future. But mostly just dont communicate and may end up in ""since u guy then u pay more la"" kind of situation cause the girl didnt have that savings ready. The girl at times just expect the guy to be like a magician and show the money. But isnt wedding between two parties who really want to spend the lifetime together? Then all those financial burden should be shared and not one to have more or less (up to each couple's agreement). I know some guys who are really egoistic and say it doesnt make sense for girls to pay so he never wants to settle down when he dont have the money yet. Same - some girls say that they are the one leaving their roof to be with the guy so naturally the guy should pay for wedding.

I dont know what im trying to say and its difficult for me to explain how did the relationship between me and husband could have so much mutual understanding. I guess it's mainly: 

1) we prioritise our love and future over anything else. 

2) we communicate truthfully without hiding how we really feel. 

3) we listen to understand and not to reply. 

4) we plan our life financially as well (ps. We dont go for a lot of dates. Ie. We are not those ""my weekend is automatically with my partner"" kind of couple. We just meet for meals - those we are really hungry and want to eat and not eat for the sake of meeting kind. We just go for some free events to enjoy our time. And definitely, we spend money when necessary!)

5) dont ever feel envy about other people relationship. I have girlfriends who would call of meet up to compare engagement rings. I would give that a miss cause i dont think its worth comparing. Please dont ever take k drama as the norm. 

6) be contented that you found the one. Can you imagine yourself needing to leave him cause of money? If you cant, let go of such money quarrels and go with your feels. "

1433,59938,"Reply to Confession #58979

If you and your partner are roughly of the same age and earning the same income. I feel that it is a much better decision to make it fair 50:50 rather than getting the Male to pay more just because of social hierarchy. This is because your relationship will be a long term one and starting 'unfair' might become a source of conflict in the future which is something that you definitely want to avoid. But to be fair, I do not know of your situation and I do acknowledge some of the situation that might be alright to split 70:30 or 60:40.

1. Ask yourself this question, what are you going to use the rest of the money for when your partner pay more for the 'bigger items'? If it's personal items, assuming that male and female has the same basic necessities, aren't you just being unfair to him?
If you're using it under circumstances such as dental treatment, funding your little brother's school, etc (case on case basis) then you might want to talk to your partner to a certain agreement, but do be honest and remember that not all reason are actually 'valid'. Example is if you say you are funding your parents vacation, he also have parents and the arrangement will become unfair to his parents. So... the point is, really think through what are you going to use the rest of the money for before bringing this up to an 'unbalanced' arrangement.

2. What's the dynamic of your 'smaller items' payment? If it's all based on 50:50, I don't see why you should push the bigger items to other ratio. But if you have the tendency to pay for smaller items, let's say you cover electricity bill, dinner  etc. Then maybe it's actually alright because in the end it will be approximately 50:50 for what is covered by both of you~ 

3. If the guy is really okay with any arrangement, who am I to say? What I want to say though, a lot of couples went through this phase when the guys would not mind paying more for the girls and again, consider what will happen in the future. Based on your dynamics, can it be the reason for a crack in your future relationship?

Do take note that they're my opinion and I might miss some other possible cases. In the end, it really depends on you and your partner. I wish you all the best in your relationship~"

Being angsty, he then went on jam braking the bus and open the door for like a second for passengers to unload at the next stop. Obviously there are students who did not managed to get down so they shouted for the driver to stop. The driver then stopped, opened the for for another 1 second, closed the door and drive. There were again students who have yet to go down. So the shouting ensued and the door opened again. This is absolutely ridiculous. I hope authorities can look into this matter. Thank you."

On my 3rd day of the training program, I started. Not sure if anyone is interested but will be staying close to these routines.

Every weekday morning 6am - 30mins casual pace jog
1,3,5 noons or evenings - Hit Chest, Squats and Back respectively with light weights and end with variations of core workouts.
Saturday or Sunday - casual swims

Would be staying clear of artificial proteins and sticking to cleaner food to see how my body reacts. Unfortunately, coke is still my love so that'll still be my diet plans haha.

From starting small talks to actual conversations, from talking about having supper to having actual suppers. Eventually we became, or at least I regarded you as, close friends. 

Though we didn’t actually go out a lot, those supper did the trick. Eventually I managed to ask you out, to this festival I’ll never forget. Ever since then, I realised that, I’ve fallen in love with you. It some how feels painful as I knew it was unrequited love, yet stubborn me didn’t want to acknowledge it because I knew that my fragile heart couldn’t take it. 

Days passed by, we had countless of talkative nights, sharing everything and every problems under the moonlight. I tried to think of you as just another Friend but it was getting overly awkward for me. I knew from the beginning that, I’d fall in love with you someday.

1456,59897,"Dear guys out there, I am in need of serious advice.

I am currently 30, and I met a guy who works as a financial advisor in his mid 30s, which I assumed he should be either 37 or 38 this year. Basically, I am his client, and we met a few months back.

We started off just purely business. One day when we were scheduled to meet, something happened at home, so I had to reschedule the meeting. And that lead us to a conversation. I am actually kind of confused by the signals he sent because I know I started falling for him (a few months later). Please correct me if I am wrong.

1. Why would someone spend time chatting with a client? Its like almost everyday. This continued for some time, then we stopped messaging daily, and I try not to send him messages. Even now, he still send me messages every few days to check on my life.

2. We go out on random dinner/lunch dates. We just set a date to exercise together.

3. One night I told him I missed him, and he said it will be irrational if he missed me. It was quite late that night and he drove to my place and we hang out the whole night with some heart to heart talk. He said he is still single because he didn't want commitment.

4. When something happened at my home, he came over, and sent me to places (which kind of warm my heart)

5. He stays alone. He doesn't invite me to his place, but he self invited himself to my place by saying ""occasionally he can stay over at my place if my family is not around"". 

I mean, I try to be rational and not think too much into it or read between the lines, but his actions are kind of confusing to me. I know I am definitely interested in him, and I feel he that he is too. But he says he doesn't want commitment, and if that is so, why does he still keep sending mixed signals? Should I ask him upfront what he wants?

I couldn't be waiting infinitely if he doesn't want to commit right? Even though on many levels, we definitely click well. I certainly won't mind spending time to get to know each other better at this stage if he has feelings. I feel that the feeling is both mutual, just that I am unsure how to proceed from here.

We are both introverts hence our friendship development is slow but at a comfortable pace. Though we knew each other for years, it's only last year we started to have more contact with each other and I developed feelings for him along the way. Right now, we have opened up to each other more through texts, talking about what we are looking for in relationships, what we want our future to be, our current lives etc. Things go deep at times. Of course we do have casual conversations I do have a feeling that both of us enjoy these exchanges of texts, not too frequent but at a comfortable frequency of once or twice every week.

1468,59880,"I took my CS3230 exam at the same time, same hall as the CS2040 exam. Even I could see how badly the exam was set because the prof kept announcing changes every 20 minutes. It was annoying for me to sit through that noise while trying to concentrate, but it must have been even harder for you guys taking CS2040 to concentrate too.

Your Prof has been doing that for quite a few years, actually. Last time when I was taking another module under him 2 years ago, he would scream across the exam hall if he finds anyone writing after the exam ended. Yeah it's wrong to keep writing after the exam. But, if you're the invigilator, you should just call them out with a normal voice and write their number down. No need to scream at them when there are other students taking longer exams in the same hall. Not to mention the paper was full of errors at that time as well.

I know there are lots of idealists here saying ""ohh, you should raise these issues directly to the profs not whine here on whispers"" but let me tell you this - he hasn't changed. For 2 years. You don't think my batch wrote comments to him in the module review? I know at least I did. But some people never change.

Just remember that there are more good profs in soc than bad profs. And if you're taking 2040 you're likely to be y2 or y1 so also keep this in mind - its really hard to get things changed in this faculty so you sometimes just have to suck it up when you encounter bad profs. And the faculty office won't do much for you to improve that. Spend more time thinking about the good profs... Haha. "
1469,59879,"I was the one who wrote the original confession #59879 regarding the debate which sparked on the 60/70-40/30 instead of 50-50 with my fiancé. Thank you for the advice and input from the helpful ones - Eventually, we agreed on a 60-40 arrangement for the wedding/house because backstory is, I have a car which I’m paying by myself (not sharing the loan with him because I needed it for my work) and supporting my parents too while he isn’t. Yes, car is a big ticket item but he is working in an office job so it doesn’t seem fair he chip in for it, because we only use it over weekends for dates. Guess I missed those out in my previous confession, my output is definitely more even though we’re earning the same range. Anyway apart from the above, I find it so hard to save each month because of the commitments! Life’s tough.

Let’s end the fwb issue once and for all!!! Girls can do whatever they want and sleep with whoever they want!!

But if they get unwanted pregnancy, abortion, emotional manipulation, used by men etc, they deserve absolutely NO sympathy AT ALL since they bring everything upon themselves and they are fully aware of the risk they are putting themselves in. 

No need to be white knight because nobody will appreciate you. The girls will just smear you into a busybody bigot patriarch controlling their sexuality. As the Chinese saying goes 不见棺材不掉泪，let them learn it the hard way (no pun intended)!! "
1472,59875,"CS2030 might not be the perfect module, but SoC certainly shouldn't lower the bar just because of the difficulty. We should continue to build a world class curriculum known for rigor. If anything, it should be more enriching or difficult. For:

1. New CS students. If CS2030 is too hard for you right now, it is time to evaluate whether CS is for you or not. If you really like CS but have weak fundamentals, work on them because things should only get tougher.

2. IS/BA students who are forced to take CS2030. You might think that CS2030 is a ""CS"" course and it is unfair that IS students need to take on the same rigor. But I've seen too many IS students selling themselves in the job market that they know both CS and business. If you want to be treated like one (paid like one), then act like one and do it well.

3. Students who are taking CS as a minor or major. Yes, this is how CS is. I still recommend that you try your best to do it well. Dont lament that you lack fundamentals unlike CS students because most CS students here only took CS1101S before taking CS2030 and CS1010S is should be enough."
1473,59872,"Need some advice guys.

I’ve been working for about 2.5 years now. After graduating, I joined a graduate programme in Finance with a large global MNC. Benefits were good there, and the organizational culture was great. People were genuinely nice and I got on very well with almost everyone I worked with. Work was mostly comprised of classroom learnings and small group projects with my fellow graduate trainees as well as overseas rotation stints. It got pretty boring because I didn’t really do anything value-added until my final overseas rotation when I got really hands-on with budgeting and Business Intelligence. People liked me because I was really good with automation of work through programming, and was doing really well, I was noticed by my mentors and the senior managers throughout the company. Because of this, the company decided to send me to a remote country with limited internet connectivity in a permanent role as a Data Analyst, to launch the business there. I didn’t want to go, plus the role was not even in Finance or FP&A related. So when another large firm headhunted me, I jumped at the opportunity without thinking.

It turned out to be a mistake. The new role (based in Singapore) was so routine even though it was FP&A. I hardly needed to analyse anything, it was more of a reporting role, and systems were so limited in capabilities that it created extra work. Company was toxic in culture, my boss didn’t mentor me the same way my previous boss did, and I was left to figure things out myself. Although my learning curve was steep, I was sickened to the gut with the stupidity of the business philosophy (that of extreme cost cutting, with no focus on topline revenue growth). People were not as receptive towards improvement or automation, and I was told not to rock the boat. So 6 months in, I resigned.

It took me a couple of months to find another job, being a bit more selective this time. I’m currently 3 weeks into my next role, a commercial business partner in a growing start up. The role is fulfilling, and I do a lot more financial modelling work (which I love). Everything is great here, except one downside: my boss.

This guy came from an investment banking background, and is super demanding. He even explicitly said that if I’m not prepared to work overnight and on weekends, then this role is not for me. I’m always kept on my toes and neglecting family and friends just to keep up with his expectations. He sends chaser emails and whatsapp texts all through the day. I work 14 hours a day, and too afraid to even break for lunch. I guess I am struck with so much fear because this job is important to me (I cannot do another short term tenure again). 3 weeks in and I am exhausted, my heart beats so fast from the intensity and pace of my boss. 2 weeks ago I couldn’t deliver 1 forecast projection and he lashed out via an angsty email. So I squeezed more hours to deliver the week after and yet he was less than impressed. With so much to catch up on the new business and being overwhelmed with information and deadlines, I really don’t know how long I can last. I will still try my best, but I have been doing so since I joined. Any advice on what I should do? Change my mentality or something?"
1474,59871,"I completely agree with all the posts about cs2030 workload. I'm also someone who did well for 1010 and really enjoyed it. However, I find myself spending most of my time on 2030 this sem, what with all the labs (they even released one during recess week??) and the individual project. Honestly the lecutre slides and teaching for the first semester was a complete mess and only made learning things harder. This mod is making this sem super stressful for me, and as much as I still have an interest in coding (I'm not a CS student) this has definitely been a rather shitty experience."

1479,59863,"I read that the median grade for Harvard graduates is an A-. I don't know about how others think but I think NUS and their bell curve seems like a pretty shitty deal. While  NUS wants to keep its grades and degree valuable, colleges such as HYP seems to have grade inflation and still are wonderful. Companies all want and prefer FCH so isn't it not the duty of NUS to give out more? 

I think that forcing students into a bell curve isn't good at all as it makes everyone more competitive and less collaborative. College is a place to learn, but ends up with people who just try to game the system of trying to get the grades while forgetting what they learn the following sem. Professors should set reasonable papers instead of making the paper too easy or hard and then use the bell curve as it doesn't do anyone any good.

1480,59862,"Hi I really wish you could post this cause I feel really bad I need this out of my mind, here goes!

Yesterday was NUS' open house and like everyone, I was eager to check out the various accommodations that NUS could offer to make school life more vibrant.
So my friend and I decided to sign up for a tour around Raffles Hall mainly because it was the only hall offering tours on that day.

After the tour, we had ice cream, drinks, popcorns, cotton candy which was really awesome and I really thank them for putting in so much effort!!!

So I had a drink in my hand (some sparkling drink which was really refreshing ) but I just finished drinking it and was waiting for the shuttle bus to ferry us back to UTown.

There was a guy who seemed really awkward, as he just sheepishly stood there when a bunch of commitee members of Raffles Hall walked passed him. After a while, he approached us as we were still waiting for the bus. We found out that he was also part of the committee member and he was a year 3 student who transferred from Mechanical Engineering back in Year 1 to Data Analytics.

From the conversation, I could tell that he was really trying his best to be proactive and outspoken even though I could sense he was really uncomfortable. I REALLY applaud his willingness to step out of his comfort zone to interact with total strangers i.e. me and my friend.

Afterwhich I casually said that the weather was so hot and asked if I could have another drink. He gladly took the glass bottle from my hand and without hesitation said he will get me another. (It was actually quite a distance from where I was to get the drink)

Here comes the terrible part.

While he went to get me a drink, our bus came! I tried to walk really slowly to the bus hoping he would appear soon. After a while, he did appear with the bottle in his hand. The distance from where he was and where the bus was located was pretty far. Unfortunately, I was already halfway up the bus when I spotted him. Despite the fact that he wouldn't have caught me, he still waved his hands so vigourously at me and ran towards the bus. Yeah the bus left subsequently, and he stood there awkwardly with the newly opened bottle of drink.

I could have waited for him to come but there were others on the bus too and I didn't want to keep them waiting.

I FELT SO BAD!

I just want to point out that on my part, I am really sorry and I should have waited for him and not leave him. If he is reading this and I really hope he is, please don't be discouraged and don't let this misunderstanding affect you. I really hope that you will still have the courage to approach people to make friends with them even though I know how hard it may feel. You have gone the extra mile and your kindness will be deeply appreciated!!"
1481,59861,Has anyone tried staying on campus (specifically halls) from Y3 onwards? How is it like? I want to do something different with my life before I graduate.
1482,59860,"You know what's weird? Like I recall Open Day being met with cynicism from my peers being ""omg just wait till you see the REAL NUS!!!"". But... as a Year 4, I honestly will miss my time in NUS. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones, but these past 4 years have been life-changing. Perhaps it is a rare situation, as I was fortunate enough to stay on campus, and learned/changed enough to change my career path completely and switch faculties. Having experiences that changed my spiritual outlook also helped to resolve some of the trauma I bottled in for the longest time.

It feels weird, since it is week 8, and some of my juniors are waiting for the sem to end amidst mid-terms (my CAP died a long time ago, so no stress there). But there's a tinge of sadness with it. Even though I've cried a good bunch these past 4 years but it has taught me so much as well. Thanks NUS, even though I haven't left you, just the thought of this chapter of my life coming to an end is already making me emotional again. 

In short, really appreciate this time. Those who have been through internships, or already have working experience, trust me - like, projects may seem horrible, but this period of time is something you will never get back. Enjoy it for what it is, even as impossible as it may seem.

1490,59850,"Dear #59730, with regards to your question on how to start a relationship, I have some legit advice for you. 

Step 1: Find someone you like. You can download dating apps, join interest groups or simply stalk people on fb/ig.

*Tip: Avoid people who are obviously out of your league and the delusional/stuck-up ones who think they are too good for everyone*

Step 2: Find something you like about yourself. If you can't even find it then sadly you cannot expect anyone else to like you. 

Step 3: Show off the things you like about yourself e.g. if you like your body, you can wear clothes that accentuate your body. If you like your face, you're most likely a narcissist and you probably shouldn't date anyone. 

Step 4: Befriend the person you like. 

Example:
You saw a random cute girl on fb. You drop her a message e.g. ""Hey, you look pretty, where you from?""
P.S. This only works if you are not ugly.

Step 5: Talk to the person you like on a regular basis. Keep it casual. Mai kanchiong.

Step 6: Ask the person you like if she would like to go out with you. 

First impression counts. 
Put on your best outfit, choose somewhere classy, recce the place beforehand, get her a bouquet of flowers, hold the door for her, etc. 

Expected total damage = $100-200. 

*Tip: the higher the damage, the higher the probability of a second date*

Step 7: Continue to ask the person you like to hang out on a regular basis. This should last a few weeks or months. So get ready to find a part-time job to cover the expenses. 

Step 8: Plan a romantic date for the person you like and ask her to be your gf. 

Expected total damage = your salary for the entire month.  


tl;dr: How to start a relationship? -> Be rich.

There's a catch. The reason that I'm so comfortable being together with him because he shared with me that he's looking for a gf that has the same religion with him. And since I don't follow that religion, I felt reassured that I was out of his dating pool. Hence, i have always truly treated him as a friend and nothing else, despite my other friends occasional teasing of us being a couple.

However, i wonder why, but something changed. It feels as if suddenly, he no longer puts in any effort in our friendship anymore. He no longer jios me out for lunch and we no longer pm each other. It's a gradual process since I still made an effort to pm him and ask him how are his deadlines etc. But his replies, from one to two sentences, becomes single word replies.

During y2, my friend and I were doing group project with another fellow. That fellow is a control freak and would try to micro-manage the 2 of us. So my friend and I decided to mess things up (our cap is too cui anyways).

Anyways, the project consisted of a presentation and a report. While he will try to micromanage us, we will always give him utter rubbish. Like copy paragraphs directly from wikipedia or random links from google search and send to him for ""Review"". When he force us to accept his suggestion and we said okay but just do it completely wrong. Example: he wanted us to find good images that can be used for the presentation, we had 1 or 2 images that seems to fit the topic while the rest were nonsense from random google search. 

I still remembered sending him a picture of a cat and said that it would fit our presentation. He replied, asking if we are messing with him. I told him it looked cute and proceeded to send him a few more puss in boots. 

Towards the end, he was pissed mad and wanted to report us to the prof. We toned down a little while starting to mess with the slides (hidden sound clips that plays during slide show). Can you imagine giving presentation with random sound effect like ""That's right"", ""Way to go"" or even an ""Aw yeah!!"" added as you made your points.

Stop searching for the perfect one thinking this person is going to come into your life being they're everything you've ever wanted and you'll never have issues with each other. Truth is, it won't. You need to fight for things. You choose who you want to struggle with. If you want it to last, you have to decide that you want it to. We still pisses each other off, we fight (a lot) but productively. And she has made me into my better-self.The more you love each other, the more you have to work at it. The only people who are worth everything are the ones who care and are there for you in your trying times. Don't let go of the greatest people in your life. "

1513,59803,"I'll be honest. I kept my virginity all the way till I was 25. I have a super high sex drive - I literally don't know another guy or girl whose sex drive is higher than mine. So any of you could guess how damn hard I fought to keep it for so long.

Long story short, something snapped, I broke up. And this was what I needed to get over that rough patch. Losing my virginity. After all, I was in a place where I had nothing left to lose, and nothing else to abuse. So abuse sex I did.

So I hooked up. With the first girl I could find willing to do it. She was a whole lot more experienced than I was. But honestly, there were so many of my expectations which were broken that night. About sex.

The first was that it would feel wonderful. Honestly, it's overrated. Sex is a shit ton of hard work, and if I may be honest while I've learnt ways to make sex feel really great, and while it could sometimes make me convulse in pleasure, I'd honestly trade it for other pleasurable things any day. Pleasurable things like Wagyu beef, wasabi, or matcha ice cream. Those provide almost all the pleasure, with none of the hard work. And there are some days with sex where you put in all of the hard work and you get little to none of the satisfaction. That never happens with Wagyu, Wasabi, or Matcha ice cream. All of the three items give predictable highs, with none of the work put in.

The second was that something would change about me after my first time. I mean for so long we were taught we should keep our first time for someone special. That it would be like unwrapping a gift after marriage. Which was honestly bullshit. After taking my virginity, the girl I was with told me ""congrats. You're a man now."" I kept mum. Because the only thought going through my head was ""Yeah right. I don't feel like anything has changed at all.""

Also, for those of you who might say ""it didn't feel that good cuz it wasn't with someone you loved""........well. so I took the virginity of my ex-gf. I loved her. Thing is, despite that, sex with her had always been meh.

But well, there are people who are particular about keeping sex for the first time. Or people who view me differently after knowing I had sex. And I think they're just ridiculous. Apart from the fact that I know what to do to make a girl feel good, and I've got practical experience (rather than just theoratical), nothing has actually changed about me at all."
1514,59802,"I’m really disgusted by my friend and I want to seek NUSWhispers’s opinion on whether I’m overreacting. 

Personally I think fwb is wrong but I never ever judge or criticized others for having fwb. So basically the incident goes like this: 

I have this female friend who has fwb. Since protection is not 100% foolproof, she somehow unluckily got pregnant. Her fwb didn’t  want to take responsibility and ran away. She got no one to turn to (she claimed her parents would kill her if they know what she did) and came to me for help. She cried so pitifully that afternoon and begged me to save her. I advised her to call hotlines and social worker etc but she didnt want. She cried and cried threatened to killed herself if I don’t help. 

Upon seeing that she was so mentally unstable, I sympathized with her and help her with the abortion process all the way from finding a legit doctor to signing medical papers. Trust me, it’s a dam nightmarish, troublesome and embarrassing ordeal, especially since I’m not even the guy who impregnated her. 

Now, this is the key part. Lo and behold, after everything was settled, now she is having fwb again just 3 months after the incident. I was baffled and criticized her for not learning from her lesson. To my disbelief, she said that she learnt her lesson. The lesson is to use more protections during sex. Casual sex is ok and I have no rights to dictate her body with my traditional viewpoint. 

Oh my goodness.. I’m utterly disgusted and disdained at her. I hate to use this word but h*e is the only word I can think of to describe how I feel. Is this normal or am I really overreacting? "
1515,59801,"I wanted to move on very long, but after what #59073 has written, it evoked my memories once more. TLDR, I am just a jerk who would like to thank someone who once appeared in my life and taught me to be a better person.

Hi F, I am not sure if you would be reading this, since I got to know you while I was exchanging and you probably wouldn't follow this page. I was not looking for a relationship prior to this and most of my encounters with other girls ended after a few lukewarm exchanges, until you showed up. 

Despite my carefree personality, I am a totally different person when it comes to work. Literally no smiles, dull and often the epitome of looking resentful. It was only I met you when I told myself I will be ready to settle and be less carefree, even if it means my lifestyle would change and I might have to relocate. Through my exchanges with you, I got to know you better. 

Through some misunderstanding, we drifted apart. I remember you for calling me over-sensitive when I try to break the ice with you once more. And I broke your trust by telling things that you confided in me because you trusted me. I am sorry for breaking that trust. It was you who thought me what is trivial to me may be important to someone else and it could well be a secret that is not meant for others to know, not even our mutual close friends. Subsequently another round of argument because of other things made me resolute that our friendship was gone, let alone for that slight possibility of romance which might have developed. 

You warmed up to me after that, all of a sudden. I remember I wasn't responding to the hints you made, repeatedly the whole night while we were out wth our friends. It must have been hard and embarrass for you to give so many hints and it's so obvious that our friends around us would have gotten it. Even after that night, you tried to talk to me, but I started drawing boundaries - replying less frequently, deciding to hang out lesser with you and probably you could feel that I wasn't as warm as I was to you prior to that. You continued to follow my IG stories and my posts and I knew that. I just don't know how to approach you and what were you after. I was just so sure that I might not be the one for you after all and our interactions just went to as good as zero.

Now that I am back home and whenever I play truth or dare, or when I have downed some alcohol, I will try to tell myself to not share with anyone this encounter. There are just too many ifs in the process. What if I did not share out what turned out to be your guarded secret? What if we warmed up to each other at the same time? What if I actually come and speak to you despite whatever that happened? 

The worst part is just when I thought I have put behind this incident, I realised I didn't. Whenever I started to HTHT, whenever I drink, I will be regretting over my mistakes. I just couldn't find anyone that would made me change myself for her again. I think that I only have myself to blame ultimately. Yes, I am a jerk, an egoistic man, behind a front that appears mature.

I heard from my friend that you have started seeing someone. I hope that the person will treat you better than any of the guys you had. I just hope that the next time we meet again, we will be smiling at each other and we could become closer friends, if I may. 

Thank you for reading such a long post. I am not sure if this is what they meant by the first love, since we never really started. Btw F, thank you for enabling me to grow up and to be more sensitive to someone else's needs and wants. And for others out there, you just have to talk to the other person if you really want answers to your questions. Don't be a jerk like I once was.

Although my grades were fairly decent (2:1 in Engineering), I found myself not being employable for most govt jobs due to my 'U' grade for GP. Knowing that the iron bowl is out of the picture, I started bulk applying, attending interviews after interviews. Eventually, after more than 50 applications, I finally got a role which paid $3K/month.

This was slightly below my expectation of $4K, a threshold I thought I should have been getting given what I heard from my peers who got offers from various places. I thought and deliberated for quite a while - whether to continue in my search or to just accept the offer.

Eventually, I decided to take up the offer. I thought to myself to focus on what I have and to make the best out of it, even though there were occasions when I felt shortchanged compared to my batch-mates. Half a year in, I chanced upon an opportunity in another company for >2x the salary I was drawing. A combination of the projects I worked on and a good referral from my previous manager who recognized my efforts landed me the job.

Fast forward a year later, I was drawing >$8K/month. 

I think what I am trying to bring across is 1) earning >$6K within 1 year of graduation is not impossible for non-comp majors, 2) do not be disheartened when you see yourself starting behind your peers, and 3) people do and will recognize your hard work and it will come back to you.

1533,59770,"Hey #59747, I can totally relate to what you're going through. My bf is also a super ambitious guy who talked about his internship all the time. I met him when we were both doing part-time f&b. He was waiting to be enlisted into NS while I was studying at a polytechnic. 

During his army days, things were simple. We both stay in the west so during his BMT, we would take the train from Jurong East to Pasir Ris when he book in and we would spend the long journey talking about his army life. When he book out, I would wait for him at Pasir Ris and we would also spend the journey home talking about his army life. It was super boring listening to him talk about the same army stuff over and over but I really appreciated the fact that he was willing to share his life with me despite being so tired and stressed out by all the army stuff. 

Fast forward to his uni days, I graduated from poly and found a marketing assistant job while he started doing all sorts of internships like summer, winter, part-time internships and even took an LOA to do an internship. Basically, he worked throughout his entire uni life. Throughout the whole course of his uni life, we would meet up after work every day and talk about his school and internship during meals. Again, I listened to him talk about the same school and internship stuff over and over until I can memorise all his classmates and colleagues' names. But I felt happy that I could share his burden by listening to his struggles and difficulties faced at school and work. 

Fast forward to today, he now works at a big firm that pays him 4 times of what I earn. He's constantly busy with work and we could only meet once a week. But whenever we meet up, all he talks about is still work and work. Nevertheless, I'm happy that he still finds time to call me everyday. 

Throughout our relationship, I had my doubts and insecurities. I used to feel very inadequate and worry that he would leave me for someone better. Afterall, I'm just an average poly grad while he's a FCH from a local uni. Whenever I ask him if he would leave me for those smart and pretty girls out there, he would always say that what he's looking for is not a smart and pretty gf but a kind and loving gf. 

So, don't worry that you're not good enough for your partner. Not every guy wants someone as capable as them. Sometimes, what a guy wants is just someone who would support him and be there for him. "

1537,59759,"This has been on my mind, but I wasn’t sure if it was worth a post or rant. Until some complaints about people not receiving text msg till few days later came about. 

Does anyone feels e same way 
It irks me when people dun activate blue tick on their WhatsApp. And it is even worst if you dun bother replying or give super late reply few days later 

I’m totally fine if you read my msg on e same day but reply few days later and I would know cause blue tick will tell me that you have read it 

But when e contacts dun activate e blueticks and dun reply I’m like how do I know if e msg has been send and received. Are u still there or has sth happen 

Which brings me to the next point 
The reason why people dun activate blue ticks is because people in general expect their friend to reply instantly after all we live in e age of instant gratification and how long does it take to reply to a text msg right? 

But we forget get the world doesn’t revolve around us and our friends/ gf/bf/ best friend does not need to reply us instantly if they think e matter can wait. 

I know of friends whose partner read their text on the same day but reply four to 5 days later. 

But thanks to blue tick tech at least e sender has known tt e msg has been read. 

Cause there are people out there who just dun like to use their phone tt much. 

So to confessor #59720. Since ur bf doesn’t reply instantly to his friends too it does shows tt he dun like to reply instantly tt often. But if he still shows up and meeting and spend time with you tt good 

So ask yourself if this really bothers u tt much to e extend of breaking up, what are some compromise tt you guys can come up with. 

Cause I honestly feel it is a trival but important issue and if you guys dun communicate about it how are u guys doing to stay together through other issues and difficulties faced. 

Lack of communication is one of the reason why breakups happen. But what does a evergreen  person in my 20s know."

The disgusting thing is that the typical replies are always a bunch of trolls asking for breakups, dumping their partner, 'he or she is not worth your time', 'better off without him/her'. Not pointing names because thats besides the point.

I mean cmon, in our parents good ol days era, when relationships break down, they communicate, mediate and fix them. Stop treating your relationship as if you're waiting to hop on the next ship then swings by.

1546,59747,"Hey #59747, I can totally relate to what you're going through. My bf is also a super ambitious guy who talked about his internship all the time. I met him when we were both doing part-time f&b. He was waiting to be enlisted into NS while I was studying at a polytechnic. 

During his army days, things were simple. We both stay in the west so during his BMT, we would take the train from Jurong East to Pasir Ris when he book in and we would spend the long journey talking about his army life. When he book out, I would wait for him at Pasir Ris and we would also spend the journey home talking about his army life. It was super boring listening to him talk about the same army stuff over and over but I really appreciated the fact that he was willing to share his life with me despite being so tired and stressed out by all the army stuff. 

Fast forward to his uni days, I graduated from poly and found a marketing assistant job while he started doing all sorts of internships like summer, winter, part-time internships and even took an LOA to do an internship. Basically, he worked throughout his entire uni life. Throughout the whole course of his uni life, we would meet up after work every day and talk about his school and internship during meals. Again, I listened to him talk about the same school and internship stuff over and over until I can memorise all his classmates and colleagues' names. But I felt happy that I could share his burden by listening to his struggles and difficulties faced at school and work. 

Fast forward to today, he now works at a big firm that pays him 4 times of what I earn. He's constantly busy with work and we could only meet once a week. But whenever we meet up, all he talks about is still work and work. Nevertheless, I'm happy that he still finds time to call me everyday. 

Throughout our relationship, I had my doubts and insecurities. I used to feel very inadequate and worry that he would leave me for someone better. Afterall, I'm just an average poly grad while he's a FCH from a local uni. Whenever I ask him if he would leave me for those smart and pretty girls out there, he would always say that what he's looking for is not a smart and pretty gf but a kind and loving gf. 

So, don't worry that you're not good enough for your partner. Not every guy wants someone as capable as them. Sometimes, what a guy wants is just someone who would support him and be there for him. "
1547,59746,"I come from a broken family and I have attachment issues. My own parents broke up when I was an infant - they also took their frustration at life out on me (and I won't get into the details of that here). 

My relationships have not worked out well since I am unable to trust people or become close to them. People are asking me when I am going to get married since I am in my late 20s now. If I were to get married, that would not only be a disaster for me, but it will also be a disaster for my future spouse, and any future children that I may have - since they will suffer from my lack of emotional availability. Why pressure someone to get married when that person knows it will not be suitable for them?

When people read this, they will probably think: ""Well, don't get married then."" Except that is not straightforward in a society where unmarried people are marginalised."

The longer we've been together, the more I wonder what she saw in me. It makes me really insecure, and affects my self esteem. She seems to have noticed this and she is constantly reassuring her love for me.

Don't be mistaken, I love her a lot, and I'm quite certain she loves me too (she consistently cooks for me, buy me gifts, is fairly clingy etc, which I do reciproate). I definitely want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just need advice on how to manage all these negativity I have."
1554,59731,"Regarding the smart girl saga, I just wanna say no guy likes girls who are smarter than them. Guys like to have face and ego. We like to be dominant and have power. Thus we only like girls who are more vulnerable, weaker and less smart so that we can protect them and exert masculinity. 

It is unfair to criticize guys to have inferiority complex if they don’t like smart girl because it’s hard-wired in male’s brain through thousands of years of evolutionary psychology. 

Yes, we can reason and rationalize it out but that indignant feeling shaped by thousands of years of evo psychology cannot be quenched merely by conscious reasoning and rationalization. Thus, instead of trying to fight back and suppress this feeling, we just choose not to entertain girls smarter than us. 

That’s why guys who feel they are not dominant in a marriage will cheat and find power outside of marriage, a classic case is what happened in Crazy Rich Asian movie. 

In this modern world where gender equality is hailed as the gold standard, the power difference between male and female is getting smaller. Girls.. You can choose to be successful and powerful all you want, just remember to find some guy even better than you. Generally, guys (Asian guys at least) prefer more obedient and submissive girls to be life long partner. 

And this is not about ego, it is about the core of what male and masculinity constitutes. Ask any guy, who like to be henpecked by a girl... Any normal guy will tell you no way! "
1555,59730,"Dear #59730, with regards to your question on how to start a relationship, I have some legit advice for you. 

Step 1: Find someone you like. You can download dating apps, join interest groups or simply stalk people on fb/ig.

*Tip: Avoid people who are obviously out of your league and the delusional/stuck-up ones who think they are too good for everyone*

Step 2: Find something you like about yourself. If you can't even find it then sadly you cannot expect anyone else to like you. 

Step 3: Show off the things you like about yourself e.g. if you like your body, you can wear clothes that accentuate your body. If you like your face, you're most likely a narcissist and you probably shouldn't date anyone. 

Step 4: Befriend the person you like. 

Example:
You saw a random cute girl on fb. You drop her a message e.g. ""Hey, you look pretty, where you from?""
P.S. This only works if you are not ugly.

Step 5: Talk to the person you like on a regular basis. Keep it casual. Mai kanchiong.

Step 6: Ask the person you like if she would like to go out with you. 

First impression counts. 
Put on your best outfit, choose somewhere classy, recce the place beforehand, get her a bouquet of flowers, hold the door for her, etc. 

Expected total damage = $100-200. 

*Tip: the higher the damage, the higher the probability of a second date*

Step 7: Continue to ask the person you like to hang out on a regular basis. This should last a few weeks or months. So get ready to find a part-time job to cover the expenses. 

Step 8: Plan a romantic date for the person you like and ask her to be your gf. 

Expected total damage = your salary for the entire month.  


tl;dr: How to start a relationship? -> Be rich.

1556,59729,"Dear #59684, unlike those people who commented on your post, I'm not here to judge or condemn you. 

You mentioned that you have a gf and got on tinder recently. Have you thought about why you did this? Is it because you were bored or you were trying to find someone new? If you were just bored, you can try to develop new interests and hobbies. If you were looking for a potential partner, you could first evaluate your current relationship i.e. are you happy with your current partner? do you see a future with her? If you're happy and do envision a future with her, I would advise you to stop talking to that new girl before it starts to affect your relationship with your current partner.  

Yes, that new girl may seem very interesting to you. But that could be due to the very fact that you have known her for only 2 weeks. You mentioned that you're not sure if you like her or are infatuated with her. I think it's very easy to 'like' someone, especially if that person is nice and attractive. Based on my own experience, I think infatuations usually don't last. They are merely feelings that fade away as time passes. Afterall, as humans, we are often drawn to new things and then lose interest as the 'newness' wears off.

It's also easy to feel like you've known someone for a long time if you two share a lot of similarities. To be honest, I've met a lot of people whom I felt a great sense of closeness towards because we shared the same thinking and values. Although it certainly felt good to meet such people, it doesn't mean we would be compatible in the long run. 

You also mentioned that you got physical with that new girl but didn't move onto the bed. Are you trying to say you have not cheated? Everyone has a different definition when it comes to cheating. Some people may feel that cheating means seeing two person at the same time. Some may feel that cheating means having sex with someone other than your sexual partner. It doesn't matter what other people think. It doesn't matter what your definition is. Most importantly, you have to ask yourself if you want to continue to stay in your current relationship. 

The length of a relationship may not be the best gauge of the quality of a relationship. But I think 5 years is quite a good amount of time to get to know someone well. Throughout these 5 years, I'm sure there were ups and downs and you should be able to see if you partner would be a good match in the long run. If you don't see her as a good match, you should end things with her as soon as you can. Then you can take your time to get to know the new girl before taking it to the next level. All the best.

1560,59723,"To everyone currently in an abusive relationship, 

I just want to share my personal opinions and experiences on this issue.


I know, easier said than done. I've been there before, and it took me a long time before even realizing and admitting that I was in a toxic, unhealthy and emotionally (sometimes verbally) abusive relationship. Coming to terms with this was probably harder than getting over the actual person because you must accept that you're the victim, that you've been hurt, that the person you loved with your entire heart and whom you gave all you could ever give reciprocated only with apathy, nonchalance and malice - whether intended or not.


I could never meet or talk to any of my other friends that he didn't like (which was almost all of those from the opposite sex). My messages are raided regularly for 'spot-checking', any time past 10 pm if I'm out is considered outrageously late. If I confronted him on returning home at 4 am, I was dismissed as obnoxious and controlling. Not meeting him because I'm really busy with school is being 'unreasonable'. Asking him to quit his bad habits (like fatally bad - smoking) was quickly condemned as 'selfish' and 'intolerant'. Its the famous excuse: ""if you love me, you should accept WHOLLY for who I am"". Intensive interrogation over hours of phone calls was common.


When I told him about my personal troubles, it was met with aloofness or how I was being 'too negative'. He told me to see a psychiatrist instead of transferring my burdens onto him (which I did went to see a counselor instead later on). Not wanting to show affection to him in public meant that 'I did not love him enough'. He was never there for me when I was sick even though I cooked porridge/noodles/herbal teas for him and sponged him with ice water when he came down with fevers. 


One time we were in the middle of a fight while walking and he saw his ex. He abruptly put one hand over my shoulder as we approached her, and only put it down when we were a safe distance away. That's the kind of person he is.


Eventually he got exhausted or bored of the constant arguments we had, the extended cold wars, the thinning conversations. There was nothing else left to make up for the anger, the hurt. Nothing else left to anticipate. He stopped trying. I eventually did the same. 


Till today, a tiny part of me is still deeply convinced that at least at some point, a part of him loved me sincerely. That he saw in me what I had envisioned for us and our relationship. Maybe I'm being delusional. He always told me that he loved me very much and why he did those manipulative and abusive acts were because he was afraid of losing me just like he did with his ex-girlfriends. 


He cooked/bought me food, he sang to me songs, he paid for our outings, he gave me presents and occasional cards, he sent me home almost every time we went out, he was never embarrassed about revealing me to his friends and he always openly proclaimed out relationship to others. To be fair, he did try to cut down on the number of cigarettes he smoke given that he used to be a chain-smoker. He even planned a sweet birthday surprise for me and made me feel very special on particular occasions.


That's most insidious thing about toxic relationships - the good and the bad mixes together, and inconsistent/erratic behaviour from the other party leaves you more confused and desperate rather than hurt. Everyone else around you could see how detrimental this relationship is to you, they ask you to just walk out of it like walking out of a door - but we all know its not that easy.


Whenever you're ready to end it, whenever you're utterly convinced this is really harmful for you, whenever you come to realize how bad the situation is - suddenly the going gets great. He's nice, gentle, and yearning for affection. Either that or you're mercilessly gaslighted and then it's all YOUR fault. A toxic relationship means endless nights of crying your eyes out and  praying the next day you're not going to be breaking any eggshells around him.


You're constantly hoping he's going to change for the better, to fulfill the dreams you all spend hours discussing. I refused to believe that the restrictions he imposed onto me was only to protect his ego and satisfy his egoistical desire to OWN things (especially his girlfriends) completely. I refused to believe that this man I had fallen for would consider hurting me or stop loving me. 


I'm glad it's over now - it felt like I've been purged of something dark and terribly poisonous. My health (physical and mental) has improved ever since the relationship came to an end. I managed to reconnect with some of my old friends. I'm closer with my family, and I focus all the positive energy on improving myself.


Sometimes I forget I'm no longer accountable to him for who I went out with, to which places, till what time, for what reasons. Sometimes I still panic when I forget to delete messages. 


A lot of the posts here ask for relationship advice and from the content of these posts, I see a strong awareness of the massive red flags (and this is also why you worry about them). Only you know best whether your partner has the will to change for the better, for the sake of your happiness and the relationship you share. 


I hate to break it to you but some people are never going to change. Some abusive partners may eventually become enlightened about their behaviours but most of the toxic relationships I've come to know did not yield happy endings. 


Go seek out all the advice possible from your friends. Go visit a counsellor (there are free ones, search harder!) to talk through it. Discuss with your siblings, your family members, your cousins if it helps. Most importantly, speak to your partner- be honest about your feelings (be tactful if you can), and exchange truthful confessions. Give them some time and a chance to prove their willingness to change for the better.


If they don't, leave them. Leave them quickly before your emotional roots sink deeper and don't look back in regret. Its like plucking out a decaying teeth - you don't pluck it out bit by bit do you. You pluck it out in WHOLE. It will hurt initially, but time - the best remedy - will heal the wounds. Even the deep scars will fade into faint etch marks of wisdom.


Don't be afraid of the pain of leaving a (toxic) relationship. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. You deserve to be loved better than this. 

Being out of a romantic relationship is not the end of the world. It's a new beginning in your life. It never has to be lonely.

Love is all around you if you look closely enough - kinship, friendships and most importantly: 

Yourself. "
1561,59722,To the guy who found a black iPod Touch in the USC 3rd floor toilet (between 10am - 12pm) thanks so much for retrieving my item for me. It’ll be great to eventually get it back though. Cheers hahaha 
1562,59721,"Genuine question before I join NUS after NS, but got some troll reply the other time...

Taking my finances into consideration,  I need the mac for xcode and I don't have the money for large storage to bootcamp or another Windows laptop."
1563,59720,"This has been on my mind, but I wasn’t sure if it was worth a post or rant. Until some complaints about people not receiving text msg till few days later came about. 

Does anyone feels e same way 
It irks me when people dun activate blue tick on their WhatsApp. And it is even worst if you dun bother replying or give super late reply few days later 

I’m totally fine if you read my msg on e same day but reply few days later and I would know cause blue tick will tell me that you have read it 

But when e contacts dun activate e blueticks and dun reply I’m like how do I know if e msg has been send and received. Are u still there or has sth happen 

Which brings me to the next point 
The reason why people dun activate blue ticks is because people in general expect their friend to reply instantly after all we live in e age of instant gratification and how long does it take to reply to a text msg right? 

But we forget get the world doesn’t revolve around us and our friends/ gf/bf/ best friend does not need to reply us instantly if they think e matter can wait. 

I know of friends whose partner read their text on the same day but reply four to 5 days later. 

But thanks to blue tick tech at least e sender has known tt e msg has been read. 

Cause there are people out there who just dun like to use their phone tt much. 

So to confessor #59720. Since ur bf doesn’t reply instantly to his friends too it does shows tt he dun like to reply instantly tt often. But if he still shows up and meeting and spend time with you tt good 

So ask yourself if this really bothers u tt much to e extend of breaking up, what are some compromise tt you guys can come up with. 

Cause I honestly feel it is a trival but important issue and if you guys dun communicate about it how are u guys doing to stay together through other issues and difficulties faced. 

Lack of communication is one of the reason why breakups happen. But what does a evergreen  person in my 20s know."

Hey #59677 , this is coming from a guy whos going for exchange soon. I also have a girl which I like but I honestly don't think I'll tell her about it before I leave. Chances are that you are probably not the same girl I have in mind, but just let me pretend as if you were her.

I really like you too, to the point that receiving wa messages from you will make my entire day. But I probably won't be confessing to you in person. Cos while I know that we are close, I don't know what you think of me. Am I special to you? Or am I just another one of your close guy friend, like the other one you often hang out with? 

I had a close friend which I liked back in JC as well. But when I confessed to her, things didnt turn out well and I lost her even as a friend. Because of this I am still afraid to confess to you because I'm afraid to lose the status quo. If anything, I dont mind being your friend for a little longer.

I wish we could get even closer, find more excuses to hang out together, so I can know for sure that you are interested in me as I am in you, especially in the upcoming sem break before I leave for SEP. Once I establish that we are mutually interested in each other. I will definitely confess to you. If not, I'll probably keep my feelings to myself.

1565,59718,"To the commenters of #59672 regarding the question of whether guys will be intimidated by a girl from the most elite course. As to your question, I would consider myself to be above average looks, getting picked up by strangers for random purpose on the street, having people confessed and having a couple of boyfriends in my life. So I would not say I am unattractive. My concern is that being an elite person in both acads and looks, I genuinely wonder if it will intimidate guys in general because I have been socialising for a bit and wonder if anything serious will come out of it besides people merely praising me or hitting on me. Firstly, I am definitely not arrogant but nature but I am definitely aware of how being in an elite course has subjected me to be shunned by some people who only seem to focus on my identity as that. My friend has brought that issue to my attention which is why I am seeking advice from you all here, not for you all to criticise that I am being arrogant or so. I do not deny I recognise this privilege and I am just concerned what others may think. If I were that arrogant, I would post this non anonymously or ask people in my life directly rather than sieve through anonymous opinions here. I am genuinely asking if guys will be intimated or withdraw in some sense. "

Your parents passed away right as I got to know you, while I was an orphan in an orphanage. You cried to me and I felt your pain. I wanted to put a smile on your face and always be there for you.

I liked you, but I never told you. 
We had another friend who liked you too. Me and him knew that we both liked you and I told him to go for it, because I felt that you liked him more, romantically. I was more of a brother to you. I could not take the step myself to try and ask you out, while he did.

I knew my friend was a very good person, someone you deserved. As for me, I had no home, no personality, no looks. I was a loner, and we only became close because you were the bubbly girl who talked to everyone.

Even though I supported him dating you, every step of the way I felt more and more pain as I saw you guys getting closer while still including me in your meet ups. Many times, I was close to tearing up, seeing how he could bring a smile to your face and just self-loathing myself. You guys got together eventually, while I disappeared away on my own choice.

I signed on and went off the grid from you guys. Deep down, I hoped you would continue to keep in touch with me, but I continuously found excuses to not show up for meetups and you eventually stopped asking.

Then last year, I received an invitation letter from you. It was for your wedding. You got married to him and you're living in bliss now. I'm happy for you guys too. I went to your wedding, stayed a while and left. You texted and asked why I left without telling. I'm sorry I didn't stay longer on your biggest day, but if I did I would have cried and ruined your moment.

It was a first love, and a one-sided love. I made an excuse that I had to disappear from your life because I didn't want to make my friend uneasy being close to you, since he and i knew we both liked you. But the truth is I was cowardly and still am. I still do not know how to move on, but I will, because I love you and he is my friend too.

1573,59699,"hey #59651, just like you, 
I went through the hoe phase a few years ago. After I lost my mom to an accident, my world fell apart and I felt like a part of me died and I didn't deserve to feel happy anymore. I also had a long-time bf but at that point of time, he was really busy with work. 

I often felt empty and isolated. I then left him for another guy who turned out to be emotionally abusive and the relationship left me with nothing but tears and disappointment. I started partying every weekend and had a few fwbs to numb the pain. Eventually I got tired of everything and decided to end my partying ways. 

I then focused on rebuilding my relationship with my friends and family whom I had neglected and it gave me a new sense of belonging. I also started doing volunteering work to give my life a new purpose. I then met someone through volunteering.

I began to see a future with him and so I decided to get myself tested and it came back clean. I decided to confess to him about my past and sadly, he started to see me in a different light and so we slowly drifted apart. I don't blame him because afterall, he's a very eligible guy who deserved someone better. 

Honestly, I have no regrets in life and I think you shouldn't have any regrets too. Why? Because there's no point in having regrets. As cliche as it sounds, everything happens for a reason. 

After I broke up with my then bf, I met my abusive ex. Because of that, I learned to appreciate my friends and family more. My friends then introduced me to volunteering where I made many like-minded friends and developed a new purpose in life. 

If I hadn't partied so hard, I wouldn't have realised that drinking and partying can never truly take away the pain in me and that they are just temporary solutions. 

Don't regret. Don't look back. You have paid the price for your bad decisions and you have learned your mistakes. You have grown wiser and stronger because of the pain you have been through. Love yourself. Forgive yourself.

1579,59690,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to use this platform to gain some relationship advice. I've been in a relationship for close to 3 years now, and I'm wondering... Does your other half ever end up changing his/her bad habits for your sake despite you repeatedly talking to him/her about it? These bad habits are ones that I feel like it's really tough for me to tolerate and despite talking to him about it, arguing with him about it, he is perpetually telling me ""I understand"", but nothing ever seems to change. It got me thinking, could I be expecting too much out of him? 

These bad habits include: 
• Firstly, his lack of effort in interacting with my parents when he comes over to my place. He simply says hi to both of them, showers, then stays in my room the whole day. Or when my parents fetches him home, he doesn't even bother to make small talk with them in the car... And for me, I feel like that is quite disrespectful. I think being an ''introvert'' is not an excuse at all, because I also do make an effort to make small talk with his parents, buy food for his parents when I go over to his place. So for me, I can't quite understand why he just can't do the same for me.
• Secondly, we are taking a few classes together so naturally, we decided to be in the same project groups. However, he hasn't been doing much work at all for these projects that we are together, just physically appearing for meetings while he focuses his time on projects from other modules. I am also taking other modules in this semester, but I still believe in doing my best for all projects across all modules. Honestly, I'm just perplexed as to why he thinks that by doing projects with me, it gives him the leeway to relax and focus his time on projects for other modules... 
• Thirdly, his actions constantly contradicts what he tells me. Every now and then, he likes to tell me that a relationship is all about giving 100% from both parties, and that he truly loves me a lot. Yet, he also expects me to just throw aside whatever I feel (such as stress from the semester) to be there for him, throw aside whatever work I have to help him with his work and so on. I feel that I have been just giving, and not receiving at all throughout this relationship. I know it's an unhealthy mindset to have but at the same time, I can't just keep giving but not receiving because when I talk to him now, I feel so exhausted and drained. I used to look forward to his text messages but not anymore.

And to be honest, I am just touching the tip of the iceberg with these few bad habits which I feel like I can't tolerate (anyone feel me?). Other things include how he's always tardy with repaying me (the money just accumulates), his inability to understand my frustration (oh I've tried scolding, talking nicely, discussing.. None works - he just tells me he understands and proceeds to do the exact same mistake the next week) and so on. I feel really drained, and at this point in time I'm just wondering if I should just end the relationship. It would be great if you can share with me your advice, thanks everyone!

1580,59688,"I had a very serious crush on my jc classmate for a few years. In those few years no other man existed in my eyes. But the phase is over because I kind of let him know how I feel about him but he did not respond. So I accepted the rejection and I have decided to move on. However, moving on is not as easy as I thought it would be. 
I have liked around 4 guys in this past 2 years. But none of the crushes are as serious as the jc one. The reason I like those guys is usually because they reminded me of my jc crush... 
Subconsciously I will compare all my crushes with my jc crush and I find it really ridiculous since I have already told myself to give up. 
I realize I couldn’t like anyone seriously anymore. At most I find the person cute and nice and that’s about it. I couldn’t like him with the same intensity as I liked my jc crush. And the feeling is really fleeting like I can like for a few days and simply forget about this feeling.
It is like as though I just like someone for the sake of liking someone.

1583,59684,"Dear #59684, unlike those people who commented on your post, I'm not here to judge or condemn you. 

You mentioned that you have a gf and got on tinder recently. Have you thought about why you did this? Is it because you were bored or you were trying to find someone new? If you were just bored, you can try to develop new interests and hobbies. If you were looking for a potential partner, you could first evaluate your current relationship i.e. are you happy with your current partner? do you see a future with her? If you're happy and do envision a future with her, I would advise you to stop talking to that new girl before it starts to affect your relationship with your current partner.  

Yes, that new girl may seem very interesting to you. But that could be due to the very fact that you have known her for only 2 weeks. You mentioned that you're not sure if you like her or are infatuated with her. I think it's very easy to 'like' someone, especially if that person is nice and attractive. Based on my own experience, I think infatuations usually don't last. They are merely feelings that fade away as time passes. Afterall, as humans, we are often drawn to new things and then lose interest as the 'newness' wears off.

It's also easy to feel like you've known someone for a long time if you two share a lot of similarities. To be honest, I've met a lot of people whom I felt a great sense of closeness towards because we shared the same thinking and values. Although it certainly felt good to meet such people, it doesn't mean we would be compatible in the long run. 

You also mentioned that you got physical with that new girl but didn't move onto the bed. Are you trying to say you have not cheated? Everyone has a different definition when it comes to cheating. Some people may feel that cheating means seeing two person at the same time. Some may feel that cheating means having sex with someone other than your sexual partner. It doesn't matter what other people think. It doesn't matter what your definition is. Most importantly, you have to ask yourself if you want to continue to stay in your current relationship. 

The length of a relationship may not be the best gauge of the quality of a relationship. But I think 5 years is quite a good amount of time to get to know someone well. Throughout these 5 years, I'm sure there were ups and downs and you should be able to see if you partner would be a good match in the long run. If you don't see her as a good match, you should end things with her as soon as you can. Then you can take your time to get to know the new girl before taking it to the next level. All the best.

I really like you too, to the point that receiving wa messages from you will make my entire day. But I probably won't be confessing to you in person. Cos while I know that we are close, I don't know what you think of me. Am I special to you? Or am I just another one of your close guy friend, like the other one you often hang out with? 

I had a close friend which I liked back in JC as well. But when I confessed to her, things didnt turn out well and I lost her even as a friend. Because of this I am still afraid to confess to you because I'm afraid to lose the status quo. If anything, I dont mind being your friend for a little longer.

I wish we could get even closer, find more excuses to hang out together, so I can know for sure that you are interested in me as I am in you, especially in the upcoming sem break before I leave for SEP. Once I establish that we are mutually interested in each other. I will definitely confess to you. If not, I'll probably keep my feelings to myself.

There was a group I used to be a part of, but they've moved out and stopped inviting me to join their gatherings (understandably). I went to their place sometimes and ended up studying instead, things were just not the same. 

At day, I study hard and feel alright. I'm happy about my grades and excited about what I'm studying. But at night, I terribly crave for human interactions. I go to the gym, eat, watch Korean dramas to numb these feelings and exhaust myself so that I can sleep. I just don't know how long I can last this way.

I made bad life choices and didn't appreciate my friends while they were around. I also can't rely on my family as parents keep arguing with each other. I don't want to go home. I've tried attending events in my interests, talking about personal stuff with project mates, and introducing myself to people who sit alone in lectures. There was no awkward silence, the conversation flowed, but I found it hard to ask them out after that. I'm not sure if they need a new companionship as I do.

1599,59654,"It's not mother's day yet but i realised that ladies esp mothers shld be appreciated more.

I really appreciate my mom. Why? This is because she carried the infant me in her belly for 9 months. And every mom did the same for everyone who is reading this post.

You see, she carries you for 9 months, she may have to sacrifice her full time job to take care of you, and let her body to rest etc (There's a long list). The sacrifices they have made is really tremendous & very Respectful.

Besides sacrificing, there are so much emotional swings & insecurities they face. Sadly, there are some moms who are left to take care of their infant alone (as boyfriend/hubby doesn't want to take responsibility)

I grew up with both of my parents often in long cold wars. Like can last up to 6 months or longer. prob 8 months. And every time they argue, i got frightened. (In some cases, couples may be violent to each other too)

Over the years, if your mom chose to be the homemaker, she has really done alot of stuff (ie. cooking, cleaning up, washing, ironing, marketing etc etc).

Tbh, i've never learnt how to wash my clothes/hang my clothes to dry etc.. i just feel indebted to her. I'm alrdy 22. Yes, it's time for me to learn and take on more responsibility. 

Right now, she's almost retiring from her part time job, and I hope can be more responsible for her and myself and take care of her when she is in her golden years. I know money can't buy everything (i.e i bought birdnest on bdays etc) I need to be obedient and responsible so that she doesnt need to worry about me anymore (they showed so much concern when you were a baby till now..)

Which is why some people say, find your partner who shares similar traits to your mom. Because of her sacrifices, her effort to love you, her constant worry etc have made you who you are today. Just like how your partner can potentially change you for the better. Someone who will always be there for you.

The way my dad ""treated"" my mom in the past was really harsh that I shed tears on certain arguments. And i really wanted to protect my mom at that time but i couldn't because i was just a child. Hence, growing up i promised to protect her. 

Ps. my parents are more loving now, cold wars don't happen so frequent now, once in awhile and it lasts at most 1 week? I'm kinda glad. 

I promised myself, that if i were to find a partner, i make sure that i love her wholeheartedly. Besides giving her a comfortable life, but also to appreciate her. 

I hope that this post would justify on why i think mothers shld be appreciated more. And guys shld treat their girlfriend better, because can you imagine they will go through so much in their life, longer than the 2 years we served. I promised myself, never let my future girlfriend  to go through this situation.

1602,59651,"hey #59651, just like you, 
I went through the hoe phase a few years ago. After I lost my mom to an accident, my world fell apart and I felt like a part of me died and I didn't deserve to feel happy anymore. I also had a long-time bf but at that point of time, he was really busy with work. 

I often felt empty and isolated. I then left him for another guy who turned out to be emotionally abusive and the relationship left me with nothing but tears and disappointment. I started partying every weekend and had a few fwbs to numb the pain. Eventually I got tired of everything and decided to end my partying ways. 

I then focused on rebuilding my relationship with my friends and family whom I had neglected and it gave me a new sense of belonging. I also started doing volunteering work to give my life a new purpose. I then met someone through volunteering.

I began to see a future with him and so I decided to get myself tested and it came back clean. I decided to confess to him about my past and sadly, he started to see me in a different light and so we slowly drifted apart. I don't blame him because afterall, he's a very eligible guy who deserved someone better. 

Honestly, I have no regrets in life and I think you shouldn't have any regrets too. Why? Because there's no point in having regrets. As cliche as it sounds, everything happens for a reason. 

After I broke up with my then bf, I met my abusive ex. Because of that, I learned to appreciate my friends and family more. My friends then introduced me to volunteering where I made many like-minded friends and developed a new purpose in life. 

If I hadn't partied so hard, I wouldn't have realised that drinking and partying can never truly take away the pain in me and that they are just temporary solutions. 

Don't regret. Don't look back. You have paid the price for your bad decisions and you have learned your mistakes. You have grown wiser and stronger because of the pain you have been through. Love yourself. Forgive yourself.

1603,59648,"Just my take on the whole ""smart girls, sexist guys"" issue- I don't see why there is such a gendered divide with how the issue is discussed. 

I have been in both male-dominated environments and female-dominated environments. I would agree that there are some guys who are very charismatic and overconfident, and there are rarely girls who act that confident. And as for the people who treat girls too gently, possibly by way of underestimation, those are  usually guys as well. 

But I find other girls just as scary. Girls may not underestimate your book smarts, but they can get jealous and paranoid of it. They can backstab you as well as a guy can, maybe even better, because all the while they will sing praises of how smart and how useful you are. They can drive a group project off the cliff, just as well as guys can. They too can say a lot about nothing, and even if they arent as charismatic and confident, they may be hugely popular by other means. They can exclude and ostracise you, perhaps even in ways that most guys dont know how to-- and they may do that because they are afraid of your book smarts. 

Maybe they are afraid you will give them a bad peer evaluation because they arent as smart with academics. Maybe they think you are one more data point on the bell curve, stopping them from getting their FCH. Maybe all this isn't even about your grades or your intelligence, they just don't like you. Rest assured they will never tell you why. I am as afraid of sexist guys as I am of these mysterious girls. 

A sexist guy might give you the easy part of the project, because he thinks you cant do anything more-- he thinks you're dumb. A scheming girl gives you the easy part, because she wants to trash you in the peer evaluation for being lazy and not contributing as much, and talking up her harder portion instead. She thinks you're book smart, and that might mean you are done for."

1. European girls have no problem to meet new Asian guys, to have small chat...

2. but when it comes to deeper relationship topic, or sexual/hookup topic, European women tend to be more conservative on non-european and less likely open the opportunity to Asian guy. They also prefer to stick with people from their own country (so this trend is NOT just for PRC!)

This also means my code is not elegant and readability is compromised. Idk how to fix this problem of mine and don't really know any platforms to share my concern on. ):

I would really appreciate any advice or help given thanks a lot!"

1619,59628,"I've just got one piece of advice to people find it hard to get dates: Please learn some self grooming. Despite what people like to say, it is a fact that looks and appearances are very important factors that contribute to others' impressions of you. 

Proper self grooming shows others that, at the very least, you care about yourself enough to put in the effort to look good in front of others. If you are not even interested in taking care of yourself, how do you expect others to take an interest in you?"
1620,59627,"Regarding those who mentioned about dating same age or younger, I am a lady, dating a guy 5 years younger than me (he is in early 20s and im im late 20s). 

I was really skeptical about it because the age difference is really too huge, felt like im gonna baby sit him. Also partly because i have dated same age and one year younger who are super immature when it comes to dating. But I was wrong, age is just a number. I guess it's the experiences we went through in our lives respectively that can allow us to be connected. If i were to date someone older but has been a prince the whole life who cant eat kopitiam food, does it mean that the relationship will turn out to be better? No. Thats why, age really doesnt matter. 

So we have been dating for 3 years and my pay is at least 2 times of his. He never knew and he never asked. He mentioned that it doesnt change the way he gonna love and dote on me even if I receive better education than him or receiving higher pay than him. He still wants to pay for small little things when we are out, and i would do vice versa. We dont argue about money. 

I was so afraid that someone younger and prettier may appear and cause the downfall of the relationship, but i literally think too much because he was also afraid someone handsome and more mature appear would take me away from him. We reassured each other from time to time to keep our relationship strong. 

To be honest, ever since we started dating, i actually forgotten that he is younger than me. All i know is im in love with someone i want to spend my life with, and nothijg else matters anymore. 

We both invested our time and effort in something and someone we know its gonna last for life. 

So now, he has popped the question during our 3rd year anniversary and we are looking at a simple wedding will do. 

Before meeting him, i always tell everyone i will never date someone younger, but i guess life is making me a fool for being too sure about something uncertain - the future.

Is okay I also spend about S$1k in Taobao this morning.->Ok what did you spend it on

Rent one instead->Rent which one?

Nah, photography is for losers. Can’t you find a better hobby.->Was planning to use the camera for video recording.

Dont listen to people who say ""Money cant buy happiness"" ???? Everybody has/needs a hobby->That is why I am asking about this.

If you’re looking for affirmation here it is. Yes.->Not helpful, but ok

Buy stuff that you will use frequently, don't buy those that you use once in a while.-> I could argue that I would use those items at least once a week, would that be frequent enough?

1. Will you bring around a tripod when you are out->More for stabilizing my phone if I shoot video at home while using a device for example
2. A phone camera can easily double up as a digital camera in the $400 price range ->If want to do a tech vlog start small with phone camera then?
3. Keyboard and mouse can buy if you intend to use them daily->Ok then
4. I don't see a need for a SIM router->Because I have a 2GB/day data plan and bringing another phone around means the need to carry a power bank just in case.
5. Might be a need if you own the new MBP. I suggest looking on carousell for much cheaper type C hubs. I got mine for $49->May consider, but it is not for an MBP.
6. Might be a need if you are short on storage->More for backup purposes

Rule of thumb: if you wait for 1-2 months, you might feel that you no longer need the item. After waiting, if you still feel that these items will really aid your productivity, then get it!->1TB HDD been thinking about it since February,SIM router since end of winter vacation, camera and tripod since winter break,Type C adapter since January.

Buy everything from carousell. If you happen to not like it or need it, you can relist them on carousell and get back most of the money.->IT Fair this weekend though

For you, I felt happy and yet at the same time sadness.
Sad that I won't be seeing for for quite a while
Sad that I won't be able to see your beautiful smile. 
Sad that I won't be able to hear your rants. 
Happy 
That you are.. happy 

Not that we have been seeing other much anyways, after all we are just friends, but whenever we do meet, I feel comfortable around u, and happy, even though I may not show it.

I am going to cherish the time that I can catch you in school or during lessons.

I will never tell you this but I know I will miss you, and I think i fell for u..

I wish you all the best on your exchange! Have the best time in your life! Play hard and work hard, have fun and grow! 

I hope that we stay in contact although I highly doubt that given how popular u already are in school now.. 

After all.. 
We are just friends...

My theory is about the messed up Singapore market and in terms of dating opportunities for guys. I'm writing from the standpoint as a Single, Male singaporean who I consider decent looking but argue all you want about me, I'm here to discuss about the issue at hand.
So the issue here is Singapore naturally has a unfair environment for guys in terms of dating opportunities and my theory is tied to National Service. Lets assume that there is a same population of guys and girls for argument's sake. Out of whatever that number is, lets assume if you groom and really take care of your body and overall health you become decent looking. Assuming there is a natural number of 100k decent looking guys and 100 decent looking girls. Because of NS, the amount of Decent looking guys increased to 200k because of all the shit NS throws at us.

TLDR: 
Less supply of decent girls = shortage of decent girls
High supply of decent guys = overflowing supply decent guys

Girls naturally has a higher bargaining power and guys lose out. How can guys (decent or not) hope to survive in this environment? (P.s. I'm pretty sure most of you will say Up your standard or something along those lines which is unrealistic and all, those who have serious inputs do give your advice, thanks)"

Not sure if I'm too used to the blessings of the bell curve god back in my days as an undergraduate at NUS but I was just dismayed by the subpar grade for one of my coursework modules. The important thing is: nearly everyone else in the class got a B-/C+ too, and the best grade I heard was a B. Unless everyone underperformed, or just plainly couldn't care enough to bother about the term papers and final exam, is it unfair to think that me and my coursemates deserve a better grade for all our effort?

Will a group appeal to the examining authorities be a good idea? We are pretty sure it's not going to improve our grades very much but it doesn't seem unreasonable to want to voice our grievances and perhaps, spare future cohorts from a similar fate under the offending lecturer.

1648,59581,"Hi #59547, I dated a guy 2 years younger than me so I kinda understand how you feel. 

I was already working when I met my then bf. He was a year 1 student and comes from a poor family that relied on relatives for financial support. His uncle gave him $150 a month and he did a few internships and gave tuition to sec sch students for extra pocket money. I offered to pay for meals most of the time but he also offered to pay whenever he received his tuition earnings. 

In order to save up for our future wedding and house, we tried our best to be as thrifty as possible. We mostly dined at coffeeshops and spent our time watching downloaded movies at home. We agreed to not buy gifts for each other and to travel overseas only after he grad. Despite being so poor, he never fails to buy me my favourite food when I feel down and give me handmade cards on my birthday. 

Last year, he graduated and managed to find a job that pays well. Every year he would ask me what I want for my birthday and I would always say I don't want anything. However, a few months ago, he gave me a diamond ring for my birthday. Yes, he proposed and we are now looking for a house.  

I used to jokingly ask him if he would ever leave me for those prettier and younger ladies at his workplace. He would tell me, ""you've always been there for me throughout all these years of hardship, no one can replace the love and support you've given me, I wouldn't be where I am today if you weren't there for me and for that, I wanna give you the best life you could ever have"". 

To answer your question, yes, it is not practical to date a guy of the same age or even younger than you. You would have to make compromises and sacrifices along the way. But he would be eternally grateful for your support and see you as the most precious gem in the world if you ever stick with him through thick and thin. I would say it's definitely worth giving it a try. "
1649,59580,"Regarding the smart girl debate, it's not really an issue about finding mates. Nor is it dismissing other talents (e.g. Athletic or artistic prowess). It's more about having our voices heard and being respected by guys. So many guys just assume that we are dumb and don't know what we're doing. I've been in so many group projects where everything i say is ignored even when I've done loads of research and put a lot of thought into the project. I have to argue twice as hard just for my project mates to even consider what I'm saying while everyone follows the confident guy even though he is just smoking his way through. There have been countless instances where an arrogant guy refuses to listen to me and caused the whole project to tank. When we talked to the professor about the project, the feedback they gave was exactly what i said. The debate is not really about smart girls vs the world. I'm just really sick of being dismissed. All girls just wanna be respected for our intelligence, as well as other ""conventionally masculine"" talents. "

1651,59577,"Hello Whispers! I have a crush on a guy for a year but until now I still haven't told him. Ever since I was a child, I don't seem to know how to express my love for a person. Until he left me for exchange, the connection between us was also reduced by the time difference(-14hrs). A week after he left, I began to feel that I should have liked him. How do I feel this feeling? I have always been a person who can concentrate on learning, but I found that half a sem is almost over, and I feel that it is terrible to spend every day thinking about him. If I continue this way, my midterms and finals should be terrible which I don't want to happen at all.

He has a very good personality and we went hanging out a few times before he left. He told me that he is not a romantic person ever. btw we are both evergreen.  

In a way, I think I realized that I need to tell him my feeling pretty late, and he has studied abroad and will return next sem, I prefer to say these in person. On the other hand, I don't want to be rejected by him online, I guess that's feeling sucks. However, I want to let him know now then I can go back to focus on studying.

1652,59576,"Reading stuff here reminded me of a guy I once hooked up with. (no he's not from arts, he's from engineering, but his course is almost an even split gender ratio... His lab group last year had 3 girls in it.) Maybe it's something about these ""player"" type guys that make them apply to courses with female majorities or basically fertile hunting grounds...

He's the kind that gets hook ups often, saw his tinder match history when we were out (I was one of them). I can't say was surprised by his performance in the bedroom, coming from someone who didn't even bother counting his ""conquests"" or ""numbers"". Probably too many to count, or he intentionally left the number hazy, and I'm not sure even he knows that number.

He wasn't really male underwear model standard, just average and in good shape. Just very vocal and convincing I guess.

Though yes, I'll admit I'm pretty sold on his ""I've turned over a new leaf"" appearance these days, he's been dating the same girl for about a year, which is a stark departure from the 3 month ""relationships"" that he used to have.

I think I've waxed on and off quite strangely about this so I guess I'll just give my point here straight.

I can see him putting in effort in this relationship, and honestly as someone from the outside I can see that he's really trying his best and not just going through the motions. He's changed quite a lot since that time. So party girl, party guy, cheater or serial playboy, I think they all deserve a second chance. Reputation may be a good way to judge people, their past does tell you who they're likely to be, but it may no longer be an accurate gauge of people.

Just because people did things in the past doesn't mean that that behavior will continue indefinitely into the future. People can and do change. Maybe some don't, but I'm sure given enough effort people do change if they want to. Maybe you're not willing to be the person that gives them that second chance. Well that's fine too, to each his own. But I guess maybe it's time to be tolerant about other people's choices, as long as it doesn't affect you, I'm not sure you can really get angry about it. Why bother sticking your nose into where it doesn't belong? Don't we all have enough to deal with on our own already?

Why am I posting about this guy? Well, because it seems that his behavior has turned a complete 180. He's just so different that I almost thought that he was just someone else that looked like him. Maybe it's too early to tell whether he's really changed for the better, but I guess I'll just give him the benefit of the doubt.

Everyone has their own story to tell, and everyone has their own journey to make. Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions about who they are just because of *one* thing you've heard them do. Opinions are fine, just don't badger people with them. By that same coin, it's fine if you all disagree with me, and if you think people are set in their ways too. We'll just have to agree to disagree about this. Peace people, don't be negative, be positive. "

No amount of saying how you are deserved to be liked just because you are smart will make guys like you.

Being relaxed is key! When you're nervous your body will tense up which will make it uncomfortable for you, and probably for your partner too.

1661,59562,"ok, dear #59518 OP, I know you were asking the ladies, but I'm a guy and I'd offer your bf some tips, though I don't know him so I suppose I'm offering you some tips hoping it'll help you both.

Well the first time will hurt, but I think there's a way to ease it through. Firstly, get yourself a bottle of lube. Cuz not everyone is naturally lubed up enough to have sex. Lube kinda allows it to slide in more easily, otherwise some of the pain you feel is dry skin versus dry skin of your sensitive bits trying so hard to slide past each other.

The second thing is, I think it can be a lot less painful if you both start with fingering (I hope he at least knows what to do with his fingers!). I did that on my ex first, and the advice I'm giving you got us to have sex without too much pain. The hole in the hymen should be large enough for a finger to go in. Might be a little tight at first but with lube and some patience it can be loosened up. If he knows how to find and stimulate your G spot, all the better. Gotta be real patient with this one. Use one finger to kinda stretch it a little in all directions, gradually of course. Then if it becomes loose enough, try two, and use the two to stretch it a little more.

If necessary, spread out between sessions. not all in one day.

Then finally, you can try the actual tool. Just, lube again, and lots of foreplay.

Results will differ, cuz remember every woman's body is different.

By the way, there's also the possibility you're having vaginisimus. One of my ex gf's had that, and she would recoil violently the moment I touched her vaginal opening. I didn't know what it was at the time (we were young but definitely way old enough to legally have sex).

A quick google search gets me this:

1663,59560,"Is there a way to complain about lab GAs in engineering? It's obvious that the GA in my lab only has eyes for girls and doesn't care about the rest of us guys (we're in engin, there's one group with 5 girls and 4 groups with all guys). He's been pretty much ""stationed"" over at the lab group with the girls for half a semester already, but today was even worse than before. He spent about 2 hours of a 2.5 hour lab at the girls' table, and ignored several of our groups who told him about problems with the calibration of our lab apparatus that messed up our results. Not only that, but he went through the whole lab report with their group, down to the level of telling them the explanations and marking points for each question. I'm quite sure that's academic dishonesty somehow. We've tried bringing our concerns to the prof for our lab group, but he also always seems to disappear partway through the lab session."

1666,59556,Serious question here. I have a crush on my internship friend who is working in the same company as me. But his department is at the other far end of the company office. He doesn't seem like the kind who will initiate a conversation with people so how should I go about hitting him up?
1667,59555,"I'm old OP from #59555. Thanks for mostly positive response I have received. My NUS CELC teachers would be proud since I pretty much learned English in NUS. 
Anyway, to respond questions regarding CAP, I was lucky. In year 4, FYP had the highest credit weights. So effectively, as long as I did A in FYP, I could mess up other modules and nothing could change CAP much. By the end of year 3, I fulfilled many graduation requirements since I did not do semester long industrial attachments. (I found that many attachment programs were borderline useless. Some big companies such as Exxon asking engineering students to deal with their retail business etc). 
I also had great lab mates to be motivated and a group of good friends  to help me focus. Since friends were Singaporean guys, they were like big brothers to me. 
Yes, it has been long long time ago. Last week, I brought my son to a tech museum and showed him old IBM PC with Floppy drive. I explained to him that that's where we saved our files. I told him that when I first arrived in University, I did not even know that those little disks needed to go there and I saved files. (computer illiterate). So, I hoped I conveyed the message to my son regarding how far we have come. I hoped it was as good as other stories of immigrant parents (usually written by Indian kids) coming to Silicon Valley with some dollar notes (almost always under $50) and became a VP in big tech company. 

I also owe a lot to great lecturers such as Prof.Aaron Tan, who made computing fun, and I ended up doing this as a career."

1671,59549,"I'd been thinking I wasn't too bad. Decent CAP, decent going internship, decent going projects. I think I can graduate and get a sufficiently good job. Life has gone pretty alright. For the moment.

And that's the thing. I tell myself that. But I also see myself walking a tightrope. One failure, one slide, one drop, and everything will unravel. Everything will all go to pieces. How do I explain why I'm so tired? How do I deal with the errors creeping in, sometimes too late to notice? How can I show I'm trying? How can I, when I'm sure the outside world will only see laziness, carelessness, uselessness? How will I deal with disaster; will there ever be a coming back from one anymore?

So damn much to worry about. Will I do enough for my family. Can I keep us from going under, into poverty and suffering? Will I keep pace in this cut-throat rat race? Will I disappoint the people I know and love? What's the lowest I can sink? How can I stay afloat?

I'm bending under stress. How can I not break? How can I not snap? How can I not shatter? How would I ever come back?"

1673,59547,"Hi,  #59547,  i dated and married a guy the same age as me.  

During our dates,  we either go dutch or i will pay if he runs out of pocket money.  After his graduation, his starting pay is less than mine since i already had a 2 year headstart.  But he caught up quite fast. I can't remember when he caught up but after working for about 8 years,  his annual pay is 3 times of mine.  Now,  he pays for everything.

I guess what i am trying to say is if you think he is the one for you,  the 2 years of delay wont really matter.  After all,  you will still be spending time together. And once he starts work,  he may not be worse off than the older guys. 

To be exact,  he is 3 months younger than me.

1674,59546,"Hi, glad you are reading this. You don't know me, and I don't know you. But still, I want you to know something. You see, when we were young, many of us had the most crazy, amazing dreams. We were astronauts, dancers, actresses, singers and superheroes. I can't imagine the number of hours singing at home telling myself I was going to be a singer one day. But somehow along the line, society taught us to be realistic and to chase what is practical, and we give up those dreams to pursue more realistic ones. Also, there was pressure everywhere. Every step you took, someone was watching. Whether it was to make someone you love proud, or to show everyone you were a loser.

And I understand. The pressure is immense, and life is hard. We are all under pressure to succeed and achieve, and we felt that no one thought much of us if we don't achieve anything. We never felt so alone, growing up, looking at the achievements of others, comparing, and regretting this and that. We felt like the world has forgotten us.

But I haven't. And if this is you, I care. I don't need to know your face or your name, but I do. From one human to another, deep down, I want you to live, and I want you to smile, even if every step you take was one of suffering.

If you are out there, feeling lost, feeling alone, feeling like no one remembers or knows the real you. Don't give up. I know and I believe that deep down, you want to achieve great things, and I know you can do this, regardless of your story.

You could be suffering from depression, a cap 5.0 student, a loner, a star athlete, a party girl, a jc student, a poly student, a poor student working 2 jobs and trying to study or just someone trying to live their life. Your story is just as important as the next guy.

So go out and live, not for your parents, not for your friends, and most certainly not for me, but for you. Life is a gift, and I treasure yours as much as you treasure it. At the end of the day, we are all wanderers, venturing through space. We were all born to create, and to discover this world.

Whatever you do, don't lose hope, don't lose your humanity. Life is too short to do too many, but long enough to dedicate to something. When we look down on earth, we see one united mankind, with no divisions and no segregations. 

So you are important, your very existence, has altered the course of the universe. Yes, life is hard. Yes, life is difficult. But you are stronger, whether you believe it or not, however, is a choice. And from one human to another, I love you, and will love you always.

""Pain is always there because life is freaking painful, but suffering is a choice"" - Orange is the new black

Love,
Your Fellow Human"

1688,59524,"Looking at all the fwb and sex before marriage posts, I observed something interesting. You will always be flamed if you say it’s right or it’s wrong to have fwb. 

Defenders of fwb always like to say “not wrong” when posed such question. Upon thinking deeper into the issue, I realize they are just playing the burden of proof game. 

By saying right or wrong, you have to take up the burden of proof and explain your stance. Explanations to such controversial topics will always be bashed and put down, no matter what you say. 

By saying not wrong, there is nothing to proof or justify. This also reduces the decision to personal preferences and opinion. Only things that are right or wrong are objective.

Instead of justifying, it’s so shrewd to shift the burden of proof and find loopholes in other’s proof in an attempt to boost your own stance. If all else fail, just transform everything into subjective opinions and preferences so that you can continue with what you do without caring what other people say.

1689,59521,"There's a lot of antipathy towards the  'smart girls' that have been cropping up lately on NUSWhispers, but to be completely honest I don't have any issue with women who are smart and competent in any discipline. What I have a bit more of an issue with is that there are people (be it women or men) vain enough to consider themselves a 'smart' person as a blanket term. There are so many ways one can be considered smart, and that you are particularly smarter in a few ways that society considers important doesn't make you a 'smart' person, any more than being particularly dumb in other ways makes you a 'dumb' one. 

To all the self-proclaimed 'smart' people out there reading this, please note - you are not special - at least, not anymore than anybody else. You are right that it may be quite possible that society rejects you because you are smarter in those particular aspects, and I appreciate you for raising the issue - but by making a blanket statement that the problem resides (solely) in society, and not with any failing on the part of your character, you lose out on any opportunity for genuine self-reflection and self-improvement.

Being relaxed is key! When you're nervous your body will tense up which will make it uncomfortable for you, and probably for your partner too.

1700,59509,"So I have this weird habit of not sleeping early and sleeping at very random times, so I end up sleeping at times ranging from 1am to 11am (the next day) and sometimes when I have school go to school half-dead (or full-dead) and sleep after class. I'm not particularly proud of it because sometimes it really does take a toll on me. When I tell people about it, mostly the replies are like ""don't study so hard la"" or ""wah actually I slept EVEN LATER sia"" but I was really trying to be serious. My closer friends understand but at the same time they don't provide solutions (they kind of listen to me rant and complain I guess). One of them recommended a therapist to see if this is a psychological problem or maybe even a case of insomnia (but I do get tired and I do sleep when I finally get tired) but to be honest...

I'm really scared because what if there is no actual problem? Then it would seem like I have been chasing an excuse for my bad habits.
And what if there is? Then it would seem like I can just justify all my not-so-decent grades up to now (well decent enough for honours at least)

1707,59502,"Hey admin, it’s the OP from #59224. Didn’t thought there are so many threads following smart girl post!! (Trying not to sound emotional, using 3rd person narrative below) 
Thank you all for listening to my story. The OP has been happily attached and has quite a lot of friends around her, she clicks well with those who shares the same passion or those she admires. To answer some of your questions, she is taking care of her appearance well as she was in charge of CCA fashion design department back in old school. 
However, she feels that sometimes there are definitely drawbacks for being unique, like many people can feel connection with you, but you can only connect with so few. She can speak a few languages, but it is very difficult for people to get a full picture of what she is thinking. She’s never a member of a girl clique either, due to skewed boy to girl ratio in her course and she’s more or less raised up like a guy, interested in history and maths. That fail in connection and constant losing interest in things other people like led her to negative thoughts and she was once keen to read through lots of  psychology books to find what was wrong with her mind. The reason why she said she could not be popular is that she could not keep small talks going.
She’s not perceived as the hardworking type either, but that is exactly what she was talking about. She’s seen girls who asked for help and attention given more credits than those who worked hard and chasing their own dreams, where hardworking and competency are definitely redeeming qualities!! She thinks it is a social phenomenon here (Asia in general) and wants to call out. As she admires smart and attractive females depicted in foreign literatures (Irene Adler for example) and she thinks competent females more widely accepted overseas. 
She just doesn’t want to be alone ."

I realised I think too much about wanting to fall in love again that I felt so pathetic when I cant find love. But the truth is, the right person just has not appear yet. It takes time, opportunity and fate to meet the one who will make you fall in love all over again. 

So for those who are still single, stop trying too hard to look for it. Stop over thinking ""does he likes me?"" ""Do i love him?"". Instead, go for it if you feel that thats the one for you. If you never try, you will never know. 

I tried so hard to ""create"" fate by swiping on apps and chat with new people, but eventually, the one i fell in love, is not the one i swipe, its someone who walked passed me on a random afternoon.

1747,59444,"To #59298: I experienced the problem you do about society hating on ""smart"" girls. My ex used to be one of those men who believed that women should be helping men ""in the background""- we eventually broke up because he would get angry when I did better in school than him or like get on the dean's list and he did not. Even other women think like that, e.g. my grandma would tell me that if I study too hard guys won't like me. To make my ex happy I used pretend to be dumb and not answer stuff when I knew the answer, let him (and other people) explain things to me when I already get it, and hide away any prizes or good grades I got. 

But I've now found a guy who is supportive of me and I feel so much happier and comfortable in my own skin. Seeing the contrast, I now think it's better to be single and wait for someone who is supportive of you, than be attached but have to be someone you are not. Nobody should be rude and stuck up, but there is nothing wrong about being true to yourself and proud of your accomplishments. As long as you know you're not being rude to anybody or of bad character, then there's no reason to hide away your intelligence. If you want to find a guy who is supportive of your intelligence, all the more you shouldn't act dumb to attract the type of guys you are looking for!

If you don't mind acting meek or being deferential that's your choice, but just know that it doesn't have to be the only choice. People of our generation tend to be more modern, and I don't know whether this is true but I noticed that it was better with guys who studied overseas, or guys that appear 'nerdier'? Just try to expand your social circle and be patient. All the best!"

1752,59436,"Hi,
English is not my native language, but I will try posting this because I cannot take it.  I stay in PGP, and I am posting this here because the management still has not addressed our concerns despite our emails and writeins. As of this week, they have started locking up the seminar and study rooms after 11pm. We were not told or warned of this change, and it is very insensitive considering that now is the exam period. Me and my friends are left frustrated. Considering we pay hostel fees, and it seems inappropriate to revoke our rights to the facilities midway through the semester without any equal refund. This is not even the policy of any other residence, who locks up their study facilities right around exam period? (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). And by posting here, I hope that the management will realize that it is a big issue for us students and reverse their decision. Thank you very much."
1753,59433,"Just to add on to the smart girl saga. Frankly, it's obvious that Singapore society values intelligence over hard work. An example of this is closet muggers, who study for hours yet pretend not to have studied, all to give the impression that they breezed through exams on intelligence alone. And lots of people hate these closet muggers, but there's still a lot of them regardless.

Given this culture, I don't think that it's silly for the OP to feel angry at having her results attributed to hard work instead of intelligence. Yes, from a purely logical perspective there's nothing to take offence at, but from an emotional and societal perspective it feels like someone telling you ""oh, you're not pretty, but you're good at putting on make-up"". In the context of intelligence being more valued, it's denigrating her by straight out saying she's less intelligent and also saying that she's faking it in a sense. (Which I think also leads to higher incidences of impostor syndrome among girls).

On to the advice given. Here, the attractiveness analogy is again useful; telling her to value hard work instead or up her EQ, is like telling an ugly girl that ""looks aren't everything"" and ""oh, you need to try harder to find friends who treasure you for what's on the inside"". On one hand, this is correct, but on the other hand ... is it useful, or going to make her feel better? Yes society is toxic for over-valuing these things, and yes the way to cope is by altering one's mentality and values, but it's an uphill task, and such comments while well-intentioned do very little to help. Not to mention, implying that she's an arrogant bitch and that's the reason she can't find friends.

Fundamentally, the whole post is about sexism as it applies to intelligence vs hard work. Which is why I think the commenters telling her to stop identifying as a smart girl as just reflecting this phenomena. I've known literally dozens of guys whose main self-identified trait was smartness (and only some of whom were neckbeard-types), yet no one has ever told these guys that it isn't good to identify as smart. I guess the OP does sound arrogant by talking about ""guys who won't get all weird about me"" and her academic achievements, but if the post was truly about bragging, would she mention crying for a whole day?

Anyway, that's all I have to say. I've encountered a lot of what the OP talked about in my schooling and career, so it really struck a chord. I like to think that I've made my peace with it, but I wanted to add my two cents for other girls who are still going through it. I didn't have any of the problems she talked about in dating, but that's one area in which being gay helps :)"
1754,59432,"As someone who was single for a long time before getting into a relationship recently, I just want to say people should not spreading the idea that ‘people need love, that it’s a natural instinct for humans to find/ want to be with someone’.

It was so horribly pressurising to hear as a single person because you’re made to feel like you have to find the one (whether you want to or not). I hear it so often now and it still grated on my nerves. I was happy being single, it was just everyone else who didn’t seem to think I could be.

1783,59383,"Hello, I am an Australian born Chinese girl looking to move to Singapore and get used to the lifestyle here (perhaps even call it home). I’m looking to move here with my boyfriend who is actually a Singaporean who did schooling and army here and came to UNSW for medicine, I clicked with him because we shared many shared values (I’m basically a typical Asian piano and study nerd so you might think I’m the model child for the Asian parent) and we shared a passion for food. I introduced him to my parents and they approved, he introduced me to his international Singapore friends and accepted me as one of their own, everything is all sorted and I just graduated. He asked if he wants to come with him to stay in Singapore I decided why not, my parents approved too since he became close to them (he can speak Chinese in a fluent basis whilst for me I’m only semi-fluent while I struggle with grammars on and off, I’m better at Canto), he was such a nice boy who always nurtured and cared for me. But at the same time I heard the lifestyle is very different in Singapore? I made some international Singaporean friends, I’m pretty versed in Chinese culture whereas I celebrate the festives and take yearly trips to Guangzhou to visit my family, my parents instilled in me the sense to get a stable job to feed myself and future kids, but that’s limited as I grew up in Sydney all my life so I fear the struggles of trying to fit in despite meeting lovely people and all.

These comments reflect a wider social problem. Society says that girls are supposed to be dumb, helpless creatures who require an intelligent, strong man to control them & save them from distress. People are dumbfounded and even intimidated when they meet an intelligent girl. This is so bad that I know really smart girls who pretend to be dumb so people feel more comfortable around them which reinforces the stereotype that girls are stupid. As a smart girl myself, I have met so many idiotic guys who think that they are superior in every way and brush off my ideas.

Maybe I'm just salty or hurt, but I can't get the mental image of her banging him out of my head. I've tried dating a couple of girls afterwards but it never panned out because of this mental image.

To Ryan who commented under #59278: What's your point of making a comment like this? We made the choice? We chose to listen to our parents? Quit blaming others? Only know how to blame others for their situation? It's easier said than done. When you actually step into other's shoes, you will understand that it's easier than just putting the blame on 'victims'.

1795,59361,"The Human Anxiety about Love and Lust with Castration as a Possible Solution (and a serving of a rant about my love life lol)

Amidst all these sex and relationship posts we see at least once everyday, I also can’t help feeling anxiety probably like the most of us, in one way or another. As such, at times, I really envy asexual or some religious people who don’t have the need to be desired and not having to satiate carnal needs. Other times I’d be jealous at chads and stacys who can have it their way.

All these hormones and the need to do our primal duty as living things has made me wonder what this angst is all about. I mean there are already so much of us humans around on earth and I do have the slightest thought of sexually castrating myself to rid of this anxiety and could probably help control the population as well, which I feel probably other people should have the slightest consideration to think about and we could do ourselves a favour from overpopulating this planet of limited resources.

It’s just a thought that lingers around time and again. I wonder if I would be much more of a productive human being and be happier if I had no libido whatsoever. However, at the same time, due to the need and urge to be loved, I’m scared and I don’t want to do it also. I wonder if there’s also a temporary solution that might help my anxiety due to this “need” and experiment how life would be without this desire.

(You can skip the next part to the end if you don’t want to read my rant about my sad love life…)

My love life isn’t flourishing as what I dream it to be and wonder if I do get there, will my feelings change? Personally, I’m still kinda learning the ropes in dating and haven’t been in a serious relationship. Most of my few sexual experiences have been paid partnerships and I never had the luxury of having FWBs. I’m not particularly bad looking, but I have my limitations that do inhibit my sexual value, like my height, my racial/religious identity and mostly due to my cynical and passive personality. I do blame myself in not taking risks when I had my chances with girls, because I had been too nice and respectful. I can easily mingle with girls casually and things can go well really quickly. However, every time I will hit the wall with the intent of going to bed with each girl, as I had always been caught in a moral dilemma that I should be a gentleman, but if you want to play the game you must be the bad boy which I had always feared that might incriminate me or put me in a bad light among my friends. I probably just don’t know girls that much yet and I still need more practice to know when to do the “wrong” things at the right time, but I’m already getting tired of failing and fed up of being so close to home runs and harping over past failures. I had gotten advice telling me that I should just go for the moves anyway and try not to get caught and respect the girl if it goes too far. Just play it cool and move on if it fails. If I get rejected early on I can easily move on and on without it being a big deal.

I haven’t really given up yet, though I do get scared at the thought of falling into the category of an incel due to me cock-blocking myself by DLV-ing and giving girls the chance to say no (it’s their innate defensive mechanism). (If you’re trying to date, you should know these terms…) I hope the girl I’m chasing after now might cure or treat my anxiety, but I don’t know for sure. It might be a passing feeling, but I do know that due to carnal tendencies, I’ll always be insatiable to do the deed, whether alone or with someone. That’s why I’m still having this small thought of hormonal or sexual castration in my mind and be more productive in school, or life in general. I hate to admit that my pursuits and trying to perfect the game have affected my grades and social life. Maybe I don’t know what love is yet, so sex can be out of the picture? I should probably let nature take its course…

(End of love life rant)

Now I want to bring up and consider another point, and is kinda going off tangent, which might sound very radical and will offend some or most people, and it has been done in some countries. Pardon me if it is so, but I just want to know the general consensus.

Is it time for us to slow things down a bit as a species? We could probably stop all this complaining about lack of love and/or sex life and shit if we all just sexually lobotomise ourselves (maybe at least temporarily to try out) and strive to be more productive, with only the need to reproduce as a controlled maintenance of our species…

Is the traditional goal of life overrated and is it time for change? I’m just opening this up to an open discussion here. Haven’t thought about talking about this to anyone and decided and I want to share here discreetly for a start. It’s all a random blurb of my thoughts that I wanna let out and I welcome anything. (Not a philosophy student, but I prefer deeper concepts to address this situation in layman terms, if possible)"

A-levels only determine your university placements.

Your university only marginally determines your job placements, the most important component being connections.

I later realised that on those nights when he claimed he was tired and after he said good night to me, he was actually out with the other girl. This went on for several months until my gut feeling told me something was amiss and I confronted him. He then admitted everything to me. 

Basically he blamed everything on the other girl and victimised himself saying that he was coerced into the illicit relationship because the other girl was very manipulative. When I asked for a breakup, he threatened to commit suicide because he said he cannot live without me. 

I insisted on ending the relationship but even months after the breakup, he still continued to loiter near my neighbourhood.

This level of emotional blackmailing and manipulation is the worst. I cannot comprehend how can people like him be so selfish as to cheat, while claiming that he still loves me very much. I am so thankful that I am no longer in this toxic relationship.

Cheating on your partner is a really selfish act and you cannot imagine the extent of hurt and damage you will cause. The endless cycle of asking myself why it happened, and even blaming myself for it when it is clearly his fault. Up till this day, sometimes I feel insecure and find it hard trust people.

There are always plenty of temptations around us but it is about making the conscious effort to keep choosing your gf/bf over others. It may be easy to fall in love, but maintaining a relationship is never easy; it requires commitment and lots of effort. "
1821,59307,"To #59307, I’m not sure what gave you that impression of academia, but you’re sorely mistaken. Academia is no longer the ivory tower that it was before, during which academics had much laxer tenure requirements, much higher pay, a conscionable workload, and often, also stay-at-home partners to tend to their daily needs. To put things in perspective, what was required for tenure in the humanities several decades ago (a few decent publications, and sometimes not even a doctorate degree) is pretty much the minimal output demanded of a fourth or fifth year grad student today. For this reason, grad students and academics alike now suffer burnout, depression, and anxiety rates much higher than what ought to be normal. 

I don’t know which faculty you’re in, or which field you intend to pursue, so I’ll first say here that I cannot tell you, with full certainty, what to expect. I can only speak to experiences of academia in the humanities. But what I want to say is that it really is not easy. Sure, a PhD may take only five to six years out of your life, post-docs two to three, and then you’ll spend yet another six year vying for tenure, but in every step of the way is so much precarity. You’ll be writing applications over and over, and then pitches, grants and proposals (most of which, mind you, will get turned down), so progression through the ranks will take much longer than you expect. And of course, you’re doing well in school now, and you may expect to keep doing just as well. But remember that you’ll be competing with the best students and budding academics from top universities across the world. The truth is that there are far more qualified applicants than there are tenured positions at universities, so unless you’re deeply passionate about what you do, and willing and able to take the risk of devoting years of your life to something that may not eventually pay off (the phenomenon of “alt-ac” is becoming increasingly prevalent for this reason), you’ll very likely be better off in a cushy consulting job. 

I hope this doesn’t come off as condescending, but if you’re really serious about becoming an academic, maybe try to speak frankly to other academics and read up on the state of the profession first. There’s a reason why grad students and early career fellows (and even mid to late career academics) are leaving academia in droves. 

tl;dr: academia is tough af. If you want a nice house and a fancy car, get a job in the CBD instead. "

1824,59300,"To those lamenting about how good they will perform in an overseas university, I think you guys are far too arrogant. First of all, some of you actually had the chance to attend overseas university, you merely did not grasp the opportunity and decided to stick to local university for whatsoever reason. Yes, some of you are unfortunate that your parents cannot afford overseas university, than in which you cannot blame again as you are paying a cheaper price for your degree. YES, this world is P2W, the more rich you are, the further you can get in life. Secondly, you guys are not very smart either, if you guys were smart, getting first class should be an easy game even in NUS. Just because you got straights As overseas, that doesn't make you smarter. You are still mediocre as ever as you struggle to get A over here. Next, you guys should not complain about these ""poorer"" results jeopardizing your chances of getting a job or losing out to the peers that went overseas. What makes you think that it was precisely your result that cause your failure? In my opinion, it is your attitude that you guys have that result in it. There are millions of example where people with shit grades that went on becoming richer than the Lee family. The fact that you guys are relying on your paper qualifications to distinguish yourself from others is laughable. You are not products of a university, you are yourself and pretty sure the paper you hold amounts to literally nothing in contributing to the success you achieve in life. 

And before any of you tries to call me a hypocrite, I am not attending university for the paper qualifications. I am here to pickup a skill since my parents are able to afford it and enjoy whatever that comes along with it. I am fully prepared to dropout anytime and work full time at Starbucks if I have to.

1825,59298,"To #59298: I experienced the problem you do about society hating on ""smart"" girls. My ex used to be one of those men who believed that women should be helping men ""in the background""- we eventually broke up because he would get angry when I did better in school than him or like get on the dean's list and he did not. Even other women think like that, e.g. my grandma would tell me that if I study too hard guys won't like me. To make my ex happy I used pretend to be dumb and not answer stuff when I knew the answer, let him (and other people) explain things to me when I already get it, and hide away any prizes or good grades I got. 

But I've now found a guy who is supportive of me and I feel so much happier and comfortable in my own skin. Seeing the contrast, I now think it's better to be single and wait for someone who is supportive of you, than be attached but have to be someone you are not. Nobody should be rude and stuck up, but there is nothing wrong about being true to yourself and proud of your accomplishments. As long as you know you're not being rude to anybody or of bad character, then there's no reason to hide away your intelligence. If you want to find a guy who is supportive of your intelligence, all the more you shouldn't act dumb to attract the type of guys you are looking for!

If you don't mind acting meek or being deferential that's your choice, but just know that it doesn't have to be the only choice. People of our generation tend to be more modern, and I don't know whether this is true but I noticed that it was better with guys who studied overseas, or guys that appear 'nerdier'? Just try to expand your social circle and be patient. All the best!"
1826,59288,"I found out that someone I knew had possibly lied about her background. Her educational background and university graduation year don't match a typical university graduate, and when I typed her particulars and date of birth into the degree verification portal, there is no match found. 

I am so thankful for the degree verification portal for exposing people like her. I just can't understand why people would lie about their achievements, which initially I was very much impressed. 
She was from a poly and managed to make it to business, before switching to science related course after her first semester and managed to finish her course within 2 years, and during her studies, she managed to work full time in ICA. (Sounds extremely impossible and fishy). When I asked about her graduation year, she replied that she had forgotten it already. Her demeanor and behaviour doesn't seem like a typical university graduate, and I am quite certain that she have lied about her background. She goes by many different names on social media, work and real life, and I am wondering which is the real her. 

Hiring managers and people who worked in HR department before, what are some of the things that you will do to verify if a candidate is lying? If she manages to answer all interview questions easily, and her educational certificates were true, would you hire her? "
1827,59286,"Would love to start a thread here for NUS grads and how they are doing now. Maybe it’ll encourage the undergrads to look beyond grades.

NUS CNM 2016 grad here making 100k/year. CAP 3.4/5. Tag those who keep saying fass has useless degrees.. That said, I didn’t get what I’m getting now with the degree. 

Believe me when I say that the course does not prepare you for the working world, or finding a job. You have to figure out yourself the sooner the better. If you’re focusing on getting straight A, ask yourself if that’s what employers care about. Not once did any companies ask me about my grades nor course of study. So take a chill pill and enjoy your time in school. 

If you want to have a great career, go talk to people in the different companies you’re interested in and ask them what’s the best way for you to get hired. Of course you need to articulate your value beyond your grades. Talk to as many people as you can because some day they’ll need your help, and you will need theirs.

Looking forward to the sharing of alumnus from different faculties! :)"
1828,59281,"To all the year 1 freshies at NUS,

I was once a freshie like u and i would like to share my bad experience. I was victimised by a grp of 3 females who were close frens. It was an 'innocent' group project whereby we had to do it together due to the proximity of our sitting positions during tutorial. Randomly assigned by the tutor. They actually ganged up to fail me for peer appraisal. They gave me an average of 3 points out of 10. I approached my lecturer regarding this but nothing could be done cuz it is a case of 1 against 3. My overall grade for that module dropped as a result. I could hv gotten my A or A- but ended up with a B+. Screw u bitches! I confronted them and they did apologise to me quoting that they were too harsh to give me such low appraisal marks. They also admitted that they felt I was a threat so had to do it to pull my grades down. It was a pretense that I accepted their apology and we did many projects together, scoring all A and A- for them. Years after graduation till this day, I remembered and had not forgiven them at all. 

A word of caution: Be careful of who u do project with! "

I may be reading it wrong but she seems to be more invested in our relationship than I am. I don't know if my feelings will change, I do like spending time with her but how and when should I tell her how I feel? Isn't it quite fked up to say like ""oh I like you, but more like a friend and not in that way yet, but I wanna hang out and keep you around cos I think there's some potential here."" I don't wanna lead her on and I also don't wanna stop hanging out with her or hurt her feelings. Also what if she makes a move first, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret cos I find it very hard to say no to people and i'm a horny MOFO.

1834,59272,"To #59224, 
I'd like to think that's Im somewhat in the same position as you, or at least I've had some similar experiences to what you mentioned. It hurts to not quite fit in with society's expectation of the ideal girl, or the people who look for that type of person. And accordingly it's harder for people like us to find friends/romantic partners. 

Something i ask myself often (and could help you too) is what the point of ""fitting in"" is. I admit to conforming to get what i want sometimes, like playing up the shy/confused girl stereotype to get help in class, but to keep up such an act in friendships or relationships is ultimately terrifying to me. Why would i want to have friends/a partner who i can't be real with all the time? So yeah, maybe i scare people away at times and it's a bit harder to make friends (most current close friends report their first impression of me as ""intense"" or ""unfriendly"") but I just treasure the few friendships i have. 

(And it's definitely possible to find a guy who respects your intelligence, or maybe even likes you for it. Don't settle for playing a ""perfect girlfriend"" for someone just to be in a relationship because you'll eventually get unhappy anyway.) "

If I share about about what I'm reading, what I doing for my extracurriculars, and generally what I love, it isnt to brag or say I am better than other people.

1862,59224,"Hey admin, it’s the OP from #59224. Didn’t thought there are so many threads following smart girl post!! (Trying not to sound emotional, using 3rd person narrative below) 
Thank you all for listening to my story. The OP has been happily attached and has quite a lot of friends around her, she clicks well with those who shares the same passion or those she admires. To answer some of your questions, she is taking care of her appearance well as she was in charge of CCA fashion design department back in old school. 
However, she feels that sometimes there are definitely drawbacks for being unique, like many people can feel connection with you, but you can only connect with so few. She can speak a few languages, but it is very difficult for people to get a full picture of what she is thinking. She’s never a member of a girl clique either, due to skewed boy to girl ratio in her course and she’s more or less raised up like a guy, interested in history and maths. That fail in connection and constant losing interest in things other people like led her to negative thoughts and she was once keen to read through lots of  psychology books to find what was wrong with her mind. The reason why she said she could not be popular is that she could not keep small talks going.
She’s not perceived as the hardworking type either, but that is exactly what she was talking about. She’s seen girls who asked for help and attention given more credits than those who worked hard and chasing their own dreams, where hardworking and competency are definitely redeeming qualities!! She thinks it is a social phenomenon here (Asia in general) and wants to call out. As she admires smart and attractive females depicted in foreign literatures (Irene Adler for example) and she thinks competent females more widely accepted overseas. 
She just doesn’t want to be alone ."

1868,59211,"Is it reasonable for parents to order their children around? 

Last night, I told my parents that I’d be going for blood donation the next day, then mum demanded that I would not go for my appointment because I donate too often. Fact-check, last donation was 3 months ago. I resisted and insisted and explained that her reasons are ungrounded and purely based on feelings. Dad took her side. Things got out of hand because we’re all quick to anger... let’s just say there was shouting and hitting involved (they hit me). In my anger, I did say I will call the police but that only aggravated them, and I didn’t really mean it.

I know this is a petty thing to fight over. After calming down, I went to talk to them and explained to them it wasn’t that I am set on donating blood per se, it’s that I want to retain my autonomy over my own life, make my own decisions and walk my own path. To give some context, I am turning 21 soon. We established that things could’ve been handled better on both our ends. Me, the tone and expression; them, their quickness to react with anger. We also established that I could’ve overreacted when I sense my freedom being “threatened”. I know they had my health in mind, so I took a step back and rescheduled my appointment for another three months later (they think I should only donate twice a year at the maximum).

However, this morning, mum came up and said it was perfectly reasonable and normal for parents to give orders their children. She got angry again when I disagreed and said that I think that is untrue and unreasonable. 

There seems to be a big clash between my parents and I due to the difference in our world views and beliefs. I can never express my thoughts and opinions without meeting anger because anything misaligned with their narrow set of  their beliefs is not tolerated. They perceive it as disobedience rather than a discussion. I’m not getting the respect I think I deserve. I feel unheard and misunderstood.

What should I do to maintain the harmony in my family without entirely compromising on my own beliefs? Thoughts and advice would be much appreciated."

Out of curiosity, how can u guys/ladies get hookup when you're in Europe with Asian face and height?

I have done an exchange in Europe, and my general impression is 

1. European girls have no problem to meet new Asian guys, to have small chat...
   (I got 'much busier' Tinder in Europe than in Sg)

2. but when it comes to deeper relationship topic, or sexual/hookup topic, European women tend to be more conservative on non-european and less likely open the opportunity to Asian guy. They also prefer to stick with people from their own country (so this trend is NOT just for PRC!)

So for those who have been in a relationship/ hookup with European/Caucasian/American, what do you (man/woman) think?

1877,59186,"My girlfriend and I have been together for quite some time now, but recently I found out that she was cheating on me.
The reason I found out that out is when I checked her phone and her chat history, and found out that she was cheating on me the whole time. There were kinky messages, some saying “I miss your d**k inside of me” and some “I miss giving you bl**j**s”. When I first saw those messages my mind just went blank, trying to absorb all that happened. I tried to stay calm the whole time when she was with me to reduce suspicion. It felt like shit and I went crazy. I wanted to confront her about it, but at the same time I couldn’t as I didn’t have any evidence other than me checking her phone.
Over the next few weeks, I observed slowly and continued checking her phone from time to time and eventually found out the pattern.  Whenever she said she reached home, she was actually checked in to a hotel with the guy. It seems as well the guy knows whenever I was with her, and would not message her at that time. Sometimes when the guy buys her stuff, she would show them to me and said that it was given by a friend when I already know who it was given by
I know it was my mistake for checking her phone, but I feel that if I hadn’t I wouldn’t have found out all these that was happening behind my back. She did not show any signs that she was cheating on me, so I can’t use that reason to start the topic. Is either she was really good at hiding it, or she was just making use of me as she couldn’t be together with the guy. If I act rashly, it’ll just affect the whole relationship and make it seem like I was the one at fault when the relationship breaks.
I really don’t know what to do with this. One side of me is telling me to break up with her, another side of me is telling me to continue trusting her and she knows what she is doing. If I didn’t check her phone, I would never have known that she was cheating on me and we will still continue to be a lovely couple
Anyone has any advice for me to continue on with the relationship? Or I should just confess and break up with her?

1878,59185,"I finally understand why are there more and more otaku. 

Women always blame men for not being able to ""handle"" successful women.

While that women are more and more educated and self-sufficient, it's quite forgotten that the opposite is also correct? 

Forgive me if I am wrong but I don't think the society  moves positively for only one gender. That being said, a guy receiving a decent, lets say, 5k pay wouldn't want to put up for a woman who is ""always right""?

1880,59178,"‘If you leave me, I will kill myself’.

It took me some time to gather my thoughts to write this, as I didn’t want to be reminded of the painfully traumatic experience that I had to go through. I’m writing this to raise awareness for those who might be trapped in an emotionally abusive relationship yet have no idea what to do, because I was once in that position. 

My ex-boyfriend (let’s call him X) used to threaten suicide whenever he wanted his way in things. He wouldn’t let me hang out with my friends or pursue by own interests (like travelling). We had our own personal differences and didn’t seem like we would be able to work out in the future. Whenever I raised a breakup, X told me he would kill himself if I did break up with him. He resorted to sending me photographs of him at the rooftops of buildings attempting to jump, and him slitting his wrists. Every time this happened, I would apologise to him, relent and stay in the relationship because I was so afraid he would really take his life or harm himself further. This went back and forth a few months and it took a mental and emotional toll on me. Of course, I am not undermining the fact that X could have been struggling with mental health issues (depression and being suicidal etc), and I did encourage him to seek help if he needed professional help. He dismissed these claims and insisted he was mentally sound and would kill himself simply because he couldn’t bear the thought of me leaving him. I was very afraid to tell my family and friends, and I spent nights breaking down, wishing I didn’t have to go through his multiple threats time and time again. 
Eventually, my closest friends found out when they overheard my phone conversation with him, begging him not to jump. I was freaking out and that was when I spilled everything to my friends and they pointed out that X was being unhealthy, manipulative and controlling. 

In the end, after much thought, I did break up with him as it was far too draining for me to bear. I reasoned with X that this unhealthy relationship was making us both unhappy, and perhaps what we really needed was a time off from each other. He agreed, and we parted ways. The stress from the whole ordeal was overwhelming so after we broke up, I sought help from a therapist and she shared with me some advice on what I could and should have done.

1.	Call a support hotline to seek help for the person involved (e.g. Samaritans of Singapore)
2.	Speak to someone you trust about your partner’s death threats
3.	Remember that you are not responsible for your partner’s choices

I’m sharing this story because so many people I know (regardless of gender) have been once put in such a helpless and terrifying position because of their partner. Physical abuse is easier to pick up, but emotional abuse isn’t. Having your partner force and manipulate you into staying in a relationship is definitely a form of emotional abuse. If you’re going through something like that, you can try reasoning with your partner and learn why your partner is acting this way. If this persists, don’t be afraid to speak up and seek help! YOU DESERVE TO BE LOVED!!

p.s. There are suicidal people who are battling with mental health issues and I am not advocating for you to leave your partner/friend who has depression. Instead, learn to discern the difference between someone who is using emotional and manipulative abuse to get his/her way and someone who really needs professional help. I really hope this post helps someone identify the red flags in their relationship and raise awareness on emotional abuse in relationships!

It’s so frustrating when the other party is not putting in any effort. It’s so different from what I watched on porn. I mean I understand porn is exaggerated to some point and I can’t compare to it, but is this too much?

Some of my friends say if a girl don’t put in effort during sex, it shows she is a self centered person, is that true?

Has anyone thought about how humans are going against nature? By that i mean natural selection - survive to find a mate, and to reproduce.
In nature, we see that organisms that cannot find a mate eventually does not reproduce, and their bad genes are therefore not passed down the species evolutionary line. 
However, what modern humans are doing now is just defying that. 
Putting on braces, getting plastic surgery. These are some examples as to how human beautify ourselves so that we can look more attractive to find mates. All the ugly genes continue to get passed down and makes us human evolve much slower.

They can afford shopping trips like this, where I can clearly see that $100-$300 has been spent in one shot. Not over one month. $100-$300 IN JUST ONE DAY. Sometimes they even manage to include a nice manicure and a haircut, and one pampering session alone could total $100 plus IN JUST ONE DAY. So total damage is $500( yes, really) in a day.

Today, one of the senior staff blamed me for a few things, I finally fought back with some of my thoughts (and of course something that is not so polite haha)

Just want to share a really nice article (link at the end) that I came across right after that fight. It says 'Work defines us as people i.e. when we aren't happy at work, other areas of our life suffer. ' It really change my mind about the meaning of getting a job. 

Maybe all the time we are too realistic towards a job, about the salary, recognition from superior, career prospect and how other judge you on your career success, that we lost the things that we wanted to pursue. 

Let's stop judging on others' and our own job, so that we can find out the real happiness in our job.

I was pretty happy at first, but after I found out what all my SoC schoolmates were making, my confidence was shaken a little. I'm pretty sure I'm just mediocre and my starting was around average only. Why is is so difficult for people to believe that? Isn't it just simple market economy? When the demand is high, the price goes up. Today it's CS that's hot in demand; tomorrow it could be material science and engineering; the day after tomorrow it could be aerospace engineering (which NUS doesn't offer btw).

Hope to cycle more safely on park connectors cause I heard Singapore road drivers are pretty hostile towards cyclists. I stay around north east area of Singapore.

Just exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your call logs and grinning like a fool.

But I know the truth. That's just them being nice. Anyone nice to me is nice to others too. I always end up nearly forgetting that.

If the truth is cruel mistress , a lie must be a nice girl.

That's why niceness is a lie.

1932,59073,"I wanted to move on very long, but after what #59073 has written, it evoked my memories once more. TLDR, I am just a jerk who would like to thank someone who once appeared in my life and taught me to be a better person.

Hi F, I am not sure if you would be reading this, since I got to know you while I was exchanging and you probably wouldn't follow this page. I was not looking for a relationship prior to this and most of my encounters with other girls ended after a few lukewarm exchanges, until you showed up. 

Despite my carefree personality, I am a totally different person when it comes to work. Literally no smiles, dull and often the epitome of looking resentful. It was only I met you when I told myself I will be ready to settle and be less carefree, even if it means my lifestyle would change and I might have to relocate. Through my exchanges with you, I got to know you better. 

Through some misunderstanding, we drifted apart. I remember you for calling me over-sensitive when I try to break the ice with you once more. And I broke your trust by telling things that you confided in me because you trusted me. I am sorry for breaking that trust. It was you who thought me what is trivial to me may be important to someone else and it could well be a secret that is not meant for others to know, not even our mutual close friends. Subsequently another round of argument because of other things made me resolute that our friendship was gone, let alone for that slight possibility of romance which might have developed. 

You warmed up to me after that, all of a sudden. I remember I wasn't responding to the hints you made, repeatedly the whole night while we were out wth our friends. It must have been hard and embarrass for you to give so many hints and it's so obvious that our friends around us would have gotten it. Even after that night, you tried to talk to me, but I started drawing boundaries - replying less frequently, deciding to hang out lesser with you and probably you could feel that I wasn't as warm as I was to you prior to that. You continued to follow my IG stories and my posts and I knew that. I just don't know how to approach you and what were you after. I was just so sure that I might not be the one for you after all and our interactions just went to as good as zero.

Now that I am back home and whenever I play truth or dare, or when I have downed some alcohol, I will try to tell myself to not share with anyone this encounter. There are just too many ifs in the process. What if I did not share out what turned out to be your guarded secret? What if we warmed up to each other at the same time? What if I actually come and speak to you despite whatever that happened? 

The worst part is just when I thought I have put behind this incident, I realised I didn't. Whenever I started to HTHT, whenever I drink, I will be regretting over my mistakes. I just couldn't find anyone that would made me change myself for her again. I think that I only have myself to blame ultimately. Yes, I am a jerk, an egoistic man, behind a front that appears mature.

I heard from my friend that you have started seeing someone. I hope that the person will treat you better than any of the guys you had. I just hope that the next time we meet again, we will be smiling at each other and we could become closer friends, if I may. 

Thank you for reading such a long post. I am not sure if this is what they meant by the first love, since we never really started. Btw F, thank you for enabling me to grow up and to be more sensitive to someone else's needs and wants. And for others out there, you just have to talk to the other person if you really want answers to your questions. Don't be a jerk like I once was.

I guess it's time to move on at last. "

Even until now, my mom still frowns upon me if I hang out at my bf's place for an entire day. She still thinks that it's ""not nice"" and doesn't reflect well on my upbringing, which I find really ridiculous. My parents have always been against stayovers. I wasn't even allowed to stay over at my girl friend's place. On the other hand, my bf has always wanted his gf to have stayovers at his place, but I keep turning down his requests because I am personally uncomfortable with the idea (I have stayed over a couple of times though just to appease him). However, we have gone on overseas trips as a couple and I simply lie to my parents that I'm going with my bf and a bunch of friends lol. My parents would always ask for the contacts of the ""friends"" I'm going with and each time I give them the numbers of a couple of real friends who know my situation. What they don't know won't kill them. I know it's not a good thing to lie but I also know that sometimes, it's really hard to talk to parents about these issues. So if you find it difficult to open up to them, there's always a way to get what you want. Ultimately, parents will have an inkling of what their children are up to. It's just whether or not they want to probe into it. :)"

Of course we had arguments here and there but they were nothing major, I loved him like my life depended on him. He made me feel complete, happy. But 4 years into our relationship, we argued more often, especially when I was unhappy with him speaking with his female best friend every day throughout our relationship. Long story short and I don't want to relive this memory anw, he cheated on me with her. I definitely had some fault to play towards the unfortunate end of the relationship and I tried salvaging things by trying to become a better girlfriend, friend and I took him back because everyone deserved a second chance. But the cheating episode has never been out of my mind ever since, it has been consuming me inside out. I got so insecure, worried that he'll hit her up again, worried about other girls, overthinking everything. I was on the brink of suicide and my CAP flew out of the window. I did go for UHC's counselling and I felt better, but I guess when someone cheats on you, thoughts of ""why wasn't I enough"" ""if he claimed to love me so much, how come he didn't think of me when he did it with her"" ""what could I have done that could have prevented this"" ""all those times when he said he was busy, was it with her"" etc etc never goes away and up till now I have so much of anxiety and negative feelings towards most things. Anyway, we broke up 8 months later because he felt it was unfair for me to continue in this toxic relationship that was eating me alive. Even though its been 2 years since we broke it off, I miss him very much and I constantly think back to what I could've done better. But then on most days I curse myself for being an idiot, for allowing him to ruin me. 

What was supposed to have been something sacred turned out to be my ultimate ruination and destroyed whatever notion I had of 'love'. So to all of you out there who think cheating is fine or are cheating rn as I type this, please consider the feelings of your SO and break it off with them beforehand, whether its a simple fetish or power play that you like. Is this some millennial thing to be cheating on each other? After this whole episode, I can't move on. It's still at the back of my mind and I've been trying so hard to move on and keep myself busy, but on worst nights its here to haunt me like his best friend. It's really difficult so I beg you guys to reconsider whatever you're doing. Cheating has long term repercussions not just on your SO, but on you as well.

1948,59042,"Regarding the burning of joss paper, I feel that most of you do not understand OP's perspective and judge too quickly. 

I for one live in one of those areas with a lots of older generation uncle and aunties around, so the smog from incense and joss paper burning is inevitable every year, including recent weeks. I always close the window the minute I smell them, but problem is my room is the type that is facing West, meaning it faces the sun and absorbs all the heat, and somehow my family refuse to install aircon because of some stuff that old people believe that aircon is bad for your health. So at night it can get super stuffy and hot, and closing the window is just going to circulate the hot stuffy air in the room for hours. In which case it really is an inconvenience whenever the burning occurs, so I completely emphatize with OP.

However I do agree that it is a tradition kept by the older generations. Even most of the gen X (our parent's generation) do not practice it anymore. So in a way it is kind of sad that we're losing a part of the Chinese culture.

It's been years since we spoke or seen each other and the last time I saw you was in primary school.

We both made our mistakes and hurt each other. But primary school us barely even knew what we were doing–it was just some immature drama back then wasn't it? Funny how it seemed like such a big thing back then and in retrospect, it was so minor but blown out of proportion.

It doesnt mean the girl is cheating and ""withholding sex"", which btw is such a problematic term bc that's implying sex is some natural right you have and women must constantly give it to you. Their lower sex drive is not necessarily manipulation, and it's not necessarily cheating. 

Your gf doesn't owe you sex, and she isnt definitely having sex with hundreds of other men, bc have you considered that some people arent as desperately horny as you are? Maybe she was always low libido. Maybe it went down since she was younger. Maybe you dont wash your dick. Maybe she is turned off by your hyper-paranoid personality. Sit down and talk about it, you owe each other the benefit of the doubt, but no one owes anyone sex. Get over it.

4. No one gives a damn about your problems, be it relationship or personal problems.

5. Can't get a boyfriend or girlfriend? Then stay single. Getting married, having kids, and conforming to societal, moral, traditional values, are so old fashioned, obsolete, and such a liability, both financially and in terms of personal freedom and enjoyment.

1964,59016,"hey #58894, I agree with you? I've been in a long term relationship and recently I found out my bf cheated on me two years ago. I was heartbroken and shocked because he's like the best bf one could ever ask for. He's always been there for me, spending most of his time with me, saving up to buy gifts and making cards for me on special occasions, helping me with my schoolwork and housework when I'm tired, taking care of me when I fell sick... At first I wanted to just break up with him but I realised that despite the cheating, nothing has changed at all. What you said is right. To me, it's as if cheating has never occurred and life goes on as usual. I was sad only after I found out about it. All along he's been treating me so well and my family loves him too. I've been very happy and content with having such a wonderful partner and we were and still are very much in love after 5 years together. Is it necessary to pursue the matter now? Should I just let the matter rest since it didn't affect our relationship at all? Should I continue staying in this relationship?"
1965,59014,"To the OP of #58946

I for one understand you completely. The rationality behind our thoughts and feelings are completely unlike others, who are not in our situation, can understand. Firstly, I want you to know that your internal conflict is completely valid. Your feelings are your own and no one can berate you for it. 

Now, what can we do about it? You mentioned you don't see yourself marrying your current bf. Do consider this: Is this a result of your conflicted feelings for your new friend? Think hard about it and maybe you'll find more answers. These kind of soul-searching will take time. So don't pressure yourself to make such a hasty decision, only to regret it later. You'll only put yourself, and the people you love, through unnecessary pain. One other thing you should consider is, are you sure the feelings you're developing for your new friend are romantic feelings? Maybe you've fallen for the deep connection that you managed to build with him and not for the person. Then you might wonder, ""shouldn't I have such deep connections with my own bf and not someone else?"" well, you can think that way. But it's also possible to establish a connection this close with someone and not have a romance with them. The possibilities are limitless. Some people might think otherwise but, who says we have to fit what other people think?

Once you figured that out, I'm sure you'll be able to answer that question you have. I know it's a hard decision but I believe you can get through it. And remember, whenever you do decide to make that decision, own it. Own that decision. One day you'll look back and think ""maybe I should've done sth different"", but then remember that you did what YOU thought was best at that time. 

Ultimately, just slowly think through it. I'm personally still struggling, but I know my moral values. We can't always get what we want, but we can get somewhere close and still be happy. 

Wishing you all the best! "

By default:
Guys without fwb history date with girls without fwb history 

Guys with fwb history date with girls with fwb history. 
This ensures fairness. 

When “dating down”, ie. a person without fwb willing to date a person with fwb, the party with fwb should feel lucky and thankful that the other party don’t mind your past.  

It’s called “dating down” because people with fwb history have more LIKELIHOOD (not definitely, I know) of having undesirable traits like promiscuousity, STD and low self control and the other party needs to bear the risk. 

Similarly, when “dating up”, If the person without fwb don’t wanna date due to your fwb history, you shouldn’t feel insulted and call people narrow minded because your default pool should be people with fwb history anyways. You have more likelihood of undesirable traits compared to a person without fwb, what rights do you have to scold other people? Your default pool should be people with fwb in the first place anyways.

Even until now, my mom still frowns upon me if I hang out at my bf's place for an entire day. She still thinks that it's ""not nice"" and doesn't reflect well on my upbringing, which I find really ridiculous. My parents have always been against stayovers. I wasn't even allowed to stay over at my girl friend's place. On the other hand, my bf has always wanted his gf to have stayovers at his place, but I keep turning down his requests because I am personally uncomfortable with the idea (I have stayed over a couple of times though just to appease him). However, we have gone on overseas trips as a couple and I simply lie to my parents that I'm going with my bf and a bunch of friends lol. My parents would always ask for the contacts of the ""friends"" I'm going with and each time I give them the numbers of a couple of real friends who know my situation. What they don't know won't kill them. I know it's not a good thing to lie but I also know that sometimes, it's really hard to talk to parents about these issues.

1976,58998,"So begins the series of girls to avoid when considering a marriage or an LTR. 

This is going to trigger so many people. 

I’ll just want to preface it by saying, this is advice for guys. It’s raw advice. It’s not going to be PC. This is not a safe space for your fewlings.

If you disagree, refute with reason. Please don’t reeeeeeeee about it. It reflects badly on you and nobody benefits. 

Feel free to do a similar column for women. Everyone can compare notes and all can benefit. 

If you’re a guy and you want to get married ask yourself why. 

If you think it’s so that you can lock in the girl, then you obviously don’t know about no fault divorce. The girl can leave if she wants to and modern society and the courts have made it easier and even appealing to do so. 

If your do it for bto then I would ask you if a subsidised apartment is worth your freedom and your peace of mind. If it is, then go ahead. 

If you do it for religious reasons, I want you to have a good look at your religious text again. All the major religions do not specifically say that you should (as a man) get married. In fact, Jesus was celibate. Buddha left his wife and unborn child to seek enlightenment. They are more concerned about you being a good person than whether you got married or not. 

If you do it because your gf is getting older and she’s pressuring you. Then I would tell you to think why she’s in such a rush to get married. Marriage is insurance for women. Where you both pay the premiums and the payout is you. I would also advice you to get your balls back. 

The only reason I can think of is if you want your own biological children. Even that is fraud with danger as you can see with that paternity fraud confession earlier and the follow up attitudes. The kids, in the event of a separation, will usually go to your wife. So you have to be very careful about picking the mother of your kids.

1980,58992,"For about a decade now I have a rare condition that is called “Chronic pain” and mine has been described as particularly unfortunate, which I guess is just another way of saying bad. To put it simply, I experience pain which has no real cause. 

It started back when I was a teenager and it affects parts of my body randomly. Sometimes it’s just a light touch, other times I can’t even see straight. Prior to all of this for a decade I been doing martial arts and the suspicion is that something went wrong. Ironically due to the same martial arts I was actually quite accustomed to pain so I never really made a big mess out of it. The specialist that observed me even said that they are amazed by how well I tolerate pain.

I’m actually doing really well in my day to day life, I learned to hide in plain sight. I never tell anyone about it, I don’t want pity and frankly it mentally destroys people around you. Medicine doesn’t help either, it’s not like I haven’t tried, it’s just that after years of treatments I feel like there is nothing left to add.  

But there are times when pain overwhelms me. When I sit in the corner of my room unable to move, nights when I can’t sleep or mornings when I wake up completely wet from sweat. After moments like that, when pain shatters my mind, I often sit down in a shower and just wait until I am able to put myself back together. Although probably the most annoying part is when my legs start to hurt badly in public. Then I have to sit somewhere like an idiot being unable to walk and pretend that I’m just passing time. 

I’m probably writing this since another one of my relationships broke down and I’m feeling down about it. It was the same problem as usual – I’m insensitive. And I am, it’s just that from my perspective all these problems most people have seem so insignificant. Also, recently one of my exes, we remained friends, managed to stumble on me “passing time” virtually next to my apartment doors. She didn’t even ask what’s wrong, just sat there silently with me...

1989,58979,"Reply to Confession #58979

If you and your partner are roughly of the same age and earning the same income. I feel that it is a much better decision to make it fair 50:50 rather than getting the Male to pay more just because of social hierarchy. This is because your relationship will be a long term one and starting 'unfair' might become a source of conflict in the future which is something that you definitely want to avoid. But to be fair, I do not know of your situation and I do acknowledge some of the situation that might be alright to split 70:30 or 60:40.

1. Ask yourself this question, what are you going to use the rest of the money for when your partner pay more for the 'bigger items'? If it's personal items, assuming that male and female has the same basic necessities, aren't you just being unfair to him?
If you're using it under circumstances such as dental treatment, funding your little brother's school, etc (case on case basis) then you might want to talk to your partner to a certain agreement, but do be honest and remember that not all reason are actually 'valid'. Example is if you say you are funding your parents vacation, he also have parents and the arrangement will become unfair to his parents. So... the point is, really think through what are you going to use the rest of the money for before bringing this up to an 'unbalanced' arrangement.

2. What's the dynamic of your 'smaller items' payment? If it's all based on 50:50, I don't see why you should push the bigger items to other ratio. But if you have the tendency to pay for smaller items, let's say you cover electricity bill, dinner  etc. Then maybe it's actually alright because in the end it will be approximately 50:50 for what is covered by both of you~ 

3. If the guy is really okay with any arrangement, who am I to say? What I want to say though, a lot of couples went through this phase when the guys would not mind paying more for the girls and again, consider what will happen in the future. Based on your dynamics, can it be the reason for a crack in your future relationship?

Do take note that they're my opinion and I might miss some other possible cases. In the end, it really depends on you and your partner. I wish you all the best in your relationship~"

I might have been infatuated by you because you feels like everything i ever wanted but on a wrong timing. I always suspected you might have secretly crush on me by trying so hard and be my close friend.

However , because i am morally upright and attached. I tried to convince myself i luv u only as a close friend. My heart do waiver. Til now, i still miss you and thinks of you. 

Though both of us make no move further to be morally upright.


I think i had accidentally fall in love with 2 person. My gf and my close frenz. I chose my gf to be morally upright and left my close frenz.

The whole thing felt so messy. But the heart just doesn't heal....:'(

2007,58955,"Dear best friend, it has been years since we stopped talking. 

Ever since my jc years, you've always been the one I could turn to whenever I had problems. It was probably burdensome to you, but you dealt with it. I was a toxic friend to you. When you told me about that girl you clicked well with in your newfound job, I felt a strange mix of emotions. You have always been my ""strictly platonic"" friend but when you told me about her, about how she admired your codes, about how she understood you in a way I couldn't, I felt jealous. 

It was then I realised the root of my toxicity was not because I felt you weren't good enough for her (what I used to hurt you) but the fact that I caught feelings, and I didn't know what I wanted to do with those feelings. Ever had the feeling that someone was more than a friend, but less than a lover? That's how you were to me. 

You don't know how it kills whenever you asked me for advice to ask her out because I was, well, just a 'bro'.

I ultimately ghosted you because I wanted to move on, and I know moving on means I can't hold on to this platonish (or not) friendship. It hurt you deeply. But I'm glad things happened the way it did. I found out from a mutual friend that you are happily together with her. I have also found my significant other whom brings joy to my life everyday. Things had to fall apart for better things to fall together I guess.

I still don't have the courage to ask for your forgiveness for the way I treated you. But I hope you don't live your days wondering what you did wrong, because it was never about you. 

Happy birthday.

2008,58954,"With all the party girl, fwb, cuckold saga... I would like to change the topic.

It’s the time of the year again whereby so many people are burning incense and paper money. Every night, I can smell the choking smoke by these superstitious uncle and aunty all the way from my 18 storey study room. Come on... this is totally environmental pollution! You really think your ancestor can receive all the money you burn? We all turn into ashes after we die, no need more ashes from your paper money. 

I wonder who invented this superstition of burning things as a way to hail ancestor. It’s so pointless and environmentally unfriendly. 

Even if our ancestor really can receive the money, given the amount of smoke produced in the past 1 week, inflation rate will skyrocket in the other world. 

We should stop this pointless pollution! Who agree with me?"
2009,58953,"Genuine advice for all those asking about how much salary they should be getting: find out what you're worth, don't aim too high and don't settle for less. If you're a lazy bum with mediocre grades and portfolio, 3.5k starting pay is a real steal. If you're a decent student from a decent course, you should be aiming for a good 4k and above starting salary. Seriously though, the amount of salty people commenting about how 3.5k is already very good for a fresh grad and that we shldnt be greedy is too damn high. Get your head out of your ass people, and don't be so salty about fresh grads getting ""high"" pay cus some of them are really deserving. I have plenty of friends who are good at what they do, be it from business, engineering to computer science and have easily gotten starting pays of 5k or more. And I'm not even talking about the cream of the crop students with first class honours and a plethora of internship experiences, just decent students who put in effort during their course and proven themselves capable.

Only you know how capable you truly are and what you can do (unless you are delusional). And deep down only you know the kind of salary you should be getting. Just aim for this and you'll be fine. "

2014,58947,There was this girl I liked back in NUS. We started off as friends and slowly got closer together. We eventually dated for a while but it didn't last and we broke up after a while due to some conflicts and difference in opinions. During these few years we maintained an on-and-off friendship and talked occasionally. We both got attached and broke up with other people during these few years. But now I just realised I may still have feelings for her after all. She's all I could think of when I looked at happy couples getting engaged and married. She will always occupy a special place in my heart but I'm not sure she feels the same. I know it probably won't end well but I feel like I should give it a shot anyway. Any advice people?
2015,58946,"To the OP of #58946

I for one understand you completely. The rationality behind our thoughts and feelings are completely unlike others, who are not in our situation, can understand. Firstly, I want you to know that your internal conflict is completely valid. Your feelings are your own and no one can berate you for it. 

Now, what can we do about it? You mentioned you don't see yourself marrying your current bf. Do consider this: Is this a result of your conflicted feelings for your new friend? Think hard about it and maybe you'll find more answers. These kind of soul-searching will take time. So don't pressure yourself to make such a hasty decision, only to regret it later. You'll only put yourself, and the people you love, through unnecessary pain. One other thing you should consider is, are you sure the feelings you're developing for your new friend are romantic feelings? Maybe you've fallen for the deep connection that you managed to build with him and not for the person. Then you might wonder, ""shouldn't I have such deep connections with my own bf and not someone else?"" well, you can think that way. But it's also possible to establish a connection this close with someone and not have a romance with them. The possibilities are limitless. Some people might think otherwise but, who says we have to fit what other people think?

Once you figured that out, I'm sure you'll be able to answer that question you have. I know it's a hard decision but I believe you can get through it. And remember, whenever you do decide to make that decision, own it. Own that decision. One day you'll look back and think ""maybe I should've done sth different"", but then remember that you did what YOU thought was best at that time. 

Ultimately, just slowly think through it. I'm personally still struggling, but I know my moral values. We can't always get what we want, but we can get somewhere close and still be happy. 

Wishing you all the best! "
2016,58942,"So, what's love? Love is about sex, promise or companionship?
Well, I guess we already know the answer ourselves. Just that, we are often being ignorance to our own answers. Those who has been questioning regards their relationship here should question yourself and your partner what is the best solution for the both of you.

Question yourself will often prompt you to have critical thinking and often you'll come out the best answer for yourself too. So, need not to question here again. The only answer you'll get is just a confirmation of the answer in your heart."

2018,58940,"Been seeing a lot of posts and comments about how guys should never go for a party girl/ex-party girl and I can’t understand the stigma. 

I’m a party girl and I do hook up here and there, but that does not mean I have commitment issues or anything. In fact, I’d love to be in a committed relationship and give all of me to one guy. 

Maybe because I party very often, I only end up attracting guys who don’t want anything serious, or guys assume that I’m not looking for anything serious. I’m open to that too so I do go ahead with it if I like the guy, I mean I’m single so why not? But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want anything serious if it comes in my way. In fact, watching my friends who have boyfriends, I wish I could have something special with someone too. 

I party often because I love to dance, love the music, love dressing up and having a great time with my friends. So I don’t think me being a party girl should be reflective of how I would be in a relationship. I mean even if I am in a committed relationship, I do see myself going out to party just to enjoy the music and be with my friends. 

Really hope someday I can find someone who will look beyond my partying, because there is so much more to me than that. I hate to see it define me. "
2019,58939,"#58939

Girls, please do track down all past gfs of your current boyfriend before settling down with him.

Everything that you've heard about his past gfs has also been said through the filter of your bf. 

Males can, and will lie, blatantly or by omission, in order to attain your commitment before his (barely there) looks expire. 

Harsh view of females there huh, op of #58939? I like how you make it sound like only females indulge in such bs, while putting yourself and your species on such a high pedestal. Get off your high horse. 

Even if you do look up all her previous bfs, the 'truth', so to speak, will differ from person to person depending on one's POV. Does it invalidate what your gf said? No. You have to be able to discern what is opinion, and what are true lies. 

If you really want to do what you said in your post, feel free to do so. But do NOT put down the entire female race like that, as if males have never committed such acts. 

If your past gf wronged you, then know that she's the one in the wrong and don't generalise. Otherwise, know that both males and females can do that but doesn't mean that we WILL.

However, I am quite insecure with her knowing all about my finances. I am planning to open a secret account to put a portion of my money inside without her knowing. In this way, I can safeguard my money in the event of a divorce. I mean, who knows right, a happy marriage can turn sour  very quickly.

2022,58935,"I’m your typical guy from engineering, wearing SSS and my NS glasses to class, basically a nerd. One day, my army buddy had his birthday at a chalet and invited the whole section and that was when I met her. She didn’t really come across as my type. She had a small but visible tattoo at her thigh and her hair had streaks of neon green. My staunch Christian family, especially my mum was the kind who would frown at such people and call them attention seeking. Anyway, during the party, my buddy introduced us and that was when we realized we were both from NUS. Of course, nothing much materialized within those few hours, we didn’t have anything in common and just talked a little about the modules we were taking. As I was about to leave, my friend asked if I could send her home since we both lived around AMK and she was a little tipsy. On the drive back, we didn’t talk much, and I just dropped her off at the bus stop as she requested.

The next time we met was in the following semester where we both coincidentally joined the same planning committee. Throughout the sem, we had to work together, usually late after school and that was when we became closer. I found out more about how she lived in the rental flats and was embarrassed the first time I sent her home. She didn’t really come from a normal nuclear family and her father was in prison for drugs. As we got closer, I realized that I slowly started to fall for her despite her wild appearance. This was a girl who despite all the odds, still made it into a university. Despite her financial status, she was still buying gifts for her friends. And despite whatever life threw at her, she stood up strong and fought back.

We got together three months later, and all was well. However, after the first time we had sex, I just asked for fun whether she was a virgin and that was when my world crumbled. Of course, what a dumb question you must be thinking: but here I was hoping that I would be her first. When she told me how she had done it with her two previous boyfriends, and a fwb, I honestly felt disgusted and angry. As a guy, because of my ego, I felt a little ashamed of her and that I was using ‘used goods’. We argued quite a bit over that and within months, we broke up. 
The next year, my cousin got married and held his wedding at Amara Sentosa. As I was eating, I noticed a familiar back and when she turned around, that was when I recognized her. I couldn’t really tell what made me do it, but I then decided to walk up to her. We talked for a little and I realized she was working as a banquet server just to earn some pocket money over the weekends. We decided to head outside to talk and that was when we realized that we really missed each other and got back together.

I guess I am writing this out now because of all the recent posts on non-virgin girls, fwbs and what not. To the guys, I understand how you feel, I was there before. A nice unopened package, who wouldn’t want that right? Compared to the ex-party girls who simply are there for the fun, who have no character, no morals, no sense of shame. But let me tell you, that’s not what love is. Love is putting the other party before yourself. Love is when she stays up late just to wait for you to go home. Love is when there is a bowl of chicken soup in front of you when you are sick. Love is squeezing your hands tight when you nearly trip. So, to the boys out there, don’t narrow down your pool of girls just because of how they look, or their behavior in the past. 
Last week, she said yes to me. Give them a chance, and maybe you will give yourself one too. I love you XY.

I’d just like some advice. So I’ve graduated from a specialised course (not going to specify, but think along the lines of courses like medicine and dentistry). Majority of new grads become general practitioners or dentists, but I’m not exactly keen on these kind of jobs. I know, people will say things like ‘then why did you sign up for such courses in the first place?’. Well, I initially thought being a medical practitioner was for me, but after years of studying and internship, it isn’t. And honestly I’ve been delaying job searching because I’m just dreading working. I will be seeing a career counselor soon, but thought I’d like to hear advice from you guys about other possible career options (I’d like to have a relevant career as I’m done with studying for the meantime), or from seniors who were also in the same boat.

2029,58922,"With all the recent posts about party girls and people bashing them, my two cents is as follows:

Deciding to party or not is an individual's choice. If that person decides to have one night stands or FWBs, it is entirely up to that person. However, when they decide to get attached, you have to be truthful to your BFs/spouse. It is up to the guys if they are willing to pursue the relationship. Some are ok and some are not. If you decide to hide and it comes to light in the future, it can wreck your married life. It is always better to be truthful to each other from the start. The same goes for any health realted issues or even having an abortion before. For many, not being a virgin/ being a party girl might not be an issue. 

All the nonsense about carrying your secrets to your grave is messed up. Firstly, you don't know that it will remain a secret forever. Next, it is also messed up hiding something you did for your own benefit. "

2036,58903,"I hear many stories from friends and acquaintances that their parents are just waiting for them to graduate and start working so they can finally retire and relax. 

I don't know how I feel about that, really. I love my parents very much and I want them to enjoy the remainder of their lives in peace, comfort and stability. 

But to keep harping on retirement and our filial obligated to them often makes me feel as if I'm just an economic instrument...

They have provided me with all they could have - an existence, food, shelter, security and occasionally affection. I'm endlessly grateful and indebted. But I believe that I have also tried my best to be a good child for them - do most of their chores, clean up the house, cook their meals and on top of all that - do well in school so that I may (or not) have a stable career. 

I just feel as if all my contributions to this parent-child relationship is invalidated cause I'm not the sole breadwinner for all these years. I know its really exhausting to work and support a family but I hope my parents can see my struggles (especially with the competitive workforce and school) and that I'm trying hard to provide them the best life, but they have to learn to be self - reliant too. 

I am willing to give them a huge portion of my salary and spend little on my own, but I hope that they will be prudent and thrifty when the time comes. 

Retirement is an individual responsibility, a social security and a family obligation. To rest the funding of decades of retirement squarely on your children might be unbearable for them. 

In the future if I have children and they have ""officially"" entered adulthood and start claiming their own paychecks, I will continue to work until my body fails. I will work for a meaning in life, work to maintain social connection, work to feel useful, positive and relevant. I could work less than before, but nonetheless working still. I will work for my financial independence and try not to rely entirely on my children, thereby risking poverty if they don't provide. Of course all this is based on the assumption that there will be work for me. 

I will be frugal and read, write, stroll in parks in my free time and engage in economical activities instead of wanting to roam far flung corners of the world. I will meditate, find my spirituality and continue to focus on the struggle to reconcile with the notion of impending death. 

I know that one has spent so much resources on raising their children at the expense of their own welfare - but the money, time and energy spent cannot be seen and written as a debt in official IOU. Your children has also brought you joy, happiness, companionship and pride which you bask and indulge in when you return home from work.

Given it's a structured 10 week internship programme, and I don't want to assume the worst but it does appear that there is an additional opportunity for discrimination in the hiring process. If you're not able to commit to the entire internship for one week because you need to serve, does that mean you are a terrible candidate who gets disqualified even getting to an interview? Even when both advance to an interview, you have two equal candidates, and the employee knows one has ict of two weeks and the other doesn't, it's pretty obvious to the employer to reject the applicant with ict? In such a scenario, is there any realistic way you can seek fairness without blowing up your chances in the industry in future?

For small startups, I can see why they might shy away from potential interns who can't commit for the full period because of ict (because the presence of the intern may be much larger), though it's still not the way to treat those who serve imho, but if large companies are doing likewise it does seem to betray the fair hiring practices and meritocracy which Singapore strives for. Given how our education system is encouraging students to do more internships at an earlier stage, if this discrimination is not fixed those who served are going to be left at a serious disadvantage if they're looking to enter the private sector. In the wake of everything which has happened over the past month, beyond just talking about recognising the efforts of those who serve, are we making any progress to remove the discrimination faced by them?"

2055,58865,"I have been recently reading a lot of vile and misogynist posts( supposedly by guys) about ‘party girls’. As a guy I would like to give my 2 cents -

1. For those who are using the concept of so called ‘sexual market value’ need to stop reading all the pick up artist junk that has originated over the years in the USA and uk. If you think that provides any insight into women, I have a bridge to sell you and you need to seriously start questioning your education and whether your money is better spent there or sorting out your issues first with a counsellor.

2. Congratulations on realising that girls can be complete *ucktards too, that they also have desired, feelings, fantasies and a dark side to them. But maybe you should think about why you had such an idealistic, highly conservative and essentially dehumanising view of girls that they have failed to live up to? 

3. Now here’s a really juicy one, girls pay attention. Are you angry and jealous because girls can easily get attention and romantic company and sex and a buffet of guys lined up by just wearing a nice dress and putting on make up or simply because the female form is so eye catching by nature? Are you afraid or frustrated by this sheer power bestowed upon them by nature that  makes you at once feel lustful and inadequate so you put it down as soon as you encounter it?  I know it does and that’s why you don’t like those party girls so much. All of us straight guys have these feelings but we don’t act upon them by denigrating the other gender and calling them by pejoratives. We either brush them off or try to understand them to come to terms with them.  
And anyway I’d bet you a thousand dollars that if you were a ‘party girl’you’d do the same! You’re just jealous that you can’t.

2056,58863,"After a few years in NUS, I'm still somewhat out of place within my cohort. 

Perhaps it's my social skills which shun people away, but what most don't know is that I have an underlying mental condition. 

I've tried so hard to fit in but I don't have the energy to continue anymore. Some people think I'm some ""arrogant"" person focused on academics, but that was never my intention and I gave up trying to change that impression.

I recently left my CCA and isolated myself from most of my cohort. I do volunteer my time for certain causes, but I typically don't share it with most people - perhaps if I did I could be perceived as ""less arrogant and selfish"" but it's an extremely personal thing to me.

The reason why I need to focus on my grades so much is because that's the only thing I have to survive in the working world - by being hardworking. It's extremely demoralising to be rejected for so many internship positions despite having similar CAP and capabilities than others simply because of a mental health condition (it's quite easy to tell from the interviews).

I'm also a TA for some modules in NUS. Not sure if the professors who took me on are aware of my mental health condition (NUS has an official record). My students look up to me like some expert guy who has things going smoothly in life, but I'm very afraid that their whole impression of me will be gone if they found out my ""dark secret"" and I would be fired.

I do have a tiny handful of friends, though most of the time I feel like a burden to them. I heard that most people say that university is the best time to make friends - unfortunately I'm failing terribly at it. 

I've been seeing the school counsellor for my condition but I'm not sure if it's helping. I just really need to get this off my chest somewhere as I'm literally about to have another breakdown again.

I do have a question for professor Ben Leong (or any other professor who is active here): does NUS allow students with mental health conditions to be TAs? I do have a relatively decent track record of teacher ratings >= 4.5 / 5 if it helps.

Posting here may be a bad idea as eventually my identity might be traced. If I do lose my position, well, I'll just take it as a harsh fact of life."

Let me tell you why 28 for a guy is too old.

In general, decent guys start having sex at 19 (party guys may start even earlier). At a general rate of 1 new partner a year, that means a count of 10 unique vaginas by 28.

That’s a double digit body count which is unacceptable to most girls! And we’ve not even accounted for one night stands and non penetrative “it doesn’t count” sex. 

Also, the more times the sex, the lower the quality of the sperm.  

Guys who finish and close factory before 28 usually can maintain quite well. If your man only starts at 28, by the time he’s done you can kiss your sex life good bye.

What you will have left is finding it hard to conceive because your guy has too little or low quality sperm.

That's when you realize that party guys and party girls both shouldn't receive any judgment on their sexual lifestyle, and it really is none of your business. Frankly, you sound really really ludicrous. I wouldn't mind dating a party guy as long as they're checked and clean. What matters is really what they are deep down.

Justifying fwb and promiscuous acts
Justifying hiding abortion from guy
Justifying letting husband raise other man’s kid

Not only does the anonymous posts justify these act, a lot commenters actually also tolerate these ideas. 

Education has imbued you girls with reasoning, arguing and critical thinking power. But sadly at the expense of moral compass. 

An analogy would be a girl is given a gun. But whether she use the gun to protect her country or murder her neighbor depends on her moral compass and value. 

Similarly, education has imbued you girls with arguing and rationalizing power such that you can spin black into white and white into black if you try hard enough or try hard enough to see from a different perspective. 

Being able to justify fwb, partygirl or literally anything in the world merely shows how intectual, well educated and shrewd you are. But it’s the moral virtues and Chinese 美德 that ultimately determine which side you will take.

And I am expecting that girl are gonna use their intellect to critic my post too, arguing that virtue and value mean different things to different people, blah blah blah... I can only urge you girls to step out of the intellectual and argumentative realm and introspect about your own principles.

Remember, birds with the same feather flock together. If you like to sleep around and being promiscuous, only playboy and fukboi will flock to you because like attract like. I highly doubt you two can live a stable and loving life till old age with this kind of fundamental value.

Really, any guy who is a victim of paternity fraud in today’s age totally deserves it. 

Secret paternity tests are so widely available. You just need to swab the inside of your cheek and that of the child in question, then send the samples back to the lab and you’ll get your results. 

Worried about mistakes? Then use multiple labs to verify. 

You don’t even need to let your wife know. 

If the kid is not yours, I think there’s a clause in the women’s charter that allows for annulment. 

Usually the woman know who the real father is but he’s usually some deadbeat loser that’s not as rich and caring as you.

2081,58820,How to know if a girl likes u thru text?
2082,58819,"Long post ahead. 

It’s been 16 years since we got together, 11 years since we split up for the first time, 10 years since we got back together and 8 years since you left me without telling me why. 

Not knowing why caused me a lot of distress. I created 101 reasons for why you left, mostly excuses for you and doubts about myself. Perhaps I wasn’t good enough, perhaps you found someone else, perhaps I was too boring. Back then, despite not having closure, I told myself that I needed to move on. Life is not just about you and I. There are many other people who care about me.

I am very lucky to have met my significant other (H) who is patient and loving, and somehow managed to put me back together. I was in so much pain that I could not talk about you to anyone, including H. With time, I subconsciously buried you somewhere deep in my mind. 

When we ran into each other again a few months ago at a friend’s wedding, you me and H were seated at the same table. Except for one or two birthday or new year greetings I sent, we hadn’t been in contact for the last 8 years. Yet, by a twist of fate, we ended up sitting at the same wedding table at the wedding of a friend who did not know that we knew each other. Needless to say, it was awkward. I wondered if you can still see the hurt and pain you left almost a decade ago. 

I don’t know why but I felt the need to connect with you again. I wanted to know how you’ve been. I needed to know that you are well taken care of by someone... that you are happy. A part of me still care about you deeply. 

We met up, joked around for a bit. You suddenly asked if I wanted to talk about the past. Why not? I’ve moved on and am in a loving relationship, almost getting married. You said you are sorry. That you could not come to terms with your sexual orientation then and could not talk about it. Even now, you cannot accept who you are.

At that point, I felt: 

- relief: you left not because I wasn’t good enough 

- anger: I could not go about my life for at least three years after you left because I didn’t know why... I believe I must have been depressed 

- sorry for you

After that meeting, old memories flooded my mind. Snippets of our times together, pain from you leaving... I started feeling the pain I felt when you first left. It’s like all those emotions that I’ve locked up somewhere as a defence mechanism of my survival instinct were suddenly unleashed. I texted you about random things in hope that all these would go away. It got worse. I started tearing when the memories came back. I texted you about things that happened between us in the past, hoping that that would help me process it. Unfortunately, that made you uncomfortable, you said you didn’t know where this was going and our conversation terminated again. 

On hindsight, a few random thoughts:

- delayed processing of emotions is extremely unhealthy, do not let this happen to anyone you break up with 

- we didn’t make it because you could not accept yourself for who you are... we were doomed at the beginning 

- in a weird way, what happened between us, made me appreciate H more 

- People are divided about whether lovers can become friends. I think yes, if there isn’t too much hurt and pain. While I wish the best for you, it seems I’ve been conditioned to feel pain when I see/think about you. One day this may go away... I don’t know when

- I don’t know why but I want you to have someone too... so that you are no longer lonely and drifting around "

The whole point of my post is that cheating on your spouse is bad, but since it's done and there's no way to undo it, with horrible consequences for the child if you confess and no consequences for the husband if you don't, the most ethical thing to do is to keep it secret forever.

They don't realise the fact that whatever they do, it's not going to work unless the senior management changes its mindset about certain stuff. 

First, many of the senior management people, and I mean many, will ask this question when they see a hoobae, meaning a subordinate or younger employee leave the office early. Eh where you going. So early go home? Look, if that person already finished his or her work, and there are no more tasks to be handed to them, why can't they leave? Sit in the office and warm the chair is it?

Second, lunches. Omg let's have a department lunch. Let's have a group lunch. Whatever. I just want to watch my Korean drama or listen to my music in peace and eat. Just leave me out on your lunch. Lunch is me time. I don't want to have to face my superior again when I'm having lunch. 

Thirdly, if you really want to change, see if you can achieve this. Your office allows ppl to communicate from one end to another by shouting. Or allows subordinates to listen to soft music or radio and white noise. And let's not see anyone bringing in lunch to sit at their tables and do their work.

Im currently an SMU econs undergrad. Just completed NS. I am thinking of switching to NUS FASS econs. Now, I know that locally, SMU econs is more favourable.

If he really doesn't want to be friends with me anymore through his one-word replies then I might as well just stop this friendship and be by myself, which I'm completely comfortable with, because I despise the idea of him being friends with me just cuz he's pitying me.

She was really pretty but something was always off about the way she looked or just her actions in generally. I could never put a finger on what it was.

There comes a time in every relationship where you ask yourself whether you should be moving to the next step/base. So we decided after 6 more months in to sleep together. No sex but just cuddling. Of course, as with every guy, you WILL get erect. No matter how non-sexual you think it would be. I made the decision then to move my hands down. Unfortunately, my hands hit something odd and she winced. Broke up there and then.

Stared into each other's souls
The demons, the angels, even the ghouls

Everywhere they were seen together
They formed the strongest emotional tether

Threaded the path this world unknown
Only to figure who's upon her throne

Let saints and devils hear his cries
Let monsters inside numb the demise

All the memories buried deep within 
He promises to safeguard them, from friend or kin

Because in this heart she'll always belong

If a someone isn't right, stop trying, really. If you can't get a date, perhaps it's something you're doing wrong, seriously. Go and broaden your horizons and just go out with someone, like lunch dates, etc. At the very least, you get more friends and your social circle widens, increasing your odds.

The problem is that everyone holds too many expectations of each other. Stop it, nothing should be done only for the sake of relationships. For all my gamers out there, it's like AoE fam. Hit everyone and then go for the one you think you can score with.

I am interested in one of my project groupmates. The project has ended and I have no idea how to proceed from here to know her better. Some options I have considered:

1)Talk to her about schoolwork, and proceed from there (I'm taking the module with some friends, so it's very odd to use this as a conversation starter.)

2)Random small talk (Also odd considering that I haven't talked to her for about 2 weeks or so.)

3) Go straight to the point : "" I think you're cute and I'd like to know you better."" ( Tried before on someone else, got her number, but didn't work out in the end)

Whatever I choose to do in the end, proceeding from then on is difficult because I'm horrible at chitchat. All my previous experiences failed because of that (At least thats what I think happened).

You mentioned about nerdy look, acne prone face etc etc. How much effort have you put into improving your appearance? It's easy to blame it on others like ""why y'all so superficial cannot appreciate my inner beauty"" but what's tough is to realise that we are in full control to improve ourselves. 

Boobs wise, I have no advice but maybe you can try push up bra or use padding. That's how most girls get the 'big boobs'. 

Acne wise, go try out different product or research on how to improve skin condition. Visit dermatologist or tcm or worst come to worst can follow make up tutorial to conceal those acnes. Sometimes, it's linked to your diet also.

Nerdy look, this is really your fault man. I have a bigger sized female friend and let me tell you she's the most fabulous girl I have seen because she put in effort to dress up and you can see how confident she is.

2123,58758,"I am in the midst of a shaky relationship and learnt that trust is something that is very difficult to regain after losing it. I met my current gf on an app and we got together as she was attracted to my qualities of being clean, hardworking and most importantly morally upright. She always held that impression of me until 2 months into my relationship, she changed upon certain old text messages in my phone of me soliciting services from prostitutes before I met her. She felt disgusted and cheated by my portrayed good boy image, and the worst of all, I transmitted a disease to her. Thankfully, we went to the doctor and realized that it was just a bacterial infection that spread, and we were both negative for other big sexual diseases. However, this did not make my act any more forgivable as she is an innocent girl who practiced abstinence and did not deserve to get any disease or feel unclean. Right now my relationship is in an awkward state where no words can regain her trust for me and despite her pressing desperately for a solution, I simply couldn’t provide. So to everyone out there, I guess my message to all of you is 1) when you decide to commit to your partner, make sure you come clean with your past and take actions to show responsibility. I.e. taking STDs testings etc. 2) For singles out there, I know it might be hard to control your urges, but abstain from visiting prostitutes or getting involved in any crazy hookup culture, because that moment of pleasure might lead to many more regrets and complications in the future. I am lucky to not get infected with any STDs but I am sure we cannot be lucky forever, as they can spread from skin to skin contacts, broken condoms and anything."

2133,58746,"I don’t think girls are appreciative enough of the risk guys take towards their feelings when they flirt with her and ultimately get rejected. Girls, I hope you realise that the reason guys seem so desperate is that they know intuitively that even if he puts in all the effort and does all the right things, it will be extremely rare for a girl to ultimately ask him out on a date. This behaviour has been blogged about by ok Cupid as well as noticed by so many people on tinder. Girls simply do not take the initiative and I think it’s high time they are called out for it. I personally over the years have changed my stance when it comes to dating. I no longer date girls who don’t put in atleast as much initiative as guys generally do.  And it has worked pretty damn well. I met some brilliant women and have had great relationships with them. They introduced me to fascinating subjects I knew nothing about or advised me on how to improve myself and my social standing.  They helped me to get over the ‘girls are always victims and can make no mistakes’ syndrome that is so prevalent in society and how many girls either take advantage of it or are simply quiet about it in case they  lose their privileges. About how many young women are very aware of the sheer power of their looks and have a very poor sense of when it is and isn’t a good idea to use it.  So I urge guys to stop promoting such behaviour. Have some self respect and let girls know that you aren’t an idiot who can be taken for a ride and  demand they be more respectful of your feelings. Start actually treating them like a grown up who is responsible for their actions towards others "

I wonder why is it so difficult to build a rapport with my colleagues. I have been trying hard to join in their conversations  but I can't seem to find a right way to do so because most of their topics do not align with my interests. They talk mostly about overseas trips, Starbucks, and other very expensive things and activities that I have not experienced before. I'm from a poor family, since young, I did not have the privilege of going overseas, enjoying Starbucks, etc. I studied very hard, hoping that I could provide a better life for my family in the future. As a result, I led a sheltered life, I spent too much time on my studies and working part-time sometimes, which probably explains why my life is so boring to the extent that I always have a hard time initiating conversations with others because my life is only about studying and working- what else can I talk about?  I do have close friends outside, fortunately, they share common interests with me and I enjoy talking to them. What people do not realise is that I do enjoy making friends, and when I become friends with them, they will get to see a different side of me- I can actually be very talkative and funny... Unfortunately, I only present this side of me to people whom I feel comfortable with. I have tried initiating conversations with my colleagues but they did not last long, and most of the time I felt so fake and pretentious. Honestly, I just want to enjoy my job and being myself...

If you are wise, you won’t stake your relationship (which is one of the most important thing in life) against this potential danger.

2152,58714,"There's this pretty driven girl that I know of who is currently under NUSSU, but it seems like she is overwhelmed by what NUSSU has thrown at her so much that she has little time for herself and for me (one of her best friends). She is one of the new members so like the people who ran against the old NUSSU people (I think??) and she's just really popular coz she's sincere and she helps everyone.

I wanted to complain coz I don't think NUSSU does much at first yet took up so much of her time, but I saw her scope of work and it is MAD. She holds a key position and as a result has more work than usual, but like she sleeps so little and works so much she barely has time for anything else. I feel both sorry and angry that it should be this way coz I want to spend more time with her and also want her to get the rest she deserves? Her meetings end at 4am and she turns up for early classes looking like a zombie 

Is there anyway I can convince her to drop some of her commitments to take care of her health or is that too selfish?"

2154,58709,"Came across several posts on ex-party girls, I'm just here to share my experience and this is in no way indicative of everyone. 4 years after graduating from NUS, I started dating my ex fiancee. My family is traditional and parents were anxious about my relationship. I also thought it was time to settle down as I have worked very hard in the past few years and my career has progressed well. Got to know her on cmb and continued dating. She was nice, bubbly, energetic and interesting while I have always been, I guess, the more boring one as I have always focused more on work. So it was really a great time for me dating her. We were both of age and the topic of marriage came onto the table pretty quick after a couple of months. She told me  she used to be wild when she was in college but she has since changed and wanted to find a good husband to form a stable family. I didn't really mind despite having never visited clubs and having grown up in a more traditional family. I mean, come on, it's a 21st century. And honestly, love is an interesting thing and the thought of embracing her despite whatever the past she has had made me felt we were closer and I didn't even bat an eyelid in saying ""I really don't mind"". A year after we started dating, we got engaged and we started to plan for weddings and everything. I did most of the work in the planning, also settling the house in the process. But things quickly went south a month before the actual wedding. Guess there were signs before that as I was doing most of the work for both of us. I noticed that she started going absent on chats for long periods of time and started working overtime more and more and couldn't be contacted during those time. It came to light when I noticed suspicious messages popping up on her phone when we were out for dinner. Questioned her about it, and she broke down, admitting that she cheated on me with one of her ex fwbs who came back to seduce her, meanwhile saying she felt lonely with me sometimes as I focused a lot on work and am not as interesting as other guys she had seen before. I asked her why she would still go on with me in that case since I have always been that way since the first day we met as I told her from the start that I have never been that much of an interesting person. She told me she was eager to find a good and stable guy to settle down as all her friends were settling down and she didn't want to be left behind, but she couldn't help but miss the fun she used to have. Sigh, it was a big mess and we are no longer together. I guess what I learnt from the whole experience was that, it doesn't quite matter what each other's past is. What matters more is once you made a decision to change, stick to it and put more effort into it. The issue is that people can change from good to bad or bad to good at the same time, loving someone just involves a lot of risks that is hard to be controlled. At the end of everything, I only wish everyone the best of luck in finding a partner who is sincere to you. "

2163,58693,"My thoughts drift back to you. It's tracing itself to years ago, the first chocolate I received from you, the first conversation we had, the first message you sent me, the first time I thought I felt something when you told me about your relationship problems. I repressed it. I don't deserve to be loved by anyone, much less you. 

I miss you very much. I miss the conversations we would have, the late night typing away on the phone for hours, just lying in bed and constantly trying to out-wit each other with the funniest replies or delving into the deep stuff of life. 

Things felt so comfortable with you. I could say anything and it wouldn't matter what it was, you always knew what I meant. I love it when we both type the same thing at the same time because it just clicks. 

We could stop talking for long, long months and every time we reconnect it feels exactly the same. We continue from where we left off and it seems as though the dynamic has never shifted. 

I didn't have the guts to leave my partner. You didn't ask anything more from me, always silently understood and backed away when you felt that you were coming to chartered territories you shouldn't intrude. But you already did, and I kept trying to say ""we are just friends, I'm just doing this cause we're friends"" but I was in denial. I didn't want us to be just friends. 

I didn't dare to ask for more because I know you wouldn't fall for me. I know, deep down you would never like someone like me no matter how well we hit it off. We are just friends. 

We just weren't meant to be a pair because in so many ways, we are universes apart and I don't see the gulf that separates but I know it exists. You love crowded places, new adventures, thrilling nights and cold beers and I can't handle noise or people, preferring to spend solitary evenings with a book. You're loyal, outgoing and so optimistic it's blinding. I'm bordering on suicidal nihilism.

Sometimes I see you around in school but I actively avoid you because I'm just too scared to talk to you again. I don't want you to feel like I'm using you. I feel ashamed. And guilty. I don't know how long I will feel this way. I wish you would just talk to me again, but you never start conversations with me since years ago and I think that is an indication of how you feel about me. 

I wish we could reconnect. I wish i could tell you how I felt about you just so you know - just so I could finally let you go from my heart and bury what would never happen between us. I wish i could spell out my true feelings - for myself. To at least be accountable to myself. 

Typing this is actually giving me a stomachache in the middle of the night. 

I wish you nothing but the best in life, because you deserve nothing less.

I went for an abortion too when I was still in university days. I did not regret my decision because I cannot give the best for my child. I did not tell my parents or family about it because they will definitely make me bear the child. Just before the abortion, I suffered from some side effect from the medicine the doctor gave and I was vomitting non stop and shivering in cold (when it's like 30 degree outside the clinic). After the abortion, you'll definitely feel guilty, you'll probably be unable to sleep well for a few weeks. But I didn't regret my decision at all. Don't think about what others say, think about what you really want. Do you really want the baby?

2197,58618,"Hey #58550

I've had an abortion few months ago too. It was a terrible ordeal for me. I'm really thankful my boyfriend was supportive and we're still very stable together. You should discuss with your boyfriend whether to keep the child or not. Personally for me, keeping it was never really an option. My boyfriend and I had lengthy conversations and had already decided to abort it before we even know of the pregnancy. I went for the procedure without my family and friends' knowledge because:

1. Their opinions won't change my mind. 
2. I didn't want them to worry about me dying or getting complications. Old people worry about many things. 

But in case you're worried and stressing out, here's a few tips. 

1. It's almost trauma free. I was 11/12 weeks into the pregnancy, I have irregular period so I didn't realise earlier. Plus I didn't suffer from those pregnancy symptoms so it was really hard to detect. Anyway I had a surgical abortion and throughout the procedure I was sedated. Slept for 1.5 hours thereabout. When I woke up I had no remembrance of what happened other than the fact that I was scared shitless and cried like mad few minutes before the sedation set in. I bled like normal period for 12 days after the procedure.

2. Finish the antibiotics your doctor prescribe you. Infections can be troublesome since your cervix is ""open"" and more sensitive after the procedure. And no sex for 2 weeks please control yourself.

3. There is very little risk unless you're in your late second / third trimester. It will not affect your future childbirth ability / lead to any problems with your future offspring. Of course, finding a legitimate doctor is important. Please don't visit the underground doctors for cheaper fees. It's not worth the risk. Research on your doctor before confirming the procedure. I got my doctor through a clinic recommendation. 

4. The procedure + review check up costed $3k-4k. I was asked to pay in cash, so do check with your clinic if you need to prepare enough cash for the procedure. 

Good luck and safe sex please. "

""I can tell that they are bored with me and uninterested in me. I know that people would rather talk to someone else than me.""

Yes, this applies to me too. Even when I make the initiative to strike up a conversation, they just respond passively to die down the talk.

I have never celebrated v day on v day itself, but I believe strongly in having special occasions in a relationship. No, I dont want expensive flowers, and no I dont ""only want guys to show their love on one day"". It goes without say that you should show love to your partner every day-- but that is a lowkey (albeit crucial) kind of everyday love, e.g. quality conversation, physical intimacy, shared hobbies.

Special occasions are, to me, for relationship highlights like handmade gifts and very nice dinners. I dont want those every day. Firstly, bc of cost and time issues, like seriously, can you make a gift every day? Secondly, i wouldnt want like champagne and oysters every day, because it would quickly become boring and our new ""normal"". I find that matters like good conversation should happen daily, but other things like expensive food taste extra good if enjoyed in moderation.

This is my party life and why do most think party girls are wild and definitely have fwbs and ons? Well, don’t be so narrow minded ????. 

Secondly, while Valentine’s Day is all about commercialism. Why don’t people take it as a chance to express love which one could possibly have taken other days for granted? It really depends whether your partner appreciate such opportunity. If nothing is said explicitly, then will gifting something on that very day (may not even be tangible or be of high value) hurt you? Are you afraid of being held in comparisons with other couple or are you afraid of showing your love to your partner? There’s a difference thinking practical and being thoughtful because imagine your other half have to look at her peers getting gifts and and answer why they have none? And of course, surely, if she loves you, she will justify for you."

2212,58587,"I always thought it’s pointless for the jc vs poly debate. I thought it’s wrong and “racist” to judge people by their school. But some recent experience has caused me to have a second thought. 

I always study at a certain library. Nowadays it’s suddenly packed with a lot poly kids because it’s poly exam seasons. I’m totally fine with it. 

I never had any problems with jc and uni kids. We are all busy studying and minding our own business. For example, when I sat beside an RJC couple a few days ago, they didn’t even twitch an eyebrow on me. They were so serious and earnest in studying that I felt inspired and enlightened by the atmosphere alone. 

However, some, some of the poly kids really behave like gangsters in the library. They are aggressive and self-centered. They think that they own the library, they deserve more rights just because they come in gangs, they outnumber others. Their ego get hurt easily even when you never intended to do anything with them. They like to interpret others’ actions negatively. They seem to focus on the wrong things, such as wanting to create a conflict with a stranger out of nothing. Do you come to library to do your exam revision or anything else? 

I used to have this naive thinking that poly kids are more fun and open than jc kids. Now I see the opposite. These poly gangs can be even more exclusive than your jc cliques. Basically anyone outside of their gang is their enemy. 

This is not a troll or stirring post. I’ve met nice poly people too. I’m only referring to some, some, some of them.

I am in the same situation as you. I am giving myself 6-12 months to find a relevant job of my major. I was from poly too so I am much older (That's seems to be a disadvantage too).

But I always remembered a friend from poly. He was 25 when he started poly (came after ITE & NS). I once asked him, ""Aren't you scared that by the time you graduate from poly, you might be too old for uni or even a career?"" I am from STEM and you know to advance in a science career you generally required a PHD in the long run. 

But then he answered, ""This is Singapore. No matter how old you are, as long as you want to work, you can survive. Wouldn't get rich, but definitely can survive."" Then he proceeded to calculate how much money he needs to survive a month (Just 30 days of hawker food and drinks, allowances for parents, internet and games); guess what? The amount to survive isn't much. Maybe it isn't a way to live, but coming from a poor family, it wasn't all that unfamiliar. Isn't it?

I have the same problem. It's easier for me to build positive relationships with cats than with humans. It's especially difficult in school.

2221,58565,"Disclaimer: this is not to trivialise the OP of #58462;

Saw several comments about how OP could be lucky in some sense. I'm not sure if they fully understood the situation. As a fellow suffer of similar conditions, I thought I should put this out. For people who are unfamiliar, perhaps you can consider watching the HIMYM episode where Robin discovered that she was infertile to get a glimpse of what it's like. 

I suffer from something similar. I was a party girl for some years of my life. ( My infertility had nothing to do with my partying or sexual behaviour. Signs of infertility was already showing way before I was sexually active) And I knew I never wanted kids. To some people, I probably struck the lottery of casual sex. 

But that's not what this is. 

This is about losing control over your own damn body. Not having kids used to be a choice that you could reverse up until a certain age. Not anymore. And it feels as if your body betrayed you. While you know that you have to love and be yourself because you have no other choice, sometimes you just can't help feeling dysfunctional. 

To add insult to injury, I became an ex party girl. Again, not by choice but because I no longer had the drive. 

I am not asking for sympathy or encouragement. I'm just saying that in life you gain some and you lose some. To OP of #58462, chin up. Perhaps the condition could even help you sieve out those who would love you for who you are, infertility and all your quirks. 

On the note of the party girl thing. I am really glad I had the wildest bedroom adventures in the years before I totally lost my drive.

So really, my 2cents is, as long as you stay safe, and handle relationships appropriately (e.g. don't cheat! Not classy!), there really shouldn't be a moral judgement to human sexuality. To quote a finance concept, this could be a time value of money thing. Also, old saying, a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush. So have fun kiddos, and stay safe!"

Hey there I'm not sure if you're the same person who posted a similar confession previously. I personally experienced incidents 1 & 2 also, but not 3

I was brought up in a family environment that made me have serious trust issues, resulting in me being pretty wary of everyone and building a wall around myself. Since my kindergarten days, everyday was spent feeling pretty emotionless and dead on the inside, where I was neither joyful nor angry, with my classmates all remarking that I was a ""cool and calm"" person. Watching movies with friends became a slight problem as they preferred the sad kinds, where they'd bawl their eyes out and look questiningly at me when I didn't join them

Things got pretty heated at home when I was in sec 4 and something snapped inside me, leading me to confide in a trusted adult. While I didn't think that things felt any different after that, it seems like the wall that has been built around me started cracking without me noticing and I started to feel a tiny bit of emotions (on hindsight)

It took a failed relationship in jc to open the emotional floodgates probably because I'm now able to relate to the sad songs and movies, but I will most definitely not recommend that you follow this route hahaha the pain and emotions are not worth the trouble. And even if the relationship works out, it may not be very healthy too as you've not gone into it with the right mindset. One op suggested googling ""alexythymia"" which you can try as well to see if you're able to relate to the descriptions there 

This took quite a bit of courage to write and I hope you won't feel that you're alone on this journey. All the best and good luck to you!"

I went for an abortion too when I was still in university days. I did not regret my decision because I cannot give the best for my child. I did not tell my parents or family about it because they will definitely make me bear the child. Just before the abortion, I suffered from some side effect from the medicine the doctor gave and I was vomitting non stop and shivering in cold (when it's like 30 degree outside the clinic). After the abortion, you'll definitely feel guilty, you'll probably be unable to sleep well for a few weeks. But I didn't regret my decision at all. Don't think about what others say, think about what you really want. Do you really want the baby?

2237,58537,"Seeing all the posts from ""nice guys/girls"" on here, I thought I should write my own and see what you people think. 

I'm not a nice guy. 

I don't have a chiseled bod; what I have may best be described as average or dad-bod. I'm not Kpop boyband-level of handsome with my looks, but I'm the guy next door with that spark in his eyes and a small smirk curling on one side of his lips.

I have a checkered personal history and engaged in a lifestyle of hedonism and casual sex with multiple partners, both male and female and those in between. I was fully aware of what I was getting myself into, I valued the sexual lessons and practice I got from all those experiences, and throughout all those years of singlehood hedonism and player life I've made sure to keep myself safe and an eye on my sexual and physical health. Thankfully, I'm fine. The upshot of it all is that I can safely say I am very talented in more ways than one to pleasure my future partner in bed. 

I have a temper and I don't trust easy. But if you get my heart then what parts of it I have left is all yours, and yours only. I've no intentions of dating for the sake of it and loyalty/commitment is a non-negotiable criteria I hold myself and whoever I love/am loved by to. I cannot abide cheaters and I cannot abide serial daters, and God help any of my partners if I find out they are cheating on me because I don't give second chances and I will always have a Plan B to get my own back. I'm not good with pacifying girls with cute gestures and wheedling, but I'd like to think I'm the solid shoulder they can rest on when they need comfort most, as well as a strong set of arms to pick them up when they're down and need someone by their side. 

I'm not a nice guy. Not one of those guys from a Korean romance drama, or Augustus Waters from The Fault In Our Stars. 

I'm Liam Neeson from Taken. I'm Severus Snape from Harry Potter. I'm Tony Stark from the Marvel universe. I have a great deal of history and scars in my past. I'm not perfect. But I'm real, I'm working on myself, and I know what I want in life from a future partner. I want someone loving, adventurous, non-judgemental, loyal, committed, not a shrinking violet, someone who wants me for the potential she sees in us combined and not who/where I am right now in life.

Males on the other hand during march 14 white day return the flavour to the females.

Hey there I'm not sure if you're the same person who posted a similar confession previously. I personally experienced incidents 1 & 2 also, but not 3

I was brought up in a family environment that made me have serious trust issues, resulting in me being pretty wary of everyone and building a wall around myself. Since my kindergarten days, everyday was spent feeling pretty emotionless and dead on the inside, where I was neither joyful nor angry, with my classmates all remarking that I was a ""cool and calm"" person. Watching movies with friends became a slight problem as they preferred the sad kinds, where they'd bawl their eyes out and look questiningly at me when I didn't join them

Things got pretty heated at home when I was in sec 4 and something snapped inside me, leading me to confide in a trusted adult. While I didn't think that things felt any different after that, it seems like the wall that has been built around me started cracking without me noticing and I started to feel a tiny bit of emotions (on hindsight)

It took a failed relationship in jc to open the emotional floodgates probably because I'm now able to relate to the sad songs and movies, but I will most definitely not recommend that you follow this route hahaha the pain and emotions are not worth the trouble. And even if the relationship works out, it may not be very healthy too as you've not gone into it with the right mindset. One op suggested googling ""alexythymia"" which you can try as well to see if you're able to relate to the descriptions there 

This took quite a bit of courage to write and I hope you won't feel that you're alone on this journey. All the best and good luck to you!"

2269,58487,"I don't know why people say that if you're rich or good looking or funny, you'll naturally attract a lot of girls to you. That's not always true. Over the years, I've been described by people around me as good looking, smart, hardworking (you have no idea how hard i've worked over the years), wealthy, nice and thoughtful. I've always been the outdoorsy kind and recently became more sporty and fit. Yet despite all the stereotype things that you'll assume girls would like in a guy, I've been rejected countless of times by many girls. I've tried meeting girls online and offline and yes, we do go out on dates and stuff, and the dates seem to go well (lots of laughter and stuff) but I never really get them to fall for me. Months and weeks of effort can to go to waste as they tell me, ""you're not what I'm looking for"" and then things come to a stop. Apart of me feels frustrated for being that nice guy and sometimes I feel that me being ""nice"" is the reason why I'm unattractive to girls. Sometimes, I'm always thinking, those girls are single for a reason. I like to think it's because they're overly picky or are overly entitled. They complain about not being able to find a boyfriend, despite the fact that sometimes there are some really good ones right in front of them but they are too arrogant to see it. In their minds only those popular few guys are good enough for them, but man do they fail to look in the mirror to examine their own attributes, they ain't got much going for them. And then other times, I like to think that I am the problem, I'm not wild or exciting enough to attract their attention. Maybe there's something I am not doing right...

2288,58462,"Disclaimer: this is not to trivialise the OP of #58462;

Saw several comments about how OP could be lucky in some sense. I'm not sure if they fully understood the situation. As a fellow suffer of similar conditions, I thought I should put this out. For people who are unfamiliar, perhaps you can consider watching the HIMYM episode where Robin discovered that she was infertile to get a glimpse of what it's like. 

I suffer from something similar. I was a party girl for some years of my life. ( My infertility had nothing to do with my partying or sexual behaviour. Signs of infertility was already showing way before I was sexually active) And I knew I never wanted kids. To some people, I probably struck the lottery of casual sex. 

But that's not what this is. 

This is about losing control over your own damn body. Not having kids used to be a choice that you could reverse up until a certain age. Not anymore. And it feels as if your body betrayed you. While you know that you have to love and be yourself because you have no other choice, sometimes you just can't help feeling dysfunctional. 

To add insult to injury, I became an ex party girl. Again, not by choice but because I no longer had the drive. 

I am not asking for sympathy or encouragement. I'm just saying that in life you gain some and you lose some. To OP of #58462, chin up. Perhaps the condition could even help you sieve out those who would love you for who you are, infertility and all your quirks. 

On the note of the party girl thing. I am really glad I had the wildest bedroom adventures in the years before I totally lost my drive.

So really, my 2cents is, as long as you stay safe, and handle relationships appropriately (e.g. don't cheat! Not classy!), there really shouldn't be a moral judgement to human sexuality. To quote a finance concept, this could be a time value of money thing. Also, old saying, a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush. So have fun kiddos, and stay safe!"

I cheated on my ex with my current boyfriend. It was supposed to be a short term thing while I was still attached to my ex, since our sex life had dried up and to be honest, it was pretty unsatisfactory. To make matters worse, through the year or so we were together, we weren't meeting much, and for the entire relationship, you could count on two hands the number of proper dates that didn't end in an argument, and on one hand the number of times we had sex, so we weren't in a good place in the relationship.

Then I met my current bf during lectures. He was kinda cute and seemed to be a decent person, so one day I guess it got the better of us and we made out in an empty LT that we were studying in.

A few days later, I went over to his place to study together. One thing led to another, and we ended up having sex. I went home after, but I went over the week later and we did the deed again. It's not so much that I wanted intimacy, but really there was a serious lack of it. I was stressed and decided why not, since my relationship was clearly going nowhere.

I broke up with my boyfriend maybe a few months later, and decided to get together with my current bf. It might make me sound like a terrible person, but I don't regret leaving my ex for him. We have a good sex life, and he makes an effort to meet up, we're emotionally compatible and click very well. We've been together for about a year, and we're still making an effort with each other, and I can honestly say we both see this going further.

I guess people would judge us harshly if they knew how we started out, but I honestly don't think people around us need to know. Why am I posting this? I just needed the space to vent - I don't think they need to know, but I'm constantly worried that they'll judge my relationship exclusively on the basis of how it started.

For one, she has been working for close to two years now and her income/money is still being stored in an ordinary savings account despite the many times i've told her to use a multiplier-like account instead for much greater returns. Secondly, for holidays we take together, I've always been the one planning and booking everything - from the air tickets to our accommodation to our itinerary (the bright side of this is she really doesn't complain about where we go and I get to decide almost everytime). Also, she recently bought an insurance plan from one of her relatives, but she has absolutely no idea how much she's paying and what the plan entails; her relative just approached her and she just agreed. She only knows that she would be paying ""a few hundred dollars"" a month. I'm really shaking my head thinking wth as i type this.

Everytime I bring up something serious that I would like her to do, she would casually brush it off with ""I dont know how to do it"" or ""i don't know la"" and get visibly annoyed if i push further. Things only happen if i do it with her, and most of the time i end up doing it for her, like bringing her to upgrade her mobile plan. Sometimes I really feel like I have a daughter instead of a girlfriend, and it's really tiring to be the one always doing all the work.

2311,58428,"Hello guys, I'm here asking for some diy gift ideas.

It's on Vday that I found that my gf actually like diy gift rather than me spending money on food/dress/decoration. 

For Vday, she gave me a little plushy she knitted by herself. So I thought it was really nice and cute. 

So right now I'm planning ahead and wanna ask what are the common diy gifts or what diy gifts have yall make for your bf/gf?"
2312,58426,"I really like this guy I did a group project with last semester and I think he likes me back. I was hoping he would ask me out on vday and I stalked him on instagram and watching all his stories and liking his pics. I saw him talking to this girl the day before vday and I saw him again in the morning on vday after lecture. I knew he saw me, I don't know why i did this, I pretended to like this guy friend I was with by acting flirty and giggling at him. He didn't even bother to say hi and walked away. I saw his instagram story of him cycling around nus on vday and I can't help but think he was with another girl. I still like him, what should i do??"
2313,58425,"Another side story from #58386

My gf told me not to get any roses for V day and she explained to me that it's expensive. Ofc i read all the facebook posts saying that this might be a trap. So in the end I still bought the roses, ready to surprise her.

On that day, I showed her the roses and wow, her face became black. She wasn't happy or excited about it. She just keep saying the money could have been better spent in something else. 

On hindsight, she really did say roses are expensive in a serious tone, but I just didn't care.

Lesson learnt: go and learn about your girl to see whether she expect or don't expect roses. (actually guys if yall still dk, just play safe, get some pretty flowers but not roses/sunflower - coz it's overly expensive)

Anyway, off to loving this little gf of mine. she seems wifey material."

sg don't celebrate white day. I'm not even sure if people lived in sg who knows about valentines know what is white day anot. I myself didn't know until manga enlightened me.

In japan feb 14 valentines is where girls give guys chocolate. There's two type. One is Giri choco (obligatory) for male acquaintances or friends so they won't feel left out. Another is Honmei choco (favourite) where you give to males you like.

Males on the other hand during march 14 white day return the flavour to the females.

In japan school, the girls of the class usually pile chocolates and other treats in the teacher desk for their male classmates to share during valentines and the guys would return the flavour during white day.

As a female myself, of course I understand wanting to be surprised by your bf, to not want to state things out so explicitly. But in all honesty, why are we even expecting males to keep doing things for us on vday? How about YOU do it first, to text him first, to give him chocolates (if not flowers) to wish him happy vday first? As far as I know, its Valentines Day, not My-BF-Owes-Me-Flowers/Letters/Dinner/Whatever Day. 

If you want something, learn how to ask for it. Tell your bf you want to celebrate vday. TALK. As many have already pointed out, no one is a mind reader. Discuss your expectations. How do you keep a relationship if you refuse to even let the other party know what you expect?? 

On that note, perhaps ask yourself why is it that you even WANT these flowers/whatever from your bf. To show off to others how sweet your bf is? To assure yourself he really loves you? Or because 'everyone else got them, why didn't I?'?

If its any of the above, then start thinking about why you are even in this relationship. Or what can YOU do to improve your relationship. Its YOUR happiness. "

2335,58389," Recently there was a post on NUSWhispers stating how someone dreaded CNY because there wasn’t much celebration and there was a lot of bitterness in the post. 

I understand the person feeling.

As a kid, I used to love CNY. There would be a lot of visitation on both parents sides and we would also visit my mum schoolmates house. 

I enjoyed CNY until a few years ago when my parents got divorced. CNY then became the dreaded reminder that my family is broken, in time of the festive season when everyone is having reunion dinner we would have to settle our own meals on our own and to make things worse most of the shops would be close by den. 

Ironically, during the season of CNY the streets would feel like a Ghost Town. 

 All the shop would be close and there won’t be a soul around except the foreign workers on the streets 

As compared to the other festive season where one could at least go shopping to forget their woes temporary, if celebrating wasn’t of a choice due to the loss of someone or broken relationships, and it is very real for everyone of us not just singaporean but to those staying away from home.

A Friend sent me an article on how we could help our neighbour or friends who are feeling left out during such a season. Like inviting them over.  

Some of the reply to the post were helpful and it gave me some perspective on how we could approach the situation.

Or maybe as adults we should be old enough to use the time to do sth meaningful during the festive period, for we are definitely not the only feeling lonely, or if it really bothers us tt much to take the initiative to hold a gathering.

To sleep around casually is to imply that sex is causal. Sex is causal is to assume implicitly that it can be divorced from other aspects of life, eg. emotional life, motivational life, values etc. 

You can divorce from it but you pay a big price for that. You have to fragment yourself to the casual pleasure of a transient sexual interaction in order to sleep around casually. 

Once you establish that as a habit with sex, which is a deep experience, what makes you think that you won’t transfer this to everything else you do? Ultimately, you won’t be a holistic and complete person, you will just be a fragmented person. 

Like what my mum always tell me: promiscuous people are the slaves of their own impulse. 

Think twice before you jump into the causal sex bandwagon. "

Despite what a shitty person he was, i tried to make my feelings known to him a few years back but he chose to ignored whatever i have conveyed to him.

2364,58344,"I was studying the other day near at a bench along a corridor. 

Two girls were walking in my direction and stopped at the dustbin near my seat. I watched the subsequent event unfold from the corner of my eye. 

One of the girls decided that she was going to throw her tissue paper from a distance (maybe about 5 metres away?) to see if she can prove her aiming accuracy. The other girl egged her on, with an expectant spirit - waiting to either congratulate or embarrass her friend. 

Unsurprisingly, she missed because the tissue paper was too light.

And what did she do after her unfortunate miss? 

She left. 

Yep. She walked right away, the two girls nonchalantly emitting raucous laughter at her pathetic aim, interrupting the silence of the corridor. 

The white, crumpled piece of tissue paper laid right at the bottom of the dustbin. This was when I looked up and my eyes trailed her back as she walked away with that presumptuous gait. The tissue girl even had the awareness to  glance back at me suspiciously.

When I was attempting to make sense of this outrageously brainless event and deciding if I should pick up the tissue for such shameless people (I should have) , the aged cleaner uncle came round to bend over his back (and bend his painful knees) to pick up that white evidence and put it where it belonged - to the dustbin. 

What tissue girl doesn't know is that this same uncle had  came earlier to empty the trash and cleaned up the corridor. 

As a man of integrity, this uncle had committed to his job and sweep up the place for us, leaving no traces of rubbish lying around because he KNOWS the importance of cleanliness and a comfortable studying environment for US.  

Imagine how he feels when he returned shortly after to see that his work has been violated by the most senseless and inconsiderate act of a student who will probably graduate to boast about her college degree.

That said everyone should be well aware that having multiple sex partners decreases your viability as a long term partner and this is more so for women than men (known as sexual market value in the red pill community)

Why?! Go read up on kin selection theory under evolutionary psychology. This is just a descriptive claim. Not a normative one. (ie this is just how things are, not how things ought to be)

2370,58335,"Those who keep insisting that they will only have sex after marriage may want to consider this story. I heard that a newly married relative separated from her husband, in preparation for a divorce, because she discovered after marriage that he has ED. They did not engage in premarital sex. She brought him to visit various specialists but they opine that his ED is unlikely to be curable.

Being relatively young (<30 years old) and hoping to have naturally conceived children, she asked for a divorce and the husband agreed. They will also lose their flat. All these could have possibly been discovered earlier if they had attempted premarital sex.

Food for your thought. "

2372,58333,"Referring to post #58333 on OP grilling his female friend regarding FWB, I can relate where OP is coming from. 

My dad is a smoker and when I tried to smoke in army, he literally wanna kill me and disown me. 

I challenged him by saying why he can smoke but I cannot. Initially he is very pissed off and say because I have to obey him because he is my dad. 

When things got calm, he finally opened up and told me smoking is bad, he made a mistake and he regret what he did. So he don’t want me to follow his bad footstep. I acknowledged it and I didn’t smoke till this day.

I suspect OP of #58333 is just trying to identify the party girl’s contradictions or try to make her acknowledge her mistake and wrongdoing. I think the OP is frustrated that she don’t want to be honest and wanna twist her words

If we’re being superficial, he’s not in great shape, he’s so much older, he’s not exactly good-looking. The first time he taught my class, I thought he was so uncouth and I even fell asleep during the first half of the seminar. He’s so clumsy too and my friends call him a try-hard because he keeps trying to be relatable that it’s kind of cringy. But somehow, after telling us his stories of going through some really hard times, I just started liking him.

I don’t know how old he is, but his hair is already partially white. He’s married and I think he has children. He’s probably a few decades older than me, probably in his fifties. I wasn’t even born when he hit his thirties, maybe.

I’d never in my life think of trying to “seduce” him or be a homewrecker, and there’s no way I’d ever do that, but I’m still sad that I have to like a guy like this. Even if he was single, let’s say he happens to like me back, our age gap is so huge and people would think I’m some money-sucking leech.

I keep looking at his social media profile and at his younger photos that I can find online. I even applied for a programme that I know he’s in charge of, hoping I can see him. I can’t stop myself from feeling sad that I can’t see him next week. I really wonder what he’ll think if he knows I have a crush on him."

2402,58284,"Hi, I am the one who posted #58259, the aspirating monk thing. Aspiring as in not a monk currently, but wish to be one in the future. It seems that a lot of people don't get that. I am still a lay person, have hair, normal clothes etc. So think of me as one of you, but just with a goal most of you do not have. Also, this is not a troll post. I realized that some of you think that it might be a troll post because you mistook me as a monk. That's a pretty bad image to put into your mind, I apologize. 

Also for those not familiar, being a monk does not make one automatically have no more lust. Mental cultivation is needed. So it's the path to reduce and eventually get rid of lust. But as long as I am a lay person, there is no reason why I should remain celibate, other than pre monk training.

More specifically, I'm looking to pursue a Master's degree in computer science. I'm currently attending school in Korea (Korea University) and am about to enter my last semester. I've looked on the website and other Internet sources but haven't been able to find answers for my questions regarding the admission requirements.

Currently, my GPA is around 3.1-3.2/4.0. I don't have any official research experience, but I did work for about a year at a cryptocurrency/blockchain-related startup. I took the GRE last summer and got a 163V/169Q/5.5AW.

Right now I'm not sure what to do, since it also seems that NUS requires you to have at least two years of work experience in the IT field unless you have a bachelor's degree in computing. I switched majors in the middle, so I have a double major degree in international relations and computer science.

The realistic option that I've been considering is to complete a Master's degree at my own school (since the bar is relatively low for students who completed their undergrad at the same school) and then consider NUS for a PhD.

2433,58235,"I'm a foreigner staying in Singapore. I rented a room and am currently staying with the landlords. Previously, I signed a contract with them, in which we have agreed that the minimum period of stay is 8 months. My stay has been barely 3 months.

A few days ago, the landlords told me that they have relatives / friends visiting and they need my room to host them. They asked me to find another place to stay and said they'll give me two months for the rental search.

I am in fact totally fine with moving out, just that I have a lot of luggage to move. I hate moving house; every time I do that I feel super exhausted. Apparently, the landlords don't care. I told them I want to stay for the minimum period as agreed in the contract, but they said no.

I don't want to argue with them (there's nothing serious to be argued for). It will make things even more embarrassing. But then I'm wondering: if the landlords can sign a piece of contract and simply treat whatever is written inside as nonexistent, then what's the contract for?

2437,58226,"Hey guys, year 3 Sociology student here.

In lieu of the new design-your-own-module initiative launched by NUS, I would like to get a rough gauge of the number of people who may be interested in taking a pass/fail module on anthropology and fieldwork.

I have pitched my idea to a couple of professors and they seem to be very willing to teach such a class.

Essentially, this module would cater to equipping students with the ability to conduct anthropological research in the field. I envision it to be the fourth methodology module (in addition to the three that sociology student already have - qualitative, quantitative, and visual ethnography). This module would take place within a specific field site (to be confirmed) and over the course of the semester, students would explore the field site from different perspectives. For example, the professor would examine the space from a historical perspective one week, and a social perspective in another.

What makes this module interesting would be how it allows the individual to engage with the SAME field site over the course of the semester and have first-hand experience and immediate feedback while conducting fieldwork. In some sense, this module would be very much like a field school but stretched over 13 weeks. This module would be theory-based but more technique base. Finally, I would also propose to invite several established field researchers/ research companies to help conduct some of the trainings or at least get them to come give us guest lectures. This would not only expose us to how commercial researchers work in the field, it would also allow us to make new connections with those already in the industry (which would be extremely valuable if you are interested to get internships/jobs in this field).

Anyway, this is just a rough idea and any constructive feedback would be much appreciated! Would help if you could perhaps comment if you're interested! Thank you for your time in reading this to it's entirety!"

If my mum die, I also won’t cry. Really. I have watched her fall asleep so many times, and I don’t cry all the way until she wakes up. Dying is the same as sleep what. If she sleep then I let her sleep, cry for what? Dying is you extend longer only, no?

A couple years after that, guess what, a new one. The new spots usually started as a abrasion/wound that somehow ended in an eczema spot. I could control it intermittently with moisturiser and coconut oil. These days I don't like to use those ultra-strong steroids anymore. What I found to work in combination without meds is: drinking vegetable juice (buy a juice and juice a lot of broccoli, kale, cucumber, ginger and lemon), moisturiser, and coconut oil.

And guess what, I inherited the condition. My grandmother on my father's side had it. It skipped my father apparently, then I got it. Do you know that people with eczema has an increased risk of stroke? Guess what other inherited  condition that I have is also known to increase the risk of stroke? Migraine. Got it from my mother.

Any opinions? 
2513,58116,"Recently I spoke to my cousins during cny visiting and we were discussing BTO and stuff... So one of them expressed with a tinge of dismay that he would probably never get married. Afterall he's evergreen. There was another cousin who is attached but wants to settle down asap. 

It's normal to feel the pressure to find a gf/bf or settle down especially when you see the people around you gradually hitting these ""milestones"". While it is great to see your friends finding happiness, you should bear in mind that life isn't a competition. It's not about who gets to find a gf or bf first, who gets to settle down first, who gets to have babies first, blah blah blah.

Everyone ""grows up"" at a different pace. My oldest cousin is 37 this year and she just got married. She used to party alot and change bf every few months. No one expected she would eventually settle down. 

In fact I used to party alot too. Encounted a few jerks along the way because I wasn't a ""good girl"" anyway. I've also faced countless rejections because I'm so thick skinned like that. But I don't think our past defines who we are. If there is any way our past could affect us, it only made us stronger than we were. We learn from the mistakes we made and we grow up from there. 

So eventually I got tired of all the aimless partying and toxic relationship drama and started to respect myself and treat myself better. I gave up my old habits and even found someone who thankfully doesn't mind my past. Like what he said, whatever happened in the past belongs in the past, most importantly is who you are right now. 

This is one of my favourite quotes: ""If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.” - Lao Tzu

So, don't let your past define who you are today and don't be in a rush to hit those so called milestones in life. You don't have to be like everyone else. Just be at your own pace ;)

2533,58088,"In response to #58014 , if this was really written by a girl then thanks for your honesty (cause the overall tone and style sounds more like it was written by a dude masquerading as a girl), and I would say what's done is done, you're still in your 30s so try and make the most of what's left of your youth, and don't dwell too long on what's past. 

However in response to your post, the fact of the matter is that hindsight is 20/20. From a guy's point of view, I feel that hookup culture and the situation you described is applicable to both sexes. The fact of the matter is that it is becoming harder to enter committed relationships at this age compared to our parents' generation - that's why divorce rates are on the rise. It's not quite as simple as seek and you shall find in relationships these days. So for those struggling to find someone, what I would say is just focus on being the best version of yourself and bringing something to the table in a relationship, and naturally you will have a higher chance of attracting a best match. Relationships at these age are nice, but they are ultimately not some secret formula to happiness and in fact can be a huge ass emotional burden if things go south. Don't place your whole identity in finding him/her, but in finding you. Good luck."
2534,58087,"#58036: common mistake guys like you make is to ask for daring advice from girls. 

Dating advice from girls to guys can be useless or even harmful because they often tell you the politically correct thing instead of hard truths. Also while they can tell you what they THINK a girl wants, they often leave out the important details because they are either unaware or unwilling to state them out. If you are unlucky they might even give you self-serving advice that lowers your odds but benefits them.

For example I am sure your female friends told you that you need to do all kinds of nice things to win that person you like over, what they often neglect to mention is that for all those nice guy wooing things to work you need to be attractive in the first place. You are right that sometimes they just enjoy seeing the drama happen to have something to gossip about. 

If you are a chef do you ask your customer how to cook a meal? No right? The best your customer can do is to roughly describe what they like, and often they will not even know what exactly it is. It is the same with asking for dating advice from girls about girls. There might be some exceptions that really do give good advice but those are few and far between, especially if you are talking about the uni age bracket. 

For the best dating advice, try asking successful men instead. They did what worked and understand the struggles that face a man in the dating marketplace. They are also willing to lay the hard truths on you and be clear about your odds and what you need to do. At the end of the day, a man's journey requires guides that have walked the path themselves.

- longer foreplay, being relaxed, and lose yourself in the situation. Don't think too much.

The most reliable (and discreet) ones I've found are OPSM handheld massagers or similar. Flimsy, cheap toys don't last for long (the motor wears out or something).
- According to Dave Lampert, the inventor of the Sybian (wikipedia it), woman-superior (Girl-On-Top) position works best; and the Sybian is designed for that philosophy. Apparently, that machine is great (according to people who used it), but it costs like >1500 dollars. However, during my experimentation with then boyfriend and now husband, the best and quickest method or orgasm for me is oral and me sitting on his face. Sitting seems to make blood rush to that region more than when I am lying down making it easier.

Count yourself lucky that your girlfriend, despite being vastly more mature than you are right now, in terms of education and work experience, still want to stay with you and have sex with you. So: do your best. She needs that sex to de-stress. Hell, during stressful time at work, I may masturbate in the toilet to clear my head before heading back in. And I am married.

It's more or less your duty to not only have sex with her, but to do it well. Give her the best time she could have. Can't give her orgasm with just penetration? Learn how to do it well. Ask her what she likes. Toys and oral are your friends. There's a joke that women are so needy and they want to cuddle after sex while men just want to sleep. If she does that, you aren't doing it well enough. All the women I've been with, if they get a good orgasm in, they just want to roll over and sleep.

Take my advice: once you start having sex in a relationship, don't stop (unless one of you is physically incapable). One of my relationship fell apart because while we were having sex regularly, we stopped because of an argument (she wanted bareback during her periods, I don't trust her past partners).

2561,58042,"Responding to  #58020, just to elaborate on some things you said:

- "" When you ask a feminist the definition for feminism, they will say that it means gender equality but all they fight for would be at the regions where men are *believed* to be at an advantage than women while they totally avoid and ignore the domains where men are clearly at a disadvantage than women."" I don't think this is the only issue. The main issue is that when you ask someone what feminism means, they tend to just say: ""equality"".

You don’t need to keep accepting all those invites to be jiemei or attend weddings if they make you sad, people will understand.   

One painful thing about being ex-party spinsters like us is this unspoken expectation to keep showing everyone that we are strong, complete and happy even if we are not. I think good men that might consider us can see through this facade and be turned off.   

More of us need to own our bad choices instead of being in denial- it’s the only way we can move forward and improve. It’s good that you are honest with yourself, I don’t think I could say what you did, but you did it for all of us."
2563,58038,"Even long before Fifty Shades of Grey came out, I've always fantasized about having a girlfriend as a submissive. But I feel that I face even more stigma and discrimination than homosexuals when I ""come out"". Friends perceive me as abusive, pervert, sex maniac, the list goes on. But that's not what BDSM is necessarily about. Its about a mutual trust and agreement between two people to engage in power play. And to be specific, I'm just interested in making love with a girl while she's restrained, minus all the spanking.  

If you tell people you are gay, there's still a higher chance that people will accept you. And at least LGBT has got a community for them to turn to where they can identify with others like them and eventually settle down with a soulmate. But till this day, I know not of any girls in NUS or Singapore who fancies or gets turned on being tied up while having sex. Perhaps, I'm the only one in Singapore who is unfortunate enough to be born with such a rare and unfavorably perceived sexual orientation, just like a rare disease. And people always say ""Accept yourself, be who you are"", but I find it hard to do so if I do not want to stay single :(

2565,58036,"#58036: common mistake guys like you make is to ask for daring advice from girls. 

Dating advice from girls to guys can be useless or even harmful because they often tell you the politically correct thing instead of hard truths. Also while they can tell you what they THINK a girl wants, they often leave out the important details because they are either unaware or unwilling to state them out. If you are unlucky they might even give you self-serving advice that lowers your odds but benefits them.

For example I am sure your female friends told you that you need to do all kinds of nice things to win that person you like over, what they often neglect to mention is that for all those nice guy wooing things to work you need to be attractive in the first place. You are right that sometimes they just enjoy seeing the drama happen to have something to gossip about. 

If you are a chef do you ask your customer how to cook a meal? No right? The best your customer can do is to roughly describe what they like, and often they will not even know what exactly it is. It is the same with asking for dating advice from girls about girls. There might be some exceptions that really do give good advice but those are few and far between, especially if you are talking about the uni age bracket. 

For the best dating advice, try asking successful men instead. They did what worked and understand the struggles that face a man in the dating marketplace. They are also willing to lay the hard truths on you and be clear about your odds and what you need to do. At the end of the day, a man's journey requires guides that have walked the path themselves.

I have 2 friends who used to be party girls too and when they look back on it, both were pretty embarrassed by their past.

However in response to your post, the fact of the matter is that hindsight is 20/20. From a guy's point of view, I feel that hookup culture and the situation you described is applicable to both sexes. The fact of the matter is that it is becoming harder to enter committed relationships at this age compared to our parents' generation - that's why divorce rates are on the rise. It's not quite as simple as seek and you shall find in relationships these days. So for those struggling to find someone, what I would say is just focus on being the best version of yourself and bringing something to the table in a relationship, and naturally you will have a higher chance of attracting a best match. Relationships at these age are nice, but they are ultimately not some secret formula to happiness and in fact can be a huge ass emotional burden if things go south.

From what I gather from your post, it seems to me that you've locked yourself out from any opportunity for sincere self-reflection and self-improvement. You explain away your lack of relationship success by saying that most men are insecure manchilds who couldn't handle you anyway, and that the women who do get attached only do so because they're traditional types that lowered their standards. But by adopting a view that these problems are ultimately the fault of the world and the people around you (but never of yourself), I think you might have failed to consider that others may have legitimate grievances with your personality and character - things that you should probably work on.

Sure, if they can't handle you at your worst, maybe they don't deserve you at your best. But try getting an abusive father to tell that to his children - this quote obviously isn't an excuse for bad behavior or problematic personality traits, and you certainly shouldn't use it as a way to transfer personal responsibility on improving yourself, into responsibility for others to accept you- nobody has that obligation and nobody is insecure for declining it.

People like you who give such stupid advice in a bid to make single people feel better are just straight up naive at best or totally blase in privilege at worst. 

The question begged here is, do ""successful"" men (by whatever definition you want to use) finally get life partners because they truly want and love them, or only because of their added material and social value they finally possess? In other words, who they are isn't as important as what's in their wallet, who's on their contact list, or how successful they are in their careers? 

We have a description for such women/men who would go for people with riches and social status when they otherwise wouldn't if such sweeteners didn't exist. They're called gold diggers. 

Also, what the hell is with all the singlehood advice preaching that one should not make someone their mission or goal in life, and instead focus only on themselves and their own desires? There is nothing less valid about someone whose motivation is their partner/potential partner as compared to someone whose motivation is career success, fame or money. All it means is such people have different priorities in life. To such people like myself, family and love and people matter far more than chasing the corporate climb or becoming one of the Who's Who in society. As someone commented, you can be a millionaire and yet still feel like a loser if you're still single, or worse still at that point constantly paranoid that people want you potentially for all the wrong reasons when they wouldn't give you a second glance or a chance before. 

Family matters. Love matters. Having a life partner matters. Stop demonising single people and thinking that them changing their motivations in life is somehow going to make them feel better because you're just taking a crap all over what drives them and what they desire as though it is of less significance than your materialism and thirst for power/fame/social status. 

Just because single people might be used to being single, doesn't mean they necessarily should like it in order to feel better about themselves. I know I'm in no condition or state to be in a relationship now, but it doesn't stop me from wishing that I was. "

2618,57953,"I've moved on in the past few years or so I thought.
From living an empty life - a life where I went about day by day just taking each crashing wave one at a time; Where aimlessness is the only constant; to one where I was able to do well at what I did.

It took me a good amount of time to walk through the wreckage of a failed relationship and, for the most part, you were there, even when I was obviously a burden on you.

There was always one thing that pushed me along and brought a smile to me, particularly when I have had a crazy day. It was always when the chat notification popped up, an Instagram post of your day, or when I catch a glimpse of your smile as you walk past. 

I had never confided in anyone more than I had you. Maybe that was a mistake on my part. I opened up so much to you that I formed too much of an emotional attachment to you. While it can be said that there is some transference of what I imagine the ideal relationship should be, there was no denying that we worked well together, we had similar interests, similar sense of humour, similar thought patterns. We are so similar that you have become the part of me that I love talking to about anything. Maybe it is my perception of you, but you were the one that pointed out our similarities. That’s one thing I know that this is not fully a matter of transference and will make it hard for me to ever get over you.

I felt almost the same pulls on my heart when you told me of your engagement as I did when I first started to feel my own life was going nowhere. I thought that I was going to lose you. You, my anchor in the storm.
I was still happy for you, though it cuts me ever so slightly each time you speak of him, or to see the ring on your finger. Not that I would ever put myself forth as an option. I was a wreck and still not capable of any support you need.

I tried to go about my life without you, and I did get better. Even still, just talking to you puts a silly grin on my face. I still do have little fantasies of us getting together but even there it never lasts, because I know that I cannot be what you need. 

The day would come when you told me of the solemnisation. I knew it was coming before you had even typed those words on your keyboard. I still couldn't be prepared for it, though something about the way you said it made me wonder if that was what you wanted. I didn't dare ask more then because I felt that I might be living a fools' wishful dream that this was not what you wanted and that you wanted out. Despite my other friends saying that I shouldn't ask you about it, I knew I could not bear it if this wasn't something that you wanted - something that would make you happy. I feel of two minds when I see you. I am happy to know that you are happy, but yet I die a little inside knowing that I can't be that one that brings you that happiness. 

I am caught in between a rock and a hard place. Do I bypass the feelings that I have confessed to you and maintain the friendship we have, while I try to heal from the self-inflicted wounds from what would never be; or do I put more distance between us by leaving everything behind and starting afresh elsewhere. 

How I wish I could have been the right person for you. I would still try to be the right person in whatever capacity you need me to be. I take you as my inspiration to move on and free myself from my own shackles. I know it would be a harder road ahead as I know I cannot be reliant on you. What might have been if I had just met you sooner.
I did mean what I said before in that I cannot see myself in any relationship in the future. You have unknowingly set a high bar for anyone that would come along.

I can only wish you happiness and joy, and that if you call me, I will be there for you no matter what. I would never turn you down. You will forever be my friend.

People like you who give such stupid advice in a bid to make single people feel better are just straight up naive at best or totally blase in privilege at worst. 

The question begged here is, do ""successful"" men (by whatever definition you want to use) finally get life partners because they truly want and love them, or only because of their added material and social value they finally possess? In other words, who they are isn't as important as what's in their wallet, who's on their contact list, or how successful they are in their careers? 

We have a description for such women/men who would go for people with riches and social status when they otherwise wouldn't if such sweeteners didn't exist. They're called gold diggers. 

Also, what the hell is with all the singlehood advice preaching that one should not make someone their mission or goal in life, and instead focus only on themselves and their own desires? There is nothing less valid about someone whose motivation is their partner/potential partner as compared to someone whose motivation is career success, fame or money. All it means is such people have different priorities in life. To such people like myself, family and love and people matter far more than chasing the corporate climb or becoming one of the Who's Who in society. As someone commented, you can be a millionaire and yet still feel like a loser if you're still single, or worse still at that point constantly paranoid that people want you potentially for all the wrong reasons when they wouldn't give you a second glance or a chance before. 

Family matters. Love matters. Having a life partner matters. Stop demonising single people and thinking that them changing their motivations in life is somehow going to make them feel better because you're just taking a crap all over what drives them and what they desire as though it is of less significance than your materialism and thirst for power/fame/social status. 

Just because single people might be used to being single, doesn't mean they necessarily should like it in order to feel better about themselves. I know I'm in no condition or state to be in a relationship now, but it doesn't stop me from wishing that I was. "

2653,57889,"To poster of #57842 advising on not telling gf about past prostitute history, it is a dishonest, coward and dishonorable mentality. Allow me to tell you why. 

We live by our own action. If you have the gut to do it, then you should deal with it and live with the consequence. Be responsible for your own action. If you feel it’s 自讨苦吃 or asking for trouble, then you shouldn’t have done it in the first place. If you try to hide, it means you are apprehensive. Then why didn’t you think of it before you do it? As the saying goes, 早知今日，何必当初?

Human make mistakes. Doing something wrong, remorseful or regrettable is ok. But not owning up and living up to the consequence is irresponsible, dishonest and cowardice.

Your mentality is dangerous. Fundamentally, you are basically saying you can do anything wrong as long as you can cover up and hide to avoid potential trouble. 

Hiding about prostitution might be a trivial issue. However, the true danger is that if you manage to get away on this issue, it will subconsciously plant a seed in your head and slowly distort your moral principle into “you can do anything wrong as long as you can cover up and hide to avoid potential negative consequence“. Slowly and gradually, you will go down a slippery slope and test the limit and apply the same mentality to other aspect of life, ultimately eroding away your morality. 

People don’t cover up their extramarital affair, thieving or even manslaughter from day one. It all started off when they were kids covering up trivial things like eating up their brother’s cookie. "

I think I am settling (he's a great guy tho) as I'm afraid I won't be able to find someone who is this good. Don't get me wrong. I still very much love him as a person and care a lot about him. I just don't romantically love him. I have spent many weeks thinking about whether I should end my relationship or throw away my concerns and commit to a lifetime with him. I know we'll be okay but I'm not sure whether its for the best. Any advice is appreciated.
2681,57847,"In relation to #57847
I'm actually quite curious about opinions on doxxing/mockery of people who do stupid things, and were unlucky enough to have footage end up on social media.
There are people who sympathise with the ""I am chinese"" lady (God I can't even remember her name as of now) when it comes to the doxxing/mockery portion, but I don't recall any such reactions during the Eric Cheung case? I'm not stating that Cheung shouldn't have been doxxed, but rather I'd like to throw out the qns of whether doxxing is an appropriate form of punishment, at all.

PERSONALLY, I find doxxing Choi ridiculously cruel. It wasn't exactly uncalled for, but I find it way too severe, given the nature of her case. However I don't seem to feel the same way about Cheung though. Perhaps it has to do with the differences in reactions to the cases?
I don't recall any hooha stirred up by Choi/her friends/family while there was still some weird shit going on between Cheung and the driver after their snafu. His underlying  snideness throughout the whole incident maybe?

I won't say that those 2 didn't deserve the nation mocking them; the fact that they continued to behave as such, knowing that their actions would be caught on film, suggests to me that they're 100% committed to whatever they intend to do, and equally committed to the possibility of footage ending up on social media, and the mockery and memes to follow. But doxxing? Is that warranted?

TL;DR @those who actually put in the effort to procure, or even share the personal details of people being mocked, the hell are you trying to achieve? Some may say I'm a hypocrite, but it isn't so much the action of doxxing I'm pissed at, rather our reactions towards the act of doxxing.
If our society has boiled down to the extent where people are supporting  behaviour like this, jeez.
Pretty obvious where I stand on the issue of doxxing. What about the rest of y'all?

2683,57845,"I have a girlfriend and she's from the PRC. Yes, I know what comes to your mind as you see the acronym 'PRC'. Many Singaporeans are judging people or the whole country based solely on the contents on social media. I don't understand how most guys who have never been to China and they have the cheek to say they hate the country or simply throw all your hateful rants about it.
90% of the content on Facebook/Twitter with regards to China are either hateful, fake or exaggerated, and these content are shared wildly. Whereas the 10% that says good things about the PRC (e.g. drones inventions from DJI, China's economic miracles), people tend to ignore or basically think the articles are just fake. 
The country has done no harm to any of you guys and yet, many of you bullies come together as keyboard warriors to flame them. If you really hate China so much, throw away 90% of the items you own, including those over-hyped iPhones. iPhones are assembled in China (Foxconn) and many of the components are made there too. The only thing that's so-called 'made in USA' is the IP, which is just a paper.

2684,57842,"To poster of #57842 advising on not telling gf about past prostitute history, it is a dishonest, coward and dishonorable mentality. Allow me to tell you why. 

We live by our own action. If you have the gut to do it, then you should deal with it and live with the consequence. Be responsible for your own action. If you feel it’s 自讨苦吃 or asking for trouble, then you shouldn’t have done it in the first place. If you try to hide, it means you are apprehensive. Then why didn’t you think of it before you do it? As the saying goes, 早知今日，何必当初?

Human make mistakes. Doing something wrong, remorseful or regrettable is ok. But not owning up and living up to the consequence is irresponsible, dishonest and cowardice.

Your mentality is dangerous. Fundamentally, you are basically saying you can do anything wrong as long as you can cover up and hide to avoid potential trouble. 

Hiding about prostitution might be a trivial issue. However, the true danger is that if you manage to get away on this issue, it will subconsciously plant a seed in your head and slowly distort your moral principle into “you can do anything wrong as long as you can cover up and hide to avoid potential negative consequence“. Slowly and gradually, you will go down a slippery slope and test the limit and apply the same mentality to other aspect of life, ultimately eroding away your morality. 

People don’t cover up their extramarital affair, thieving or even manslaughter from day one. It all started off when they were kids covering up trivial things like eating up their brother’s cookie. "

I have been attached to my lady for 4-5 years now, and she used to be seen as ""the one"". We were very happy together and we didn't quarrel throughout the years - till a few months back. It started with her being out with a small group of people, and trust me, I have never once limited or stopped her from going out. She is working, but because of this group, she started hanging out till, on average, 3am in the morning. The most ridiculous of all would be till 5am, despite having work the next day. This would happen in a week and the week following, until i voice my displeasure. She has also been very close to a guy which I think would make a good friend, until recently he decided to confess to her, despite being engage himself. Afterwards, we had some tiff and the conversation did subside a little, but a surfeit of chats followed there after. Despite she telling me that she had told the other party that they should limit their conversation, the chats didn't tone down a little. Verily, the chats nowadays might have revolve around work (I don't know) because I didn't want to read, hence I might be slightly overreacting a little. Now here is my question. Given all this, I didn't tell her to stop talking to him in the first place because I know there will need to work together. But I only wished that she would try to keep the conversation to the minimal because in my opinion, the guy stepped over the ""boundary of a friendship"" and how would things just be back to ""being normal"" once again. Is it on my part, that I am overreacting or being too sensitive? Because I do admit I am of a sensitive sort. What should I do because her being ""not the one"" has been crossing my mind. I hope you guys will put yourself in my shoes because it is always easy to say that ""since you have doubts, it meant that the trust is gone and bla bla bla"", but imagine for once, she was and might still be the one because there wasn't any issue prior.

I hated being alone, but there was nothing else I could do. Being friendly to them make them take advantage of me. So I end up just kept quiet because I don’t want myself to be the gossip of the day. I hated people gossiping about me and no matter where I go, I am always the topic of the day. For every small little action that I do, it end up become a big gossip. And I’m so afraid that I don’t dare to tell my mom about it. And end up I kept it with myself. Though she knows about the cyberbullying shit but she does not know what’s happening at the back. And sometimes I really wonder one thing. Is she really my mom? Like she keeps comparing me to my sister and even the way I look will cause her to give comments like how come you so fat? Even my auntie and uncles will pamper my younger sister and buy her dresses and clothes and other stuff that fits my sister well. And my auntie will always give comments like you really should lose some weight or next time don’t have bf then you know. I just dislike it. I hated myself because of that.

So naturally, I offered him half of my bed to sleep on, because naturally that is the polite thing to do. There's nothing awkward about two bros sleeping on the same bed, right? Well, I found out later when we were asleep that my homie has this habit of reaching over and spooning whoever's in bed with him. I woke up in the middle of the night to find him clasping me and trying to hump me or something. I thought it wouldn't be polite to wake him up, so I just gave in and started hugging and humping him also. We both woke up in the early hours of dawn with the sunlight bathing our sweating half-naked bodies as were lying on the bed in a tight embrace. When we both realized what was going on, he laughed it off, saying ""no homo."" When he asked me to say ''no homo'' in return, however, I felt sad and reluctant. Am I gay? "
2734,57737,"This is probably my first and my last post on NUSWhispers. I'm already a graduating student so this is not gonna affect me any longer but I hope something can be done regarding this and someone is able to tag the relevant body.

I saw a fellow student running towards the bus as the bus uncle was closing the door. The bus barely stopped for a few seconds before speeding off when she was already less than a metre away.

This is unfortunately a common sight and I wouldn't bat a lid on any other day day. However what really triggered me today was the uncle's attitude. Upon shutting the doors on her, he said sarcastically in mandarin ""you can slowly wait looo"" and proceeded to brag to a friend beside him how he'll even speed past students if they remain seated during the night shift. To top it off, he proudly claimed that there are times when he's able to end his round trip before his friends on other routes. Is this even a game or a race?!

I can't speak for all students in NUS so I want to make it clear that this post is how I personally feel about our shuttle service.

The shuttle service has been getting worse lately, with drivers driving recklessly (campus security anyone?), speeding through humps and turns, people losing their balance, etc. These are things that I see students go through on a daily basis.

I able to recall the bus plate, bus service, location the time during the incident to lodge a complain but I don't wish to see any heads roll cause of this as I feel that it can be resolved with some internal restructuring.

Please comment if you feel the need to, be it constructive or if you find that I overreacted."

I'm trying to understand your pov. If the author is a woman, stop over-generalizing the female population. Some are perfectly capable of doing your idea of 'compartmentalizing' - which according to you, refer to 'separate their feelings from sexual needs'. Women do have sexual needs too, sex is not just for procreation or as a gift to a man in return for the love between them. It just so happens that women do tend to be able to be more selective about their sexual partners, which may explain your illusion that males 'need to get into a woman’s head before you get into her bed'. 

If you are a male, I can see why you are doing this relative comparison. But please do not degrade the entire male population and reducing them to shells who simply act on their animal instincts. Love encompasses everything, including and most importantly respect for the other party. Personally, I do have a problem with your idea of love that a man has for a woman, because it seems as if the 'love' is limited to sexual attraction and seeing the other party as an ideal mate to value-add to his family life. 

Do unto others what you would have them do unto you. This applies to cheating as well. If you take the view that cheating is fatal to a relationship, do away with the male vs female distinction and do not compare like with like with the effect of forcing a difference on something that is in substance, the same. 

These are just my personal views and you are most welcomed to disagree.

2762,57705,"To #57687:

1) Don't be discouraged. I am a CS graduate and I suck at maths too. I used to take weeks to study for maths intensive papers (e.g. CS1231, CS3230) compared to a day for non-maths intensive CS papers (e.g. CS2106, CS4212). I played with Linux all my life, so I understood OS, compilers, it is so logical, but I didn't understand how CS1231 could make things so complicated. Hahaha XD

I think you and I are the same kind of people. We love practical hands-on stuff. To build kickass shit. Well, you can build kickass shit without lots of complex maths. We hire maths people for those parts. We understand computers, but we don't understand maths.

3) While what Prof Ben Leong said in the comments, CS is Applied Maths is kinda true. That's also kinda an overgeneralized statement. CS is not all about maths. It is about 0s and 1s and how those 0s and 1s can be used to improve lives.

Be humble, keep working hard. Even if you suck at maths, just try your best to pass the modules for now. Don't know, just ask your friendly neighbourhood professors, they are really nice.

4) Never forget what is your purpose for studying CS? To get a better paying job? Because you enjoy coding? Or because you like maths?

If it is to get a better paying job, the concepts of scalability, reliability, access controls, software lifecycle, software architecture and design, technical debt, technology risk management, version control, is far more important than any complex maths you use CS. I recommend you to take software engineering, information security, practise your coding skills and learn to communicate core CS concepts in layman terms. These things add far more value to your future employer than any maths skills that you may have.

I have seen many people who have great maths skills, but in the end, they can't speak, they can't communicate, heck, they can't even speak in proper sentences. Don't be an alien like them. Be a team player, be the bridge between business executives and the tech team. Be project manager, CTO, team lead, those roles get paid more too.

5) And if your purpose is because you enjoy coding, just code on the side, in addition to mugging out those maths stuff. Try out new software like Docker, Vagrant, try compiling Gentoo, haha good luck with that man, try reverse engineering software, try to automate your life, try Beets to sort your music collection, try to write your own TrueCrypt software, maybe make some Android games. Those things are hella fun to do and keeps you sane. And these things are skills that might be useful in the future.

6) If your purpose is because you like maths, then well, take a PhD, or do research, I guess.

Haha, have fun coding! =)"
2763,57704,"During my school i love cooking and baking. My passion was in kitchen. But, my mum she want me to take a glamour or most popular courses for career. Tbh, i politely decline and tell my mum i love being in the kitchen. But she plead me politely. Im the only child in the house after. I love my mum she's my everything. So i take the courses as her suggestion. But stand in the kitchen is still my passion. After years studying this courses suddenly i feel regrets for listening to my mum request on follow her path.

2764,57703,"As a graduating student I feel as though I did not fully experience my uni life in terms of what I paid for. 

I'm not talking about friends or studies, I've have many friends, many many friends. And I've learned a lot, even sat in a couple of classes. But of course, take my advice, there's a lot more that we paid for. Don't wait until your graduating semester to fully experience the uni life. 

Stay in hall at least once, even if you're just crashing. It's quite an experience to wake up 10 minutes before class and not be late.

Play the board games at YIH (or from the Board Games Club), some are pretty amazing. 

There used to be FIFA but I recently tried and was denied so I dont know whats up with that.

Try the various food places at different faculties (not as a routine because no student has time to travel and eat). Ask around and you'll be amazed at what each faculty has to offer. 

Explore the libraries - they have amazingly good books. 

Do sports at the many facilities, going to the gym counts. Dont be afraid to swim, it's very liberating and while the Utown pool concept is cheesy, I feel like that pool is now a lot more relaxing because the ""serious"" swimmers have all moved to the new MPSH. 

Get sick or just get some free meds. I was surprised some people never knew it was free. Dont we all want to do drugs at least once? 

Get depressed and get some free counselling. They're comfortable to talk to and will help you back on your feet.

Hang out at the new PSS. They have a Nintendo switch with a few great multiplayer games (I have personally requested for Mario Party to be added, but if they find it difficult to... Honestly i wouldn't mind chipping in to pay for the game - its fun). Plus they have their own board games, art therapy corners, and is just a peaceful place to be...on second thought dont go there. I dont want too many people there when I'm trying to relax. 

Hang out at the various lounges in different faculties and departments. They are usually open. 

Run around or cycle around the entire NUS. Nowhere else can you get such great uphills and downhills. 

Drive and park in the carparks ar least once. The museum carparks is extremely cheap if you have classes from morning till afternoon as they have a maximum cap if until 7.30pm. 

Attend all the various events. There are too many to attend, and honestly every event is not catered at the entire school. In fact, the turnout is (honestly) quite small most of the time. But guess what, all events still prepare as if the whole school would come visit. So feel free to attend any event (free or otherwise). Might be hard to get to the more popular events though... But the niche events are actually what surprised me more because of how interesting and different they are. 

Go to the museum, and by the way we have 2 museums (some people dont know...). Its not particularly large but its free for NUS students. And you get to see some cool dinosaur bones + dead animals and their insides (for the natural history museum). The other museum is more cultural and provides food for thought most of the time so feel free to enjoy both while you can. 

Find hidden spots to take your date to. There are a lot in the world and NUS is no different. A tip: restricted areas arent locked all the time... And some are surprisingly never locked. If you see me there however, please give me some time - I'll leave when I'm done. Since I'm graduating I'll give you a hint, some areas are extremely nice places to enjoy some stargazing (yea Singapore doesn't really have stars but who cares). 

Crash classes with or without the teachers' consent. For those in FASS, check out when the modules are screening movies. The movies are often old or Singapore based but some are classics and are still enjoyable (e.g. Psycho). 

These are but the many things I have thought of doing but have hardly done and while its possible to do some of them after I graduate... Its just not the same ya feel me? 

And if anyone else has more exciting things to do as an NUS student please comment. Preferably free since I'm broke. "

2778,57684,"People always say that you should not remain friends with your ex partners for various reasons, but to me they are all circular arguments. I don’t understand what’s the “real” reason? 

People say, you need to “move on” and show respect to your current partner........:.but why don’t people say “you shouldn’t contact your jc friends now that you’re alresdy with nus friends. Contacting jc friends prevents you from “moving on” and transitioning into nus univeristy life!!! “ has anyone said that?

 No. 

Why should we “move on” from previous relationships when a new one has formed? I will never forget my old friends in jc when I settle down in nus, and I don’t see how that’s being “unfair” to friends in nus? 

People also say “staying friends prolongs the pain of separation”. Separation happens in many ways, including graduation where I had to part with my closest friends from jc. 
How does cutting ties with my former friends from my previous school “prolong the pain of separation “? 

When school ends after graduation,I never cut off contact with my friends. I don’t believe staying friends with my jc mates prevents me from making more friends in nus and neither will this disrespect my new friends. 

So why can’t you stay friends once the relationship is over?

Folks, be it you are from JC or Poly you will still graduate eventually, now that you are in uni. It is the value of your cert and how capable you are to get your dream jobs that matters. 

In fact, it is more about standing out among your peers or your colleagues that get you the recognition. It is not like as though coming from a JC or from a poly will ensure you will be able to get a good job, get married or even get your CPF earlier than the rest... 

And trust me, when you are so done with your work, you wouldn't even have the time to get triggered over the JC and Poly comparison. At the end of the day, buggers that make such comparisons are just there to boost their ego and will probably forget what they said few seconds later, while you are still fuming. "

I have heard that Comp Sci students are one of the most sleep-deprived segments student population in NUS. My CS friend who's only a Year 1 skips lunch everyday because he's so stressed and bogged down by the workload and competition that he's constantly doing his work. 
And isn't this also why the school could pull off last year's April's Fool hoax about adding 0.1 CAP for the students if they sleep more than 8 hours a day?

2800,57651,"Just wondering that for Lost and Found items that could point to the identity of the owner (usually matric cards la), wouldn't it be better/easier/more effective to just email the fellow student (or even staff) who has lost his/her belonging(s) since we could find (almost?) everyone's email on the email directory? I know there has been the initiative of an NUS lost and found telegram group but it might not be accessible to everyone (for instance, those who don't use Telegram, or those who do but are unaware of the existence of this potentially life-saving resource - they could be the finders and/or the ones who misplaced their items).

**But I have a concern regarding directly emailing the owner of the misplaced item though. In doing so, would we be violating the PDPA (which OSA is so uptight about these few years)?

On a side note, I think the NUS lost-and-found telegram group, as of now, might not seem to be very effective, since it is kind of new (it has  only established since the start of Sem 1 of this AY18/19 if I'm not wrong) as compared to NTU and SMU's support groups which started out earlier and has greater access to the student community (not sure if it's because their students have a greater tendency to misplace their stuff or the campus is quite big or both).

But in any case, really kudos to the admins (of not only NUS' group but also those of the other local universities' support groups) who started this community initiative to help out your fellow schoolmates (or even staff) who misplace their stuff around campus (or on the MRT near our campuses)!

2803,57645,"Yesterday was my birthday. My friends booked the SRC when they decided to gather to have a friendly badminton game. I was so excited thinking that they would be celebrating for me! As I was imagining...perhaps the sports hall is going to be filled with so many balloons, it would be decorated as if there is a party going on. There was multiple bouquets of flowers and other colourful assorted things.

The huge suprising factor was that my buddies had purchased a pair of colorvision correcting specs for me, as I am apparently colorblind. All of them took out their flashy handphones and started taking photos and videos and posted on the social media. They told me to put the glasses on and at that moment I was damn excited, my heart was beating so fast as I was about to see the colours in life that I had been missing for 20 years. 

My boyfriend appeared out of nowhere to put on the specs for me but...absolutely nothing. Everything was still black and white. But at this point I can't disappoint them, as the specs are so expensive and that they have taken so much effort to get them for me and decorated the hall with colourful balloons and gave me so many bouquets of flowers. I have cannot put them down.

I told myself to summon all my acting and lying skills. I became dramatic and started thinking of all the sad moments in tragic movies I love, Inside Out and More than Blue. My boyfriend is dying from the last stage of cancer, I have no idea how many stages are there in total, but I need advice. I started for the second time to cry so badly my hands were trembling. I forced myself to start crying for the third time I have mentioned this and I was so surprised to be able to see colours.

Actually the glasses didn't work and at this point of time, if you are still reading this you would have realised that I am seeking for your advice for something that I myself am unsure what is it about. I carried on writing about it but I don't even dare to tell anyone because I am afraid that people will realise that this doesn't mean anything at all. 

Thanks for reading and sorry for the long confession. So, should I still be with my boyfriend? I love him so much but I love girls too!"
2804,57644,"I feel so, so dumb. And I'm a final year student.
I wasn't even a ""high achiever"": I was always that kid who, if put in a better class, I tank the bottom positions, and if put in an average class, I do just fine. So maybe I had some expectations, but not enough for me to feel like I'm suddenly dumb (basically, I always felt like I am, but not to this extent).

But I somehow am here today, feeling so stupid and so dumb all the time, because everybody else seems to know what they're doing, what they're talking about, what the deeper issues of things are. 

I feel like I lack every single thing that a final year uni student should have, and it's depressing me a little because it's not like I haven't tried - tried to do my homework, tried to read up on things, tried to research for myself things that I don't understand, tried to ask questions (except, because I don't know what I don't know, I often just stare blankly at everyone else in class). 

I feel so stupid and it's depressing. If I double down on my efforts, will I get better? Will I somehow be brighter, more critical, much smarter? Will I somehow ask the RIGHT questions, say the RIGHT keywords, make the RIGHT point that is good and intelligent?

I know I'm just a small fish in a very, very big lake, among the best and the brightest. And I appreciate that I have some place, even if it's absolutely minuscule, among them. But it just sucks to feel - and be - incompetent. And it just sucks that this might just be the road my future goes down."

2810,57635,"#57602: There is usually an ""official"" version of a story, to be taken at face value; your thesis is basically that version, and so is the entire field of international relation, which are mostly the official and ceremonial part of strategy.

First, mentioning the absence of evidence of Huawei ""spying"" is both technically correct and naive. Everybody who knows a tiny bit about espionage knows that every embassy and consulate are filled with spies. Probably a quarter to half the staff. This is a perfect cover: legitimate job and diplomatic immunity. Everybody knows this and nobody is ""that"" serious about rooting out the spies. It's a quid-pro-quo: if you try to kick out all the spies of a particular country, that country can also kick out yours and your embassy and you become practically blind, deaf, and dumb. This explains the practice of expelling foreign diplomats during tense moments.

Second, technological firms are spying and collecting data? What else is new? Water is wet? Of course they do this. The big problem with spying is not whether someone is doing it or not, but rather whether they do it can get caught.

Third, while you are accurate that this, like expelling diplomats, or Frau Angela Merkel complaining about the NSA wiretapping German citizens, a political move; it is an extension of geostrategic competition. Once upon a time, we competed by killing each other on the battlefield. Ever since the end of WWII, geostrategic competition has been surprisingly and relatively bloodless. Sure, there are the occasional war; but consider that fewer Americans died in the longest war in American history than half a day on the beaches of Normandy, that is some impressive progress. Half of American war deaths were from one 19th century war (the Civil War).

This round of geoeconomic conflict is just a tiny bit inconvenient. No one is dying. Don't get your panties in a twist "

The problem with polytechnic graduates is that their GPAs are graded very differently depending on polytechnics, depending on lecturers' bias, groupwork luck, internships, alot more things than just pure grades. Did I mention groupwork? Seriously, groupwork.

Let's start with the biggest factor. Groupwork. By far the most unfair and senseless grading component that academia has come up with, it can easily toss up the GPA of the undeserving students like freeloaders who end up in a group of smark alecks and pull down the GPA of smark alecks who end up in a group of freeloaders.  I'm sorry, but groupwork is utter BS. Ask ANY poly student, ANY. I guarantee you most of them will tell you the same thing. Groupwork is utter BS.
It's extremely unfair and can completely turn upside down your GPA depending on who you get. During my time in poly, I've seen students just free-riding up up A grades in group project even when they hardly did anything.  I myself had to carry useless group members plenty of times just so they don't drag my GPA down. At least it's not as infuriating in uni since everyone here is more grades-obsessed. 

Another thing. Internship. The poly I come from takes internship grades as part of your GPA so if you end up with a s***ty company with a super strict supervisor, you can kiss goodbye to your GPA or try to kiss your supervisor's butt as much as possible. Meanwhile if you end up in some company with a lax supervisor or know how to rub shoulders, you can be sure to get instant A+. An A+ for one whole semester is a HUGE raise in GPA. Tell me how's that fair at all. 


And lastly, lecturers. If you LUCKY to get some lecturer who's really lenient and give everyone A grades for group projects, then your GPA will shoot up. Vice versa.


Notice how it's all friggin' luck?


The world isn't fair and polytechnic is by far the biggest example of reflecting just that. It's not like JCs where everyone has to sit for the same A levels, marked under the same criteria, competing under the same bellcurve. 
In poly, there's so many unfair factors all over the place. Kinda like university, right? 


My class had alot of poly students by batch arrangement and there's some of these students still acting so blur or slack it makes you wonder how they even ended up in NUS.  HOW?

Now you know how. "

2837,57602,"#57602: There is usually an ""official"" version of a story, to be taken at face value; your thesis is basically that version, and so is the entire field of international relation, which are mostly the official and ceremonial part of strategy.

First, mentioning the absence of evidence of Huawei ""spying"" is both technically correct and naive. Everybody who knows a tiny bit about espionage knows that every embassy and consulate are filled with spies. Probably a quarter to half the staff. This is a perfect cover: legitimate job and diplomatic immunity. Everybody knows this and nobody is ""that"" serious about rooting out the spies. It's a quid-pro-quo: if you try to kick out all the spies of a particular country, that country can also kick out yours and your embassy and you become practically blind, deaf, and dumb. This explains the practice of expelling foreign diplomats during tense moments.

Second, technological firms are spying and collecting data? What else is new? Water is wet? Of course they do this. The big problem with spying is not whether someone is doing it or not, but rather whether they do it can get caught.

Third, while you are accurate that this, like expelling diplomats, or Frau Angela Merkel complaining about the NSA wiretapping German citizens, a political move; it is an extension of geostrategic competition. Once upon a time, we competed by killing each other on the battlefield. Ever since the end of WWII, geostrategic competition has been surprisingly and relatively bloodless. Sure, there are the occasional war; but consider that fewer Americans died in the longest war in American history than half a day on the beaches of Normandy, that is some impressive progress. Half of American war deaths were from one 19th century war (the Civil War).

This round of geoeconomic conflict is just a tiny bit inconvenient. No one is dying. Don't get your panties in a twist "

The reason is simple. The sex did not turn out as good as he expected. Could be because he’s a virgin with unrealistic expectations or you weren’t good in bed, etc. For #57574, both reasons could have applied to your context as you both were virgins.

There could be other reasons as well. I once met up with a foreigner through a dating app and we hooked up. The way she made out with me was kinda gross, and being a virgin she was inexperienced, so the encounter was really bad for me. She wanted to meet up again before she fly back but I ghosted her.

My take is that it should simply be viewed as a basic instinct shared with other animals. I simply do not think sex should be glorified as something sacred to only occur after marriage. Just like we don't necessarily glorify all our meals.

I have taken modules in Political Science, Philosophy, Southeast Asian studies and am now taking modules in History and English linguistics.

The most important motivation for me even applying to FASS in the first place is its offer of a wide variety of academic disciplines, flexibility, and expertise (given that it’s the most established - among the universities in Singapore at least).

But anyway I'm not really sure if there actually had been undergraduates who got into the RCs in their Y2 of studies (although the website did mention the 1-year RC programme). In any case it would likely have been a small group of fortunate ones.

It's an extremely sad occasion. I cannot imagine how devastated his family members are, his loyal friends and loving colleagues. Yes, it may seem unfair that he receives so much more attention and media coverage as a celebrity compared to similar (or worse) death incidents of average citizens/foreign workers. 

But a death is still profoundly grievous, regardless of who it happens to be.  

But I'm shocked and angry - how do the hundreds who went to see him off for the last time have the shameful audacity to stand right in front of the car carrying the coffin, snapping fervently away on their phones from all angles? 

This is the only time when his loved ones can try their hardest to obtain emotional closure. A proper farewell is absolutely essential to adapt and recover from grief. 

His funeral is not an exhibition. His funeral is not a quirky event to attend so you can say that you went. His funeral is a ceremony meant for actual grieving, commemorating and reckoning the mortality of all of us. This is the same for every other funeral.

Unfortunately, i also caught a segment of the video whereby a woman actually smiled sheepishly when being asked to make space for moving vehicles. Like a child's playful glee when he's caught misbehaving. There are those dressed in lurid colors - bright red, yellow, pink, orange - almost rudely oblivious to the sombre waves of black, grey and occasionally white all around them. 

Some even peered into the car. What are you looking for? Attention? 

The vapid urge to publicize anything and everything on social media as a testimony to your life is toxic.

2897,57520,"Guys are mostly insecure in a r/s because of those alpha and delusional guy friends around their girl. Why? Because those alpha and delusional guy friends have nothing to lose. Guys do overthink when their girlfriend goes out with another guy friend. (Ie. what if the guy friend ""kissed"" their girl , just like what you have seen in typical movies , or even the guy made the move on their girl? (ie. like trying to force a hug). Guys won't be insecure if you show them you are loyal. If a guy is just a friend, treat him like a friend. If a guy asks you (girl) out, kindly reject him.

Often I see my friends sharing with one another other about their relationship woes, only to set aside these sadness in them and reconcile their emotions and get on with their lives again. And often so, they will be hurt over and over again emotionally, because they tend to assess things with their feelings rather than logic. 

I have come to understand that as we devote ourselves into relationships, feelings supersedes logic at many instances. And if we decide to get into relationships based on feelings, rather than mutual understandings, then why are we logically telling ourselves that we should find someone who is truly good to us, only to revert to being someone who settles based on our feelings? 

I just feel that one should commit into a relationship based on an admiration for someone's positive traits and acceptance of their negative traits, before really tapping into our feelings bank.

2920,57486,"Barely a week into the term, CS2040 and CS2040C have created quite a stir amongst students. 

Dijkstra reports.

Aikenot Dueet, a distraught 2040 student whom we found crying in a cubicle, told us how sorting has effectively screwed his life. ""At first, they sorted us by marks and assigned us letters based on a curve, and now, they are teaching us sorting while sorting us at the same time,"" weeped Aikenot.

We understand that students of this much dreaded course learn interestingly named sorting algorithms in the first few weeks, such as bubblesort, mergesort and quicksort. 

Despite being the humble algorithm it is, bubblesort embodies many of society's values. When a number is greater than the number on its immediate right, swapping happens. In layman terms, when one goes up, another has to go down. We'll discuss the socio-political significance of other algorithms in future reports.

Another student, Aino Laif, had a much more positive impression of 2040. He said, ""When finals ended, I felt as if my life no longer had any purpose. I was depressed by the lack of work and torture and even contemplated suicide. But thankfully, my depressing workless holiday was cut short by two weeks when my professor sent us an email asking us to do C++ problems or get sorted. That was the best new year of my life.""

Students of the school of Java have it much worse than their C++ counterparts as they are constantly reminded of the fact that their lives are public, static and void. Disciples of Source and survivors of 1101S were mortified to find mutation in almost every line of code they wrote. The uninformed had a nasty shock when they realised Java and JavaScript were two very different things.

A resigned student, Aikenever Dueet, told us, ""I joined CS with the hope of changing the world. Now, I guess I'll just be flipping pancakes for the rest of my living days.""

The aforementioned student wasn't enthused when we pointed out a sorting algorithm named after his potential career.

Meanwhile, our investigative journalists are busy finding connections, if any, between the 2040 instructors, the head of the state and the fountain of wealth. We hope to get back to you soon."

To me, this shows the epic failure of our education whereby the a respected institution condones and even endorses such wastage of resources.

2940,57455,"Regarding the discussion over NS, I want to highlight about the necessity of NS in Singapore’s context. Many commenters claimed NS is a form of deterrence, but is it really so? 

1. Our population is so small compared to other countries, even if we jack up the quantity using NS, do you think military quality is there? 

2. Our country is so small. Given the 21st century technological driven modern warfare, the mentality that modern military still invade via soldiers holding rifle and dagger is absurd. In a technological era, a war typically goes like this: missile and rocket attack followed by carpet bombing via plane. Then marine warship and submarine to seize control of navy space followed by isolation of Singapore from supply. 70% of attacks would be done without a single army soldier invader need to set foot on Singapore. 

Instead of having compulsory NS, a better deterrence is to use soft power. Forge international allies and make Singapore indispensable to them so that they will protect us. Look at Switzerland, they have such importance in banking such that even Nazi didn’t invade them during WW2.

Given the geographical and population constraint of a small country like us, the huge military budget and NS are very inefficient allocation of resources and waste of male Singaporean’s time. A better way to channel the money and time should be:

1. Learn from Switzerland. Carve out an international niche so that we are indispensable on the international stage. I believe as a small nation, we need to use our brain instead of sheer force (because we would never have enough brute force).

2. Invest in education. Send more male scholars overseas to forge ties with other powerful countries instead of wasting their 2 years in NS. 

3. If you really want defense, pump in more money into military R&D in DSTA to create revolutionary technology instead of making more combat ration and army credit to feed unwilling-to-serve NSF. 

This is the 21st modern war fate. Please don’t be naive and think you need sheer soldier numbers to serve as deterrence, this is not Ancient Rome where gladiator thrives. Even North Korea knows this and is trying so hard to invent long range ballistic missile and nuclear warhead to deter its US enemy. "

2973,57398,"To #57385 (quoting from various redditors) The outrage is due to the fact that a lot of the deaths are from normal everyday people acting soldiers, not a career soldier. A career soldier chose his life, chose to enter service, accepted the risks involved and are more invested in training in his career. 

But as NSmen, they are FORCED into the service against their will under threat of imprisonment. Unwilling part time soldiers are not the same as a highly trained career soldier.

Career soldiers get adequately compensated for their services. Sure, it's dangerous, but they're also earning risk pay and all the associated benefits of being a civil servant.

NSmen on the other hand just gets shafted hard from all directions. Do most work, most risk involved, least compensated, and above all, doing it not by choice, but because our nation needs us.

Okay, this may get very disgusting but I think this needs to get out there. I stay in RC, and there have been multiple cases where some person just doesn't have the intellectual capability of flushing their own feces! It is just beyond me that someone cannot do such a simple thing as flushing the toilet. A shared toilet is a public space, okay? This is just outrageous to get into a cubicle only to find a load of splattered discharge and dirty tissues inside the toilet bowl. (Just to be clear,) it doesn't need more than a glance to know what's inside the toilet bowl, I wasn't staring to identify those things.
To the irresponsible person(s) out there, do you know who you are being the most unfair to? The cleaners. You are being extremely inconsiderate to them for making them take care of your waste. I mean, you are a university student, you should have at least some common sense to flush. Just because they are paid to clean it doesn't mean that you should make their job miserable.

Please do not invalidate someone else's feelings just because you or someone you know is suffering from (what you feel is) something worse. Everyone is different. We have different ways of coping with problems we face and how many set backs we can deal with before we really really give up.

Of course, being residents of a first world country, on average, we are definitely more privileged than those living in circumstances worse than us. 

But self-harm is not something u can ""Grow up"" from. I don't think anyone who have attempted self-harm before and overcame it ever thought, ""I'm wiser and older now, I will no longer commit suicide like my younger foolish self would"". 

""I'm sure you are smart enough to understand that you have a choice."" 
What do you mean smart enough to understand that you have a choice? Please tell me what being smart has to do with anything mental health related? Have you actually met someone suicidal who decided ""No, I'm not going to kill myself because I'm smart and I know that suicide is choice."" ?? There are so many people who are struggling from different kinds of mental health illnesses that don't stem from so many problems that pile up in their lives. 

After reading your post I came to the conclusion that you do not value mental health as much as it should be valued. Perhaps you are not aware of the sigmatisation of people with mental illnesses in Singapore (and maybe in other countries too, but idk). So before you go around telling people to suck it up and appreciate life because it is worth living, why don't you actually read and understand the feelings of the OPs of the posts you've bashed?

To everyone reading this, when someone dear to you say things like ""I've only slept 3 hours today"" or ""I've skipped 2 meals today"", please refrain from one-upping them by saying ""I've slept less than you and I'm not complaining"".

Because luminus has definitely illuminated how white their pages are when they don't load/work! 

Oh wait, even the colour of the pages are depressing. 

I guess the new excuse for not paying attention or not submitting assignments shall be: I can't download any of the material for class because luminus isn't working. 

Here are some solutions if you wanted constructive criticism: 

1. At least duplicate the module information onto IVLE so students don't get triggered that luminus is the only platform that they can find their module information at (I still don't understand why some modules chose to fully transition into luminus when IVLE is at least  *a little* more stable; or at least I can load my pages????)

3. Be more efficient with your updates??

You do realise that some of us actually have to submit assignments, look at webcasts, or even download lecture materials in the ""coming weeks"" right? If you only fix the website mid-semester, how on earth are we supposed to study for our modules?

3037,57296,"I am in my final year at NUS and will be graduating soon. I remember reading some time back about some confessions of people (esp freshies) coming into uni and being worried about having no one to eat lunch with, don't want to be eating alone, etc. Personally, I've been not just ok with eating alone, but actually prefer to have my own time to myself to enjoy my food, amidst a sometimes busy and tiring timetable. Of course if I get jioed for lunch by friends I would happily accept and it's great to catch up with friends, new and old, over lunch too, but the point is that most of the time I eat by myself.

Which brings me to an article I read recently about the ""inescapable"" office work lunch culture in Singapore on rice media, and it makes me worried. Once I graduate and begin working it appears that there is an unspoken expectation in most places that you should join your co workers for lunch, even if you dont give a flying F about your colleague's wife or his kid is going to school and another 101 things. 

In uni there's no consequences for having lunch alone apart from some people's own self perception that it is awkward and they will get judged.

They seem to have this superiority complex when it comes to foreigners and they expect you to learn their language if you go to their country.
Ultimately, the only good thing I got out of my exchange experience was travelling around Europe. Germany felt like a social graveyard with with nothing much to offer.

As an Associate Professor in NUS School of Computing, Prof Ben is in a position of power.

Even if no un/conscious bias are involved during grading, it would be quite awkward during class if we have criticized him publicly in the past. Furthermore, Prof Ben have many friends/students/admirers who may be our present/future lecturers/friends/bosses and it's at least conceivable that some of them might view us disfavorably un/consciously because of the criticism. Indeed, a quick glance at the profiles of the people who publicly hold different views with Prof Ben using their real ID suggest that most of them have graduated and hence are more likely to be less pressured by Prof Ben's influence.

Guten Tag.
I've been on exchange in Germany before (Uni Heidelberg). I've got my culture shock too when I was there. I was seating at an empty seat where there were some books on the other side of a medium sized table, nobody was there then, in the university library. But when that student came back, she, a caucasian, said in German that she reserved the whole table, and shooed me away. 

Despite this incident, I don't put labels to the local culture and judge them using my own cultural values. If you intend to go to other parts of the world to open your eyes, then you have to be prepared for things that are not what you are not in alignment with your values. As an exchange student, I don't know why you are judging us by calling us ""really selfish"". This is not the open-mindedness Germans claim to embrace (die Aufgeschlossenheit). Entitled much? But then that's the attitude of the majority of young Germans I came across during my year there. "

I dont think that being slower is an advantage. To quote myself: ""I think for a start, you should feel happy that you are slower!"". One could be happy because of an advantage, but I meant it differently. 

For example, I was upset when I did CS2102 because it was simple to me as most of the challenging concepts are similar to CS1231. On the other hand, a person struggling with CS2102 could or even should be happy because it is an opportunity to properly learn the concepts in CS1231 that he/she might have missed out on. Doing well in CS2102 would be a positive feedback that they have learnt those material well. Instead of feeling discouraged when material gets hard, I think that being positive about the learning opportunities behind them will be helpful."

3079,57228,"#57198 yes... I'm surprised that some people actually think the culture of reserving seats is reasonable. They are sadly unaware of how selfish they are. yes, reserving seats save them from the trouble to find seats all around after getting food, but do they realize that the seats they reserve could have been used by other people who are just as anxiously looking for a seat?

3080,57226,"Hi all... Coming from a 过来人, I just wanna say, please leave your partner if he/she cheats on you. Don’t ever give him/her a second chance, ever!! 

My gf cheated on me when we were one year together. I wanna share with all of you about my experience, the type of tactics cheaters use with the ultimately goal of teaching you all so that hopefully there will be less heartbreaks in the world. 

Tactic 1: when I’m suspecting my gf cheating on me and I confront her, she will deny and shift the blame by accusing me back for not trusting her. When I had concrete evidence (photos, text messages), she was disappointed and accused me for invading her privacy (cos I checked her phone to get the evidence). Basically, she will divert her wrongdoing and accuse something else back in an attempt to fight back the argument. 

Trait 2: she will use phrases such as “turn over a new leaf”, “forgive and forget”, “don’t hold grudge”, “what’s done is done” and “look forward in life” to dismiss her cheating. She also claimed “love is unconditional and I should accept her for who she is”. If I can’t forgive her over a moment of folly, how are we gonna face all the obstacles in future? Love means to accept everything unconditionally. 

Trait 3: I forgive her but she cheated on me again 2 months later. When I found out, she claimed I’m not open minded enough and said “cmon, it’s the 21st century, not back in the 80s”. If I don’t accept her for who she is, i don’t deserve her. Alternatively, she will play victim by blaming alcohol.

It’s really hell for me and I finally managed to break free from her. It might be scary to be alone, especially since you have invested so much into the relationship. But to people in similar situation, please just break away, trust me... it’s the best thing you can do. 

Please don’t be naive and believe in phrases like “turn over a new leaf” or “forgive and forget”. Instead, remember “a leopard can never change its spot”. Casual sex (be it player, cheater, fwb or one night stand) goes to show a lot about a person’s character and self control. There’s no benefit dating people with such history. It will only put you at risk. I’m not saying it’s true 100% of the time that people with such history are unfaithful. But the probability is higher. Since nothing is 100% in this world.  The best you should do is to be wise and minimize this probability unless you really have no other better suitor. "

3082,57224,"Re: scootering in an earlier post, a lot is about how the scooters are used. 

Yes, the paths are narrow but not that narrow. So theoretically, pedestrians and scooters can peacefully co-exist. Presuming we split the pavement into two 'lanes', the pedestrians can keep to one 'lane' and scooters keep to the other 'lane' right?

But in real life, that's not what happens. Multiple times I have seen scooters being ridden side-by-side, so you see two or three scooters blocking up the whole lane. Or a pedestrian is in one lane, and the scooter is in the exact same lane, going fast and not changing lane. I guess they just expect the pedestrian to avoid them? 

No one wants a head-on collision, so if you're riding a scooter, please switch lanes earlier. And please do not block the whole lane by riding side-by-side with your friends. That is what truly pushes pedestrians onto walking on the bike lane.

Someone brought up 'scooter-bashing', but seriously, if scooterists(?) practice some courtesy and pedestrians do too, then both parties wouldn't be so unhappy. And yeah don't be that guy who swears at someone irl just for being a pedestrian. "
3083,57223,"Had breakfast today with my boyfriend, and saw an old teammate of mine. Okay, not really teammate, but we used to play floorball together and we're kinda friends.

Seeing him today made me feel strange for some reason. We didn't have much of a relationship, maybe a couple of hookups when in JC after he broke up with his then-gf, but nothing more than that and that was it. We didn't see the need to continue seeing each other, and we had one of those friendships that died out.

We're both in NUS, and though we no longer play floorball together, I still do see him around with his friends and girlfriend, since our faculties are pretty close together.

I guess it's just a sense of longing I guess, but since this morning I've started unconsciously comparing this relationship to the other one.

3086,57220,"There are so many people using the Grab scooters right now. They go quite fast and, combined with their numbers and with the narrow pavements, I'm often forced to walk in the bike lane next the moving vehicles.

Also, there was one guy who apparently couldn't use a scooter and move it in a straight path, so he kept zig-zagging down the pavement. Then he had the nerve to yell ""chao chibai!"" at me for existing on the same pavement and thus, I suppose, making his weak attempts at scootering harder. You'd think college students would be more mature than that, but I find myself constantly questioning that stance.

That rude guy aside, this scooter problem is even worse on campus than outside of it. I understand that it gets people around campus faster, but why wasn't a thought ever spared for pedestrians when this was considered for approval? I find it ironic for pedestrians to be sometimes pushed onto the bike lanes, while the scooters never use the bike lane.  "

In the academic world, I could be considered as a relatively successful person. However, in relationship matter, I always confused with the definition of 'love'. Eventually, instead of keep clarifying what love is, I decided to act just based on my surface consciousness and impulse. I confess to someone that I love him/her without further analysing whether I actually love him/her or understand what love is.
Unfortunately, things didn't come out as I expected. The worst case scenario happens: It wasn't he/she rejected me; I didn't even get the chance to tell him/her that I love him/her before he/she indirectly shut me up.

Allow me state the obvious - You are decreasing the total number of seats while you queue for your food. If no one reserves seats, more seats will be filled with people consuming their meal, and moving off after they are done. It is less likely that there will be a shortage of seats, even though the lunch crowd population is constant each day.

Reserving seats is inconsiderate, and comparing this practice with bad practices from other countries does not make it any less inconsiderate. Any sufficiently large group of humans will have good and bad practices, and correspondingly, good and bad people. I think it is time to get rid of this bad practice."
3100,57196,"Being inclusive is one of the most fundamental forms of respect we can offer to those around us.

Belonging to one of the minority races, I received a rude shock upon entering NUS last year, having last experienced this only in primary school. I thought certain people from the majority race would have outgrown this to become more mature individuals with a good awareness of their surroundings. Unfortunately not so.

Initially, when I had groupmates speaking to each other in Mandarin I did not really take it very seriously, because they were mostly one to one conversations that I was not very keen to get involved in. However, during committee discussions when I was the only minority present, nearly half the discussions took place in Chinese. 

Of course I did think of reminding them of the presence of a non-Chinese. Amidst the boisterous chattering (all in Mandarin), however, I felt small. I hesitated, believing that my tiny voice would go unheard among the laughs and giggles. 

I do see that this is not done with racist intentions. I understand that certain parts of speech or humor can be conveyed more accurately and intensely in Mandarin as compared to English, because I experience it with my own mother tongue as well. But at the expense of offending others??

I am not saying that people should not speak in Chinese before me. But it would be respectful to just TRY to translate, if not, a simple apology would do as it shows us that you recognise and respect our presence. Is that so hard??

I am glad that I have not really experienced this from people within my major itself, but it is something that I suppose should be changed. Maybe it is not of much importance to the majority race since some of you may not even have experienced it. But it will definitely bring more joy to us, minorities."

Life has a way of making people suffer for the weirdest of things. What was supposed to bring joy and support, ended up turning into something that brought pain and emotional turmoil.

It sucks more that we are the ones that have to suffer the brunt of it.  I hope you're coping well. Or at least better than I am. While it pains to have this barrier, it's something I have to agree with you. We do need this. The constant suffocation was doing us both dirty and it's hightime we both did something about it. I don't deny the bitterness though. 

Hopefully, we can get over this stupid wall we've built for ourselves and come back stronger.

3105,57188,"Pardon me, my example is using the average Singaporean male as an example, but the same can be applied to females as well.

Given that:
- the average life expectancy is around 81 years old for males
- Singaporean males generally start working at around age 24
- the CPF contribution rate is around 32%

The average Singaporean male would work for 41 years until retirement at age 65.

Assuming that annual income is about 48,000, without any increment or bonus.
- Someone working 41 years would make around 1,968,000.
- Total CPF contribution would be around 629,760.

Now, assuming zero interest rate, and ignoring changing CPF contribution rate, and one spends all income earned excluding CPF.
- One would spend about 1,338,240 over 41 years; which is about 32,640 per year.

Assuming at retirement, someone spends 32,640 per year.
- CPF should be enough to cover at least 629,760 / 32,640 = 19 years.

If the CPF monthly payout age is at 65, the age when your CPF runs out of money is 84 years old.
Even without including interest, this is 3 years above the average life expectancy.

-------------

Note that my calculations are not overly optimistic or pessimistic, for example:
- You can use X as annual income (I used 4,000 a month as average).
  - As long as you are spending within your means, you are OK.

- CPF has a default 2.5% annual interest rate.
  - Using the example above, at the end of 41 years, the total amount in CPF would be around 1,088,648.
  - Or, in terms of years, you would be able to pay for 33 years of expenditure.

- By retirement, you should be able to own your HDB flat.
  - Thus, you would probably spend less after retirement.

Conclusion: there is no reason to increase the CPF payout age."

It's true people catch feelings for another person while currently being attached.

This is even worse when your partner catches feelings for someone in your close friend circle and neither of them tell you anything. You find out the truth in the worst way possible- you find out that your friend had even proposed to your partner from other friends.

Well, this was me. I know it's understandable that people catch feelings for another while currently being attached. But my request to these people is that, if you respect your partner even a little bit and value their emotions, please open up to them. It's hard enough as it is to hear your partner likes someone else, but to find out about this from other people, it gets much more difficult to move on.

And one more thing to note, it doesn't matter what your senior wrote wor; it is best to check with your TA what he/she wants. Sometimes, they are looking for certain specifics and things they goes through during class, that are those answers that should at least be in the report. If you only wrote from senior's report and miss out those points, you aren't gonna do well.

It is perfectly alright to have negative feelings or to reveal your desires. Why do you feel the need to hide them? It may be unhealthy to experience resentment every day, but it is less tiring than to put up a fake image in front of other people. 

Be ambitious, not for self interest for but those who are in need. You will find a lot more joy and aoppreciation in life that way. "

Most NUS Profs see you as an investment (to train) and therefore do not see any benefit from serving as your referee when you apply for overseas universities. Your My former NUS Prof actually told me I would be better off remaining as his/her technician/RA than doing a PhD abroad. 

Just look for another referee from your undergrad or do another internship.  A good potential PhD supervisor will overlook the lack of a reference from your MSc supervisor, if you have a proper explanation. Keep your head up and don't look back."

LSM2191 is see luck. If your TA is very strict in marking reports, you die (Strict in comparison to other groups). I remember when I took the module, there was a TA who failed half of her group for report 1. No give chance at all. Some TA are more lenient and will help us tackle those questions in the practical notes such that we can at least pass or if we give valid reasons that are logical despite lousy lab results, we can still get good grades. 

And one more thing to note, it doesn't matter what your senior wrote wor; it is best to check with your TA what he/she wants. Sometimes, they are looking for certain specifics and things they goes through during class, that are those answers that should at least be in the report. If you only wrote from senior's report and miss out those points, you aren't gonna do well.

Then again, if your TA can't teach properly or forget to go through some stuff, you die. So see luck and pray hard. Quite a fun module to do.

2) In addition, are exams at TU/e really that difficult to pass, even more than NUS exams?

Hey, considering that you're still a 2nd year student, I'll say not to give up on trying to attain that 2nd upper-you still have a decent stretch to go, although yes, it may be hard. 
Regarding your question: I'm actually just a y4 psychology student, so I can't say what exactly it is like out there regarding the competition for masters. However, I've been talking to people and professors and what they say seem to converge on one point which is that: it is really hard for you to be even considered for masters with a 2nd lower. While that's not to say that it is impossible, chances are not high. In the event that you do end up with a 2nd lower, make sure you complete a thesis by all means first. I've heard that many places do not even look at your application if you have not completed a thesis. Then do whatever you can to beautify your resume--publish a paper (maybe your thesis with your professor), take up jobs/volunteering/interns etc relating to the field.

I was rather callous, sarcastic, and uncaring at times. Things started peeling off; over a long period of time.

Then it's the ""let's take a break from each other"". A month later, breakup. There were tear, drunkenness, bitterness. etc ...

Our relationship had lots of ups and down. We had sex, then we stopped. Why we stopped was because of a stupid argument (my bad). In short, she wanted to do it bareback during her period and I don't. I was a hypochondriac and when I knew she had unprotected sex with her bf, I was reluctant to do the same with her afterwards. I tried to played it as ""it's not that I don't trust you; I don't trust your ex"". it somehow ended as ""OK, let's not do it"" but because we were horny af, we continued with everything else.

To the RVRC Management Team, I believe it wouldn't hurt to improve such serious hygiene issue by simply placing a sign around the coolers that ""WATER COOLERS ARE FOR DRINKING PURPOSES ONLY"".

However, recently I came to know a girl whom kinda likes me. I think she would be my gf if I were to work on it a little. It would also solve all the questions about my lack of gf and my dream to have children.

3233,56991,"#56991: Your Prof clearly doesn't have your best interests at heart. It happened to me too. Most NUS Profs see you as an investment (to train) and therefore do not see any benefit from serving as your referee when you apply for overseas universities. Your My former NUS Prof actually told me I would be better off remaining as his/her technician/RA than doing a PhD abroad. 

Just look for another referee from your undergrad or do another internship.  A good potential PhD supervisor will overlook the lack of a reference from your MSc supervisor, if you have a proper explanation. Keep your head up and don't look back."

3235,56989,"In reply to #56980 —

OP of #56959 here; I'm aware of all the problems the other OP listed; that's *exactly* why I said 'albeit with a few caveats'.

My point, however, had nothing to do with NUS having an appeal system, or NUS having tutorial balloting, or SMU not refunding points, etc. For all the accusations that I've committed a logical fallacy, I think OP of #56980 has done the same thing— they have built a straw man. 

I only brought SMU up at the end as an example; my key (and only) point was that NUS' bidding/balloting is scheduled too late, to the extent that it ends well past the start of the semester, and that my personal belief (with incomplete information, of course—I don't work at the Registrar's Office) was that NUS could bring the entire process forward (perhaps starting shortly after results release) without affecting any of CORS' features, like appeals, point refunds, balloting, etc. 

Nevertheless, all this discussion is in vain, because CORS will be scrapped starting the next academic year. I thoroughly expect a mess for at least the next two semesters as teething issues are fixed and the dust settles.

3239,56983,"The other side of the story #56983- 
It's true people catch feelings for another person while currently being attached. But have you ever been the bf/gf who completely trusts your partner, actively tries working on the relationship because you love them and yet, are kept in the dark by the same person you trusted and valued so much. This is even worse when your partner catches feelings for someone in your close friend circle and neither of them tell you anything. You find out the truth in the worst way possible- you find out that your friend had even proposed to your partner from other friends.

Well, this was me. I know it's understandable that people catch feelings for another while currently being attached. But my request to these people is that, if you respect your partner even a little bit and value their emotions, please open up to them. It's hard enough as it is to hear your partner likes someone else, but to find out about this from other people, it gets much more difficult to move on.

Recently found out that one of my close friends proposed to my gf and that she likes him and was leading him on. Seems like my whole world is crumbling down. Is it possible to move on?

CS seniors what are your thoughts on taking cs2030 during special term vs next year sem 1?"
3241,56979,"I want to add on to #56959's rant about the current system. Having round 3 bidding and tutorial balloting happening after school starts just adds unnecessary frustration. 

Module bidding: For students unfortunate to not get what they want within rounds 1 & 2 or those who want to overload, being forced to wait till round 3 is just plain stupid, and it almost feels like you're being neglected by the school just because most people have already got what they need.

Tutorial balloting: After getting our lecture slots, we'll already be going to school and listening to lectures. But then having to deal with the time sensitive add drop swaps during the final round WHILE in school makes it kind of hard to focus in lectures, particularly for those who desparately need it.

Some of these concerns/details may be small, but it's the small things that add up to make NUS a better place for students. And besides it just makes sense to have all the timetables fixed before school starts, is it that hard? "

well the thing is. ever since i am aware of what my dad has been doing, i find it difficult to trust guys at all. even when my guy was just talking a bit too much to my friend, i went berserk inside, thinking that he is cheating on me. i tried really hard to convince myself that there is nothing going on, but the thoughts of my dad cheating just keeps coming back to me. it is hard to believe that anyone can love just one person forever. i really just want to trust my guy and not worry about any bitch that starts talking to him but i can't and i don't think it is possible for me to trust anyone at all. this is really unfair because i already suffered so much in childhood and this shit follows me into adulthood and possibly forever..."
3245,56971,"Hi, does anyone know if Get1028 Logic lectures are webcasted?"
3246,56970,"Hi. This is for those wanting to take GEH1036 Living with Mathematics but not concerned with difficulty or bell-curve:
""The objective of this course is to exhibit some simple mathematical ideas that permeate a modern society and to show how a reasonably numerate person can use these ideas in everyday life and, in the process, gain an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematical ideas. ""
(This is found in CORS or the module description in the math department website)

Looking at the above paragraph, one can infer the module will certainly be easy as long as you know a bit of math. This claim can be corroborated easily by asking whoever has taken the module before. However this module has no preclusion, so anyone can take it. That is if you are willing to pay for it as module quota often fills up quickly.

Reason why I am doing this is that I feel one should not think that this module is not for him/her just because the bell curve is too steep, or it is hard to get a good grade for it. (or any other reason that is similar to what I wrote). Rather, you may want to consider whether you are appreciative of what is taught in the module that shapes the modern society today. I believe this is the primary learning outcome of this module, no different to any other GE module you know of. I'm hoping you want to take modules you are more interested in, and not just getting an easy A on your transcript.

TLDR: Are you interested in the CONTENT of GEH1036? If yes then go ahead and read it. Do not be put off by the bell curve.

They don't put down how special programmes work so by now I've missed the deadline because they vaguely put down when you should apply without specifying what your progress should be by then.

3288,56908,"So something has been bugging me since the year started and I just wanted to gather suggestions on what I should do. 

My boyfriend’s ex is like a 打不死的蟑螂. They broke up in 2016, a year before he got together with me, but this bitch somehow just refuses to stop contacting him. Mind you, she got attached pretty soon after they broke up and she was the one who showed disinterest in the relationship months leading up to the break up. In the one year period when I haven’t entered the picture, (my bf told me that) she would text him occasionally pretending that things were like before, asking him out for lunch etc, even when he has already made it very clear that he wants a clean break and doesn’t want anything to do with her anymore. It even escalated to the point where she told him she’s sex deprived, which just made him speechless (lol probably cause her bf is in army). 

The last time she texted him was in Dec 2017 (when we just got together) and asked if he was free for dinner, but he just coldly replied that he wasn’t free. So I thought she was out of our lives for good, until a couple days before NYE. It was 3am in the morning and she sent 2 text full of typos (took us awhile to decipher what she was trying to say), wishing for him to last long and thanking him for the lesson (???). He did not bother replying her.

It might be overthinking on my part and maybe I’m reading too much into the texts…… but some womanly instinct tells me there’s something more to them than it seems. SHE KEEPS APPEARING EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN’T ENTERTAIN HER. Plus, she is still attached till date -- which is why all these doesn’t make sense to me. And just imagine if her bf finds out she is still contacting her ex… lol. Thinking from a woman’s perspective, I really really really don’t know what she is trying to get out of this. 

I have considered sharing my insecurities with my boyfriend. We are very open and share literally everything with each other. But honestly, what do I expect him to say? None of this is his fault and there’s nothing he can do also. I’m afraid I might make him feel bad for making me feel insecure also. 

Is there anything I can do or say to make this stop? To make her truly vanish? I mean, I know her number and her Instagram, if it matters.

night and day,
if you have the slightest clue 
how I feel. 

Every time you sit next to me,
butterflies, and the tiniest ray
of hope,
because there are other options.
Better, more sensible options.
 
And every time you look at me,
and I look back,
you don't just look away,
not anymore,
and I think I see it in your eyes
when you hold my gaze.

And we can talk for hours 
when hanging out,
alone or with friends,
so I thought 
we might have something special,
something rare,
for I've never been so comfortable
with someone I've known so little.

But people see what they wanna see.
If you really cared the same way,
you would have shown some interest,
some real initiative of your own.
I am tired of texting first.
You too can ask me about my day,
and not just in passing when running into me... 

So while waiting
for your wonderfly brilliant,
but dense head
to pick up the hint,
I realise, 
it would seem,
that the only dense one here
who needs to take a hint,
is me.

However, the longer I've known him, the more A comes off really bitchy - unsure if sometimes he's intentionally bitchy or just his tone of speech. I told my close friend, B, about A, who said that guys probably didn't like A, hence they just shunned him and girls most of the time wouldn't reject talking to guys like A. This thus results in A having more female friends than male friends. What do you guys think? Is A just weird or it's his personal preference in making more female friends? "

I can't remember if I appeal for it, but I managed to map Finance, Financial Markets, and another finance module for SEP at UK. I was an accountancy undergraduate, so I was only allowed to map non accounting modules for exchange (which could be why NUS allowed me to do it concurrently). 

If you were in a similar situation as me, you can try too. You may also want to email the professors for your pre-req & post req modules, to get the relevant materials in advance. Pre-req modules can be simple and Cap does not include exchange modules, but it is important to get your basics firm.

As a phd whose course and advice is so sort after, its doubly important that he provides a well thought out and supported opinion. As a phd I expect him to know the value of such opinion. So far from what I have read he hasnt done that. And EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, as a UNIVERSITY student you should never have an unquestioning attitude towards your professors. University is about critical thinking and increasing the standards of general thinking, not blindly admiring professors who may end up feeding you shit knowledge.

3413,56679,"Let's admit it! Social Media is a deadly tool to kill us.

Hi #56679, first and foremost, i am in no acquaintance to Ben Leong. Neither do i know him personally  nor ever interact with him once. The only impression he left in me is when i am eating my chicken chop in biz/soc canteen and I saw him talking to himself in his deep thoughts walking towards one of the stalls there. So my opinions below will be a fair and neutral ... 

As far as I know, one of the main reason why fewer profs or even working adults prefer to engage or to express their opinions through social media is because social media is one of a way to lose your job. Not only does it happen here, it happens anywhere around the globe. Many professionals lost their job through ridiculously and shameless posting in the pasts. (Don't come and ask me for citation., You don't know how to google yourselves ah ? ). If a person willing to engage a discussion openly in social media, it is quite stressful too because you have to be very careful in your words and fear that people will quote your words to insinuate for another thing. Thus, that could be one of the reason why lesser profs are willing to comments in NUSWhispers. Thus, do empathize if Ben Leong is willing to post and share his views. Not many profs willing to do that. 

As far as I concern, Ben Leong is just voicing out his opinions and in NUSWhispers, there are no right or wrong answers. Hey come on, this is NUSWhispers where all sorts of truths and trolls appear. This is not a true forum where academics matters come into place. People posts all sorts of questions and comments such as orgy relationships, bleach armpits, complaints etc... Everybody have the freedom to posts and comments as such. If you do not agree to one-saying, it is totally fine to do that. Nobody is forcing you to trust anyone in NUSWhispers. I do not trust Ben either because I do not even know him at all but i think it is good to always open your minds and listen to others. Whether to follow or not to, depends on one's decision after consideration. Similar analogy, you go downstair coffeeshop buy meepok dry. The uncle recommend say meepok wet is better because all guys like wet stuff. First thoughts in mind, you will also not trust the uncle because you do not know him at all but you will listen and consider it with your own thoughts to come up with a conclusion whether you like it to be wet or not right? 

Secondly, it is really naive and immature to expect others to keep feeding you with citation and research. Do your own homework and make your own decision yourselves. So if you intend to challenge the uncle for meepok wet, you expect the uncle to give you citation and research of how good his meepok wet is ? And technology is a very diversify knowledge that has no boundary. Valve, SAP or Linux is good but it does not signifies everything about technology. For example, again on our meepok analogy. You think that putting chilli to meepok is the best but instead, there are also chopped spring onions, deep-fried shallots or tomato to make it a perfect meepok dish in the F&B industry.

Lastly, you got to respect and give it to someone who have good credential It is not easy to finish a PHD. It really takes alot of wetness such as sweat and blood to finish a PHD. You can disagree to his comments but you should have a basic courtesy, humbleness and respect to someone who flair better than you. Even when i am typing this one, I might not even be able to obtain a position from MIT. Many success comes with lots of hard work and wetness behind the scene. You think everything drop from the sky one ah?

Like i said, nobody ask you to trust every post online or to trust anybody. Of course you are free to post whatever you like in NUSWhispers but I do challenge you that if you wish to post, comments it below so we are able to know who you are and will ""try to listen to your advice on your future posts"" because we are all from humble origins. 

Okie... I am going to buy my meepok wet. KthxBye!"

3436,56641,"Having an existential crisis is like not knowing what to eat for dinner. You ask other people what they like to eat, but then their answer is always not good enough for you. You want to find the ""one true meal"" that is going to be universally enjoyed by everyone and end up starving for the night because you are too busy nitpicking every single option without trying any of them, while other people got to enjoy their dinner, imperfect or otherwise. 

The fact is, people don't sit in bed all day philosophizing and then suddenly decides that ""XXX is my favorite food"". They also don't go around asking people ""eh whats your favorite food"" and say ""Well your argument on why KFC is your favorite food is the most logically sound. KFC is therefore my favorite food"". That's not how it works. You'll have to try before you choose, and you're not gonna have the luxury to try everything.

Secondly, there is an increasing demand for people with Computer Science knowledge. As a Mathematician, I get stuck in the middle of nowhere with just basic CS or Python knowledge. 

Thirdly, Mathematics is a difficult subject, take it only if you have the passion or intend to do further studies, preferably alongside with a Minor. (You must be the type who has a CAP close to 5.0 or no-go)

I study really hard, but it seems like I can never cover everything... and when I enter the exam hall it just feels like I didn't study at all....

I feel frustrated how we learn stuff that are outdated simply because it is difficult to restructure a whole univeristy degree course. It may be less of a problem for engineering students, but for business Profs, how many of them have actually climbed the corporate ladder, learnt the real-world skills and are able to provide quality, pragmatic advice to business students or future entrepreneurs? Some business students I know are seeking external mentors out of the university to cover up this gap and to learn more, but if that is so, what is the point of a university? To get a degree to flow with the system? I guess. 

Can someone advise me on how to go about this? I can't focus 100% of my effort into learning my modules knowing that I will probably forget them and not use them 10 years later in my career."

So I ghosted him but he then confronted me about it. 

I didn't want to reject him when he haven't actually said he liked me, embarrassing the both of us. (+the possibility of our group outings to turn awkward because of that). But just when I thought he had finally gotten the hint he got more ""aggressive"" and keeps messaging me about random things everyday. He even asks questions like ""how has your day been?"" and ""do u want to have lunch together sometime?"" and ""where are you now?"" 

Also he keeps initiating body contact like touching my shoulders and upper arms, and I am very uncomfortable with it.

3489,56563,"Hello! I need some advice with regards to my studies.

I'm a freshman majoring in Mathematics, but I'm always at a loss whenever someone asks me what I want to be in the future. Honestly, I chose math 'cause I'm good at it and am confident to get at least A- in MA modules... but career-wise, I'm not so inclined towards banking/finance-related jobs, and after experiencing the horrors of high school I don't know if I want to be in the education sector.

Which is why I'm thinking of picking up a minor, to hopefully equip me with the knowledge and skills in other industries. In particular, I'm interested in the drug-manufacturing industry and am considering to take a minor in pharm sci. But I'm not sure how useful this would be? How difficult is it to get a job in the drug-manufacturing industry?

On the other hand, I might consider taking a minor in CS too, since my I did well for my CS1010S. Should I minor in CS instead? (Or maybe switch majors?)

TLDR: How's the drug-manufacturing industry like right now and in the future? Will a minor in pharm sci help me to land a job in that industry?

3491,56561,"It is common wisdom that the civil service emphasises more on honours classification compared to private sector during hiring. What is unclear are the defining characteristics of graduates from each category. Having worked with over 50 graduates, an admixture of first class honours, seconds and the occasional valedictorian, maybe I can shed a better light on this matter.

In general, firsts are way more productive than their peers over the long run. This is because they are able to identify deeply hidden issues and solve them well before they unfold into a terrible mess. Or offer a seemingly innocuous solution which attack a problem from multiple fronts. For example, there was a first on my team who discovered an O(nlog(n)) technique to accelerate an O(n^2) computational bottleneck which has persisted in some of our systems for years. This allows the product to work with larger datasets and have better performance. Firsts are suited for highly complex tasks and open-ended problems. For repetitive tasks, they perform no better than the rest. Firsts are slightly lower in trait conscientiousness and may not successfully follow through with a prolonged task. There is no significant difference between valedictorians and firsts.

Second uppers are highly intelligent and reasonably conscientious, making them suitable for technical teamwork. They are not as adept as firsts in identifying root causes of difficult problems, or offer novel solutions that are able to substantially cut costs or increase revenues over the long run. Given a reasonable objective with no major hiccups, they can bring projects to successful fruition.

Second lower and below is where productivity becomes negative for non-trivial technical work. The cost of training and losses incurred due to poor design choices can easily outweigh the value that is delivered. They are more suited for repetitive work with moderate deviation from SOP. It's not all gloom and doom though, some of the most reliable team members that I can count on falls within this category."

3505,56543,"I'd love to hear Prof. Ben Leong's career advice.

I spent most of my 20s working in low paid jobs (6 years as a research assistant at NUS and another year at startups), and earned a Masters as well. I finally landed a relatively well-paying data science / data engineering job at a finance firm when i was nearly 30, where I have been for the last 3 years. 

I'm now trying to figure out what's next for me. The most appealing option right     is to actually start to independent contracting as a data science / machine learning developer. I already have prospective clients lined up. My day job has gotten to a point where I barely need to work 5-10 hours a week to be effective, so i certainly have enough time and bandwidth for pursuing side contracts. 

If it goes well, I'm contemplating rebranding myself as an independent developer who always works on a contract basis. I regularly get inquiries and job offers for senior dev / tech lead roles, and I feel like there is a fairly good chance of being able to parlay them into independent contracts.

Now come the financial considerations: this route seems quite lucrative, at least in the short term. My day job pays 200k a year. The 2 prospective clients for the side gig can pay 200k / 100k each, so i'll probably earn around 400-500k all in. If I quit my job and go independent, I'm hoping to keep at least 2 clients at a time and make ~ 450k a year on average.

My concern is if this is a good long term move. Will doing this hurt my prospects of moving up the corporate ladder? Do I risk stretching myself too thin and burning out in the long term? Would it be better for me to shore up my interviewing skills and try to land a job in one of the GAFAs? As an independent dev, my income ceiling probably around 400-500k: will I lose out on potentially earning more than that in a corporate setting? Should I build up more of a history of working in industry before trying independent contracting?

I must add that I don't want to work in the US, because I don't want to deal with their immi.

3508,56539,"[WARNING: Long post] Hi everyone, I have been a reader of NUSWhispers since the NUS-Confessions day and this post is dedicated to those whose CAP is below 3 in SOC. //Cannot use the term struggling cos there are who complain that they are struggling for FCH and I was just struggling to get Bs back then

A little about myself: I graduated from SOC in 2003 and still have memories of modules like CS1231, CS1232, CS1101, CS1102 (my days only got java, no Python), CS2012, CS2013 , CS2014, CS2015, CS2016, CS3103, CS3243 (AI at my time no deep learning and machine learning), CS3214 (java web application, those days no iOS and Android) and some others that I cannot remember. Most importantly, I was tanking the bottom of the bell curve throughout my 3 years in SOC. My CAP was 2.38 in Y1S1 and I graduated with a CAP of 3.15 om Y3S2. 

My time also no option of S/U and also no Prof Ben. He joined NUS in 2014++ and was probably in MIT doing my NUS days if I remember correctly. So you guys are really fortunate compared to my time. Things could have been different for me if I had S/U option then. Anyway, I have been working in sales (Non-IT related) since I graduated. I dun earn a lot but I draw a reasonable income (between 100K to 150K per annum for the last 7-8 years)

My main message to those who will probably miss 2nd lower class honour and below is this: Dun be despair cos the CS training will STILL give you a competitive edge in life WHEN you are working outside IT industry. You just have to start with a lower position and pay as your degree may not be relevant in the new industry. The CS skill that you have will make you realised that things can be done more efficiently than they already are once you understand how the system works. This will enable you to be a valuable asset in the company because you are able to do so much more compared to many of your fellow colleagues with the same time given

If you are going to be working for an organisation, then I would recommend these you pick up excel skill (VBA or formulas). Working with big CSV files and functions such as vlookup, match, indirect, create a variable range and privot tables are just a few that really help you in your work. Your CS1101 training will enable you to create Excel sheets that are ""very impressive"" to other but just actually ""so-so"" to you.

If you are going to be self-employed or startup. Then learn about web hosting with WordPress, SEO (make sure you read on the black hats too!),  Facebook marketing, video marketing. You can also learn about business analytics and Microsoft Power BI but I feel that they are only useful for big organisations with lots of data.

Lastly, dun forgot how to code. I am using selenium in java and PDF library to automate boring tasks and prepare data for my presentations nowadays. It really saves me a lot of time and yet impresses my clients 

TLDR: Not doing well in CS is not the end of the world. The closing of one door is just an opening to another. If you are going to miss the FCH and 2nd upper, why not consider building some of the skill that I have mentioned above? Study what interests you (like I did) for the remaining modules and you would enjoy more of your uni life. At least got more time BGR right!

I've graduated from NUS Computer Science over 1 year ago, and I was quite a ghost in school. Simply study, go for exams and do internships, but didn't partake in any school activities during uni. Most of my entertainment in school was computer games.

After 1 and a half year of working in the industry largely dominated by males, I find that I am trapped in a cycle of work-eat-sleep and nothing will possibly change in the next N years if I don't make any deliberate changes to my lifestyle.

I understand that the common advice for meeting/dating girls is to start speaking to them or casually making female friends. But this does not seem quite feasible at all in most tech companies since it's really >95% guys.

I am really lost and would hope for some advice on ways to start."

3528,56504,"Hi Juniors, the same Graduated Senior here who warned potential tech bubble & hiring freeze that will impact students hoping to be  be a tech professional.


Since the post garner sizable likes for a serious post & I assume that there is an interest to understand the whole industry bubble formation and collapse. Let you judge yourself if you are still not convinced. Those who haven't read the previous post ; I have first and experience before as a chemical engineering graduate who saw the oil market crash when I was graduating and  I was my Friends who lost their job in the first 3 months of graduation.

It generally start with generally start with some technology innovation (lik shale gas extraction or cheap computing power enabling deep learning) , or the government wants to introduce or drive a new sector ( like the smart nation initiative ) to climb the economic ladder where the country shift from primary & secondary sector to tertiary & quarternary sectors. You may have heard the line somewhere ""we must be innovation driven nation"". It is  a natural progression for economies.

Then the market players & new companies form and come in the country and the professional command a high salary simply because the lack of necessary talent. Initiative are made to train talent into the industry like skillfutures to meet the market need. The high salary and hype/glamour generated by the industry attracts careers switches and students into the industry. 

Universities later coming into fill in the gap with new courses and increased cohort size. Now we have biz analytics , last time we had quantitative finance introduced prior to the 2008 financial crisis. You see the hype and hear mouth watering salary that your seniors told you and it drives young people into the course. You see indicative grade profile shooting up for the course. Look at CS course over the past ten years. Students start dreaming of the bring future wait for them. Being unnecessarily cocky. 

Your senior's salary is not an indicator of your salary. (At least for most of you)
 
Then, the bubble matures as more & more people come in. The industry then has enough talent to be super competitive given the abundances of talent. You can see how hard is the exams to join some of the companies even though the job is not that hard. Innovation slows downs and market overvalues the companies.

Later, for some reason bubble pops like oil bubble was the shale gas and OPEC price war. 2008 crisis was the ugly mortgage back securities held by banks. Something will happen and the companies become more conservative and cost their cosr. Aka layoffs, buy companies that didn't do well and fire excess staff & cut down graduate hiring. Why you need graduate when you have so many professionals available to choose from.

I'm point is simple. Don't join any course merely because it is hot. Someone gonna get burnt. If I asked my grandparents, they will say shipping but you get the point.
At any moment of time there will be a hot industry. in the past, various industries had been hot, shipping chemical sectors, microelectronics,  pharma , finance and now tech. Your seniors salaries has not bearing on you. Finally, don't be cocky. You are not the one earning those salary:p

3529,56502,"We first met at a lab session during our first year when you asked me a question about the session and I could not answer it. I was too mesmerised by your big beautiful eyes at that time. We started talking and then dating and we celebrated my birthday together that year. You bought for me a chocolate cake which is the best cake I have ever had. We did so many things together and watched each other grew up - from poor undergraduates to working professionals. We supported each other - or rather u supported me more than I did for you. 

And I regret it wholeheartedly. I should have been there for you every day, every minute, every second. I should have treasured you more than I did every day, every minute, every second. I should have told you that I love you every day, every minute, every second. 

I wonder if you know about the numerous nights that I have cried to myself to sleep because I regret losing your heart forever. I wonder if you know how I have tried meeting other girls but I am constantly reminded of you - until I have given up on finding anyone else. I wonder if you know how I am avoiding those places which hold so much memories for us - parks like west coast park where we celebrated our first valentine day together, malls where we constantly hang out after school, restaurants we used to frequent because we love eating. I wonder if you know how much I wish I could travel back in time to our happier moments - those days at Korea University, those days when we went hunting for students deals as broke undergraduate days, those days when we went to queue for stuff like Llao Llao because you had the craving for it, those days when we travelled to Asian countries because we were poor undergraduates who cannot afford to travel further, those days when we were travelling in Europe and could finally afford those small travelling luxuries, those days when we were simply happy because we were together.

You may not be the most beautiful, smartest or nicest girl in the world. But to me, you are the most beautiful, smartest and nicest girl forever. You are the one whom I want to share my life with and grow old together with. I wished I had told you so while we were together and things would have turned out much differently. 

Princess Dinosaur, I wish that you will see this and realise that I really miss you so so so so much. I wish that you will see this and give me another chance to be a part of your life again.

It is true that Dean's list is little more than bragging rights. But for those who have never gotten it or aiming for multiple lists, the list is a goal and an affirmation of their effort / academic excellence. 

Anyway being on Dean's list is public information, having a high cap is not. Such a tattoo has its own pros and cons in group work in university. :P

From an interview perspective, Dean's list will add minimal incremental value to a FCH cap. However, during your employment and assuming you are an above average worker, Dean's list (similar to FCH, scholarship, valedictorian) might help to augment the image of you being an top performer among other above average peers."

Just a minor detail here, I think it is a bit strange to use the term tech bubble since technology has always been advancing. Consider the cavemen who used their primitive technology to hunt and start fires. Of course, unlike the cavemen, most of us wouldn't consider their stone tools to be technology in 2018. ""Technology"" itself is a moving target. Maybe you meant the IT industry as we know it reaching the end of its boom period. In that case, I also think that it is a matter of time. 
My opinion: Instead of a tech bubble, what I'm suspecting is an AI bubble. I think there has been genuine and fascinating advances in AI. However, it seems like the media is ignoring its limitations and overhyping it, and all the investors/people who read their clickbait articles join the buzzword hype/fearmongering. So it reminds me of the dot com bubble. But my understanding of AI is superficial, it would be great if any seniors in the AI specialization can share their thoughts on this.

- Should I buy now, or wait for IT fair, or buy on Amazon/another e-commerce website? 
- Should I go for an i5 or i7 processor? (Is the i7 processor worth its price, or should I just get a better i5 processor?). Should I go for dual or quad core?

3540,56480,"With due respect, all research prof are highly accredited in their research areas and how many times they have been cited in top notch journal. Partly, this is due to them obtaining their ""KPI"" in order to obtain tenure. Driven by how many papers the lab group have to published, most research prof doesn't take into account on how student learning can be improvised during lecture. Even though we are top in asia, the teaching method is just meh. 

Research prof doesn't take into account cognitive load of student and incorporating the various teaching strategies.

3542,56478,"To #56478:  Dean’s list is an award recognizing a top percentage of students in terms of their grades for a single semester. Depending on how well the cohort performs, the cut-off can go from 4.5 to 4.9+. In most cases it’s 4.7-4.8.

4.5-5.0* (First Class Hons), is a degree classification rather than an award. *It is also not uncommon to see dean’s list holders not having first class when graduating. I.e they can’t maintain getting average of >4.5 for other semesters or they started off badly.

Yes, Dean’s list is definitely a moral/ confidence booster. It’s a testament of  your academic excellence by being top* of your cohort. There’s even other tier’s of award such as book prizes (for the top student of each cohort). And the even more prestigious IES gold medal award for the top student upon graduation by CAP. The list goes on... 

Being invited to get the cert and some buffet event lets you network with other fellow dean’s listers as well. Also, there’s still a motivation for you to aim for SAP 5 to get dean’s list if you realized that a first/ second (upper) is no longer in an attainable range.

You can then tell your interviewers (probably you had some personal/ relationship issues) during the poorer performing semesters. Usng the dean’s list, you can still prove that you’re academically capable. "

3577,56416,"Been reading all the exam related stuff and whether to S/U or not...

Rule of thumb, if you wanna get highest honours, then you need 4.5 at least. So by right you should S/U anything A- and below. A- will bring you close to 4.5 but will not allow you to attain 4.5 minimally. 
If you are scared your employer will see your transcript, I doubt they will see the grade. They will look at the module you take, and you can always explain why you S/U-ed it and all. 

So guys and gals, don't get so worried about to S/U or not. In doubt, just S/U. :)"

@ Ck Fong
Appreciate your well-intentioned (?) advice, I agree with you on the cheatsheet part, but perhaps I should have provided clearer context in my efforts to protect my anonymity. AFAIK, there are only 2 modules with cheatsheets in the entity of the course. And those modules require more applied response so rigorous information would barely useful anyway. So what about the bulk of the other modules? Also, not everything is MCQ, and MCQs can be extremely tricky if they play with 1 or 2 words you have to specifically memorise to not get tricked. Not forgetting the exam conditions when time is tight and every option seems to be the correct answer. Yes, I agree with your second paragraph, but these questions are minimal and don't forget they still require memory work for concepts across different topics. As for your last statement, sorry to burst your bubble, but not everything can be ""studied smart"". Try memorising chemical structures, biological names, numbers that have no particular pattern all at once.

@ S P Ong
It's not as simple as that. Please don't misquote me, I didn't mention ""just memory work"". Memory work is far from ""just"" and is extremely intensive if it is expected for every single question. It also defeats the purpose of setting an applied question because whether you have a chance to approach that applied question is conditional on whether you first memorised that detail. Not really sure what you're driving at by bringing in your educator experience. Are you sure your class is not simply overwhelmed by the contents in your second mid-terms? (Open-book is one thing, being reasonable about it is another) This may be my own postulation, are you sure you didn't increase the amount of content because it is open-book? But from an educator's mouth, I am astonished by your condescending tone towards struggling students. ""Only losers whine about this kind of thing"". Wow okay, way to go, social justice warrior! I have a better advice for you, if you can't take ranting, don't follow NUSWhispers.

You never know, eyes everywhere. ;) Nevertheless thank you for your input, it made more meaningful sense without that tinge of condescension in the former. I largely agree with them, although I am still against the idea of using the stick approach on university students since we are expected to be independent adults.

Maybe I haven't clearly stated it, but I am not against the idea of cheatsheet examinations. I barely even have them! Or maybe I'm being unappreciative of the mere two cheatsheet exams I have, but welps.

I can function as a good project member, but I can't make friends. I have tried initiating conversation outside of project-related discussion, but that often tends to burn me. The conversation gets shut down, I get one-word replies, or I just straight-up get ignored. I would be the one asking all the questions, showing all the interest, etc, but it's never two-way. Maybe the words I choose are highly offputting and/or creepy? I'm not sure because no one has ever told me. 

I've joined three ccas, and attend events both on-campus and off-campus. For ccas, I end up treating it as a work environment where I just submit the required projects. I enjoy the ccas and the events regardless of my inability to make friends, but it would be nice to have some. 

Sometimes, it is because my hobbies don't align with the hobbies of people in the given social circle, like within a given cca. Other times, I just don't see what there is to share about. I might be playing a video game, or designing a poster, but see nothing to say about it. Even when I have something to share, like if I've read a good book and want to talk about it, most likely the other person hasn't read it. And they sure as hell aren't going to read a whole book just for me, lol.

I'm sure that it is certainly more to do with my flaws as a person, and less to do with others' ability to ""get"" me. To suggest that my hobbies are just too obscure for others to click with me, is pretentious and ultimately false. However, as for what flaws I actually hold as a person, I don't know and would love to know. Self-reflection is hard, yo.  

I also don't have a bf or gf, but that doesn't bother me as much. I hear about guys who straight-up confess to girls they've barely spoken to in the whole semester, stories about girls with like ten ex-boyfriends, etc, and all those stories blow my mind. How do such things even happen? "

We are inferior to chemical engineering people, chemistry majors and even business majors in the industry in terms of skills and everything.

This happens for a few reasons - first, 3K and 4K mods tend to have smaller classes and some of them don't even have a bell curve. Also, you are more likely to excel in a more 'nicher' specialisation or field that you really enjoy, which is what higher level modules cover.

I didn’t even know what I was doing in archi, other than the fact that my parents thought it was all so good and prestigious. The first half of the course I was struggling so hard. My cap was below 3.0, which couldn’t be helped because I keep getting C+ or C for our core mod of 8mc, (only got a B- once).

 By the way, have you sought help from the TA's and lecturers? Most of them are actually helpful and approachable if you’re willing to take the initiative to seek for their help. If you’re too shy to interrupt the class with your *low-level questions* (most likely they’re not), stay back after class/ walk-in for a consultation session with your lecturer/TA.

Of course, don’t expect them to spoon-feed you have the answers by not preparing for consultations. The BARE-MINIMUM is to copy down the tutorial/solutions and annotate what you don’t understand. After understanding, re-do the question to test your understanding.

BTW, are you from engineering? I will share with you what I did to survive.

Lectures:
-Print out hard copy beforehand, take a quick 5-minute glimpse of the contents so that you won’t go into the LT w/o knowing what’s going on.
-Most lecturers will speed through the contents, (you can’t really blame them as they have to finish the syllabus on time and cater the speed to the “majority”). Don’t feel despair if you can’t catch up with the pace. While there may be a handful of fast-learners in the LT, most students can’t fully absorb as well. 
-Just circle/annotate what you don’t understand. Don’t ask around your neighbors when lecturer is teaching. They may not be able to give a truly correct answer and it just irks everyone in the LT when there’s an ongoing commotion.
-At the end of the lecture, you can either “chiong” to be the first to ask your annotated questions/ wait for everyone to finish asking (they could be asking similar qns, so you can those off).

Tutorials:
-For Engineering, we usually have 5-7 tutorial questions. Unlike in JC where you can just “refer to lecture notes” for a similar example, NUS tutorial questions really requires you to crack your brains (at least for the first attempt). While some lecturers may disagree with this, I find it rather futile to waste over 1 hour thinking how to solve every single tutorial question.
-During tutorial, pay attention and jot down all the “solutions” from the white board. Heck if you don’t understand and cannot catch up, copy them down first! You can proceed to clarify your doubts at the end of the tutorial.
-Go home and redo the tutorial by yourself. Make sure you’re not blindly just copying your solutions to another piece of foolscap. Still unable to understand after redoing the tutorial? Go arrange a consultation session with your TA/ lecturer.
-Don’t procrastinate. If this is a week 3 tutorial, make sure you can redo the same tutorial by yourself (without aid) by the Saturday of week 3. If all else fails, return to the TA/lecturer again on week 4 ASAP. My point is, don’t accumulate your doubts. Trust me, the snowball effect is insane as you realize you can’t understand anything if your foundation is not built properly.

Labs:
-I’ve seen some students went to the extent of videoing the lab briefing haha. But IMO, it’s too tiring to waste my time “re-watching” a video tape. If you difficulties catching up/ understanding, I suggest that you can try “crashing” other lab sessions for a better understanding (Idk if this is still legal anymore). TBH, most GA/TA won’t even know if you’re crashing when you’re a “regular face” in their lab sessions.
-Max out all the lab participation marks by double checking your answers with the GAs.
Exams:
-Past year papers: Except for large cohort general modules such as MA1505 and MA1506, you’ll realize that most PYP don’t come with solutions. So I’d rather make sure a solid foundation is set via the tutorials first. Occasionally, the lecturers may release 1-2 recent papers with solutions. Focus on those and check with the lecturer if the older papers are still part of the syllabus.
I still find this advice by my JC teacher relevant for most NUS exams.
~50-60% of the questions: As long as you’re able to redo the tutorials by yourself, you should have no issues getting full marks (unless careless mistake).
~20% of the questions: Indirect questions, with more thinking and analysis, you should be able to do them (understanding the concepts).
~10-20%: Crazy questions (Tests you’re true mastery of the subject). Don’t be surprised if it is close to never mentioned before in the entire module. These questions are meant to differentiate between A/A+.
-So attaining at least a B/B- wouldn’t be too difficult if you can do 60% of the questions.

Friends:
Although I joined two orientation camps prior to year 1, the people whom i mixed with were not from camps  (Different tutorial groups etc.) Rather, through asking questions after class/ lecturer I’ve gotten to know few like-minded people. While NUS is known for its notorious cutthroat environment, there are still plenty of people who are willing to collaborate and help each other. Some may be weaker/stronger than you, but why not let's work together and score 100% for all our graded class assignments together? (Even the smartest students could make careless mistakes in graded homework btw). Of course, what’s better than being able to work in a group of like-minded hardworking people for your projects? 

Along your journey university you’ll encounters all sorts of people including, back-stabbers stealing other people’s code in lab, sabotage, buying senior’s code, all sorts of unethical stuff to survive in this competitive environment. But there’ll be no pride and reputation in those people’s work. Most likely they’re gonna be perpetuate with such corrupted mindset at work in future.

At the end of the day, you’re responsible for your own grades and learning. Whenever you’ve a setback, ask yourself “have I tried my best?” If yes, give yourself a pat on the back and continue sourcing for new solutions. That’s the point of university education right ? :)

Getting As or A+s are now becoming a taboo. You worked hard, 
got an A/A+, and when a friend asks you for your grade, you just reply ""Oh, I did well"" (hoping your friend doesn't pursue further, bcos you know he/she did worse than u, and you care for their feelings) 

You want to go out to celebrate getting good grades with your friends, but all your friends have a bad mood after receiving their results while you are on the opposite end of the spectrum. 

You consider for your friends, you guys don't celebrate.  You ask around and you realise it is just not you. Everyone hides their good grades, and only say their worst grades..

You go to another friend, ""Hey how did you do?"" 
Replies: ""Oh XX module i didn't do as well got a B-.""
""How about the other mods?""
Replies: ""Oh, I did better than expected!!"" (tries to hide)
""which is???""
Replies: ""Errr, A- and above?"" 

COME ON GUYSS: Why are you so ashamed of your A/A+??? Just say it! It does not show that you are proud af!
Instead, you should be proud of what you have done! If you are afraid that it will hurt your friends' feelings.... comeon, true friends will support and congratulate you for your hard work in doing well!! Friends that judge you/get salty after hearing your grades, do not really care for you.

Qn: I have worked so hard but I dont see results. 
Ans: Many have claimed to have worked hard and spent long hours during the sem. The first problem, it is relative. U think you have worked hard by your standards but the truth is u didnt, when compared to the others.  Or the second problem is your techique. Work hard but not smart. So do reflect on that. 

Lastly, it is never the end no matter what results (good or bad) you get. Truth is your class honour only determines where your career start line will be. There will be so many more opportunities and tripping stones out there after graduation. So dont be too fixated on results. Instead focus more on your attitude and work ethics which are more reliable factors to determine success in life "

I had teammates in my 4K module that scored a B or a B- in their foundation modules (1K stuff) but did really well in the project! This happens for a few reasons - first, 3K and 4K mods tend to have smaller classes and some of them don't even have a bell curve. Also, you are more likely to excel in a more 'nicher' specialisation or field that you really enjoy, which is what higher level modules cover.

I always thought that working long hours, staying up overnight to do my work meant that I was working hard. And I had the exact same thoughts as you. Everyone seems less stressed,  do less but scored well. I felt that it was unfair, but looking back and reflecting, I hated my work, hated archi, and it translate to my work being subpar.

I didn’t even know what I was doing in archi, other than the fact that my parents thought it was all so good and prestigious. The first half of the course I was struggling so hard. My cap was below 3.0, which couldn’t be helped because I keep getting C+ or C for our core mod of 8mc, (only got a B- once).

In the later half of the course, when we had time for UEs and the option to drop our core mod, I explored and found mods that I actually really enjoy studying. I didn’t even need long hours or overnighting to study because I really liked it. 

Thanks to that, I managed to pull up my cap from a pass to a third lower, and I was really really happy. You don’t need a first class to be happy, everyone has their own goals! You can only be happy if you stop comparing.

After going to summer school and taking UEs to explore my interest, I’m out of archi and doing something I actually like in a different industry. 

Don’t worry so much right now! There are a lot of people in similar situations. I had a cousin do a career switch in his 30s and there were also policies that can subsidise your learning in another field. WSQ or something. Keep pressing on! "

Looking at CORS, there are TWO photography mods offered next sem, NM3230 and NM4231. The article also mentions that at a focus group, students had complained about mods that “overlapped in content”. Perhaps the photography mod being deleted was one that overlapped with the existing photo mods that are already being taught? Do we really need 3 photo mods a sem?

As for there being concerns about there ‘not being enough mods to graduate’, I looked at the numbers on CORS. There are 40+ undergrad mods offered next sem. There are also 40+ mods offered by sociology and psychology. It’s a perfectly normal number. The fearmongering is unjustified.

I applied for scholarship but failed. Hence I work part-time to pay for my school fees, food and bills. I actually have earned enough to be able to pay for tuition and my own allowance for the next few years. 

However, there is a conflict of interest. My work and my study are at direct conflict with each other. The more time I spend on working, the less time I have on studying. The more time I spend on working, the more money I earn. Vice versa. 

I make about at least a dozen k or more a month when I put in effort. Hence it's close to impossible for me to give up working totally and become a 24/7 student. 

Last semester, I spent 80% of my free time working and the rest 20% on school work. During recess week, I would spend like 8 hours working and 2 hours studying. I couldn't concentrate on studying because I could have spent the hours making a few hundred /thousand bucks. The opportunity cost is too high. I got a CAP of low 4.1X, which is Distinction. Call me lucky because the modules I took last semester were mostly easy. Had I spent all my time studying, I have no slightest doubt that I would have gotten at least 4.6X CAP. 

I'm afraid that in the next few semesters, I might have to take more and tougher modules. If I continue to ""slack"" in my studies like that, my CAP might drop below 4.0 to Merit or worse. 

I'm studying an Arts degree. The prospect of fresh graduates from my course getting even a third of what I'm making is dull enough. 

I want to graduate with a good degree, I also want to graduate rich. Should I sacrifice grades for money or should I sacrifice money for grades? And how much should I sacrifice?

As for there being concerns about there ‘not being enough mods to graduate’, I looked at the numbers on CORS. There are 40+ undergrad mods offered next sem. There are also 40+ mods offered by sociology and psychology. It’s a perfectly normal number. The fearmongering is unjustified.

Overall, I find it amazing that this type of sensationalist, one-sided article was the top story on Today. Many of the same people who complain about the mainstream media seem to be all too happy to gobble this story up though!

Dear sir/mdm,

I would like to give suggestion here regarding on giving students an option for the best grading system of their choice for every single module in the tertiary education. This way, they can get to choose the best option that matchup with their strengths so to pass all modules, without people keeps criticizing the education system of being unfair, tough, outdated, all about grades and expecting one size fits all. In fact, tertiary education shouldn’t test us with written exams any more as it is more of hands on and work related. Module review/diary/reflections will be a small section of the module that is about essay writing, this will ask us to write out our thoughts about the module. How to improve the module? what we learnt? What can we improve with the knowledge that we learnt?

•Exam based: exam 70%, attendance 10%, class participation 10% and module review/diary/reflections 10%.

•Attachment based: attachment 70%, attendance 10%, class participation 10% and module review/diary/reflections 10%.

Depends on what ""biz"" mean to you or what you want to get out of the business modules. Every module (regardless of the fluffiness) would allow you to have some appreciation of a specific aspect of a business itself. Just need to know that taking biz modules won't turn you into a guru in that subject matter, but merely offer you a flavour of it. 

-if you want to get an overview of biz flow, you will need to make sure you are covered in financing/operations/sales. Some general operation mgmt/mkting modules will be good. AIS/MIS to understand flow of accounting information from front to back end. Corporate finance and international financial mkts modules to get exposure to why/how capital structure and financing options could matter.

-If you have a more specific angle such as budget/operational/financial assessment in running a company, you can tweak some of your modules selection. Switch AIS to mgmt accounting, and see which operation/mkting modules are more relevant.

-if you watch too much wolf of wall street and want to pursue investments related stuff, you can whack a series of finance modules. Accounting modules such as financial accounting, valuation and etc would be helpful for looking at financial statements for equities/credit investments

Have fun. Can't offer examples on non accounting/finance modules since I watch too much margin call.

I made the mistake of telling him (after he asked) that my ex and I had a very active sex life, about once a week, and he completely flipped out, demanding to know when and where and all sorts of things, asking me how good it was and all that.

I'm not sure how to respond to this, on one hand he's asking, and will likely think I'm hiding something if I don't answer, but on the other hand clearly he's not taking this very well?

He seems fine about my previous exes since the sexual activity wasn't that much, maybe about once a month, but completely flips out over this most recent one though it's been about a couple of years back and I honestly cannot remember much.

For context, he's asking about details like number of orgasms, positions and places, and like number of times we had unprotected sex... and I think he even asked about total number of times we had sex? I mean it's about once a week, you did ask, why you flipping out? And like do you really expect me to remember this? Number of times we had unprotected sex well I understand perhaps it's a concern, but I did get tested and I do insist on protection with him, so I don't see the issue; is he just jealous I insist on protection with him?

And it's not like he's a virgin incel or whatever, we do have sex too, just probably not as often since he's not exactly skilled at it. If anything I should be the one who's concerned, since he's been slightly dodgy on his relationship past.

3734,56175,"To #56166, if you are already a year 3 student and still ""not really learning much about the medical field"" makes me think that you are not paying attention in class (or maybe skipping lectures). Granted maybe your syllabus is different from your senior batches, you should still have had plenty of opportunities by now to source for internships at institutions, retail chains or even pharma companies to learn more about the medical field yourself during the holidays (for SOUL program if that is still a thing or just for personal enrichnent) or sharings by alumni organised by NUSPS instead of waiting for the dept to spoonfeed you information. There is a lot more to being a pharmacist in any types of settings than ""really boring"" or ""just a salesperson"", tbh its really disappointing to know that a pharm student thinks this way after all that publicity done to show the public what pharmacists can do other than dispensing.

On your concerns of pharm students having a bleak future, there are also many other things you can do with a pharm degree. If you do not have a passion in caring for and serving patients, you can always jump into industry or regulatory jobs (take a PECT internship in year 4). Or maybe you like the science but not so much interacting with patients or patient care, you can go for research, do a phd after you graduate. Skip pre-reg if you do not intend to do any jobs that requires a license. Or if you like medicine so much just go overseas for a medical degree. If you don't have passion for caring for or serving people (not just patients but their caregivers as well), personally I wouldn't recommend going into patient care jobs.

I enjoy programming and CS - I think of programming as a puzzle game with specific rules, and I think using technology to solve real world problems is meaningful. 

However, I do not wish to have a job where the only thing I do is code, for 2 reasons. Firstly, I think it would be too excessive. Just as we should not play too much games, I think I should not be programming excessively (eg for health, eyesight, relationship reasons). 

Secondly, from my understanding, programming is not the only skill needed to work in technology. If I only work on programming skills, I will probably end up with a short-lived career. Tech companies seem to prefer younger programmers and Software Engineers for their learning ability. When I am older and perhaps unable to learn as quickly as I can now, I would like to still have relevant and useful skills to contribute. 

I am aware that programming is simply a tool, and programming != CS. But I have heard that most CS graduates become Software Engineers, a job that entails spending most of one’s time coding (pls correct me if I am mistaken). 

So I wish to ask: 
1. How do Software Engineers avoid the aforementioned problems?

3755,56130,"Regarding the recent saga on fwb, I want to address 2 points. Point 1: Why it’s not advised for girls to have fwb? Point 2: Why men are not held up to the same standard?

I’m not gonna talk about human constructs like morality, religion or sociology. Instead I’ll address the issue through science, more specifically evolutionary biology, psychology and physiology (I’m a life science undergrad btw). 

Based on evolutionary biology and psychology, males are hard wired via natural selection to engage in casual sex because they can greatly increase their reproductive success and number of offspring, thus increasing his evolutionary fitness. Thus, this “promiscuous or polygamous” gene is passed on from generations to generations and is hard wired in male. Take a look at the animal kingdom, majority of the mammalian mating system (which humans are part of) is polygamy. Basically, relationship is fleeting, ie. touch and go, seed as many female as possible to maximize reproduction fitness. That’s why it’s not surprising to see players use terms like “I conquered x number of girls” or disappear into thin air after sex (hence the phrase “fk and go”). Furthermore, males are wired to be put off by female right after they orgasm (during sexual refractory period). This is to prevent repeated pointless seeding and to conserve energy and nutrient (aka. sperm and cum). That’s why guys are generally disinterested in girls after fwb sex. Lastly, it is in the interest of the male if he has sex with different female because it will enhance genetic diversity. Hence, males is easier to get bored with repeated sex with a same female. 

For mammalian female, they benefit more from being choosy due to the demands of gestation, breastfeeding and duty to nurture offspring. They maximize their reproduction fitness by being heavily invested emotionally to the male in order to seek security and protection during vulnerable periods like gestation. That’s why you see girls becoming clingy and emotionally attached after sex. Also, being choosy turns guy on because they are wired to thrive in competition and fight to mate with female. Female who have sex easily with guys are not choosy. As a result, words like “cheap”, “slut” and “easy to get” emerged and are used to tag these women, and only women but not men. 

Although the invention of contraception eliminated risk of childbearing, the human genes and innate instincts (shaped by thousands of years of evolution) don’t understand about modern contraception. The subconscious male and female brain still associate sex with reproduction and the series of psychology and emotion described above still gets triggered automatically during sex. 

Even if the girl so happen to have gained a rare spontaneous loss of function mutation in your gene and all the above physiology and psychology don’t apply to you, remember that your fwb most likely will still have these hard wired instincts. 

Basically, male and female have fundamental differences biologically. Comparing the 2 sexes is like comparing apple to orange (or should i say banana to abalone). It is simplistic to fight blindly for equality without addressing these intrinsic differences. 

I’m not condemning girls having fwb. I just hope to share my information so that girls can weigh the benefit and cost. Girls having fwb is taboo for a reason, and I don’t think it’s purely because of social reasons such as female oppression, religion or ancient conservative culture. "

3765,56118,"Maybe let me offer a different view on sexual exclusivity? Graduated from NUS, married with kids and now doing okay in the financial industry to be given a corner office in the financial district.

You people may be too hung up about sexual exclusivity in a relationship. Yes it is good to monogamous after marriage, but have seen way too many examples to know that sexual exclusivity is not a necessity for a happy marriage, or relationship. For all the romantics, affairs are way more common than you think. Try throwing a rock in the mbfc area and you are more likely than not to hit someone who slept with someone outside a relationship. The anxiety and anguish over loss of sexual exclusivity is what causes people to hide affairs in the first place.

I used to be a romantic for monogamy too, until my husband confessed that he was sleeping with a colleague. At first I felt angry and divorce was on my mind. Then after a night of cool down, I was not going to dismantle my family because he stuck his dick in another female's hole. He was and is still a loving husband and father. 

For the sake of the kids, I told him no divorce if I could have my own fwbs too. Funny how when the tables are turned, males start reconsidering their actions. He agreed though, and the kids were none the wiser. In my industry, well-dressed, good-looking people working long hours together are conducive grounds for finding fwbs, and it was not difficult for me to find my own (two is all I can handle).

Of course, there are ground rules, like protection to be worn at all times, to let each other know before liaisons with the fwbs, no getting pregnant or impregnating an fwb, and that family time is of paramount priority. I also go for and get my fwbs to go for regular health screenings. You are wrong if you think the sex is very frequent because we all lead busy lives. It's more like a catch up lunch, then followed by some private time together.

Some will judge me for this, and I don't care. My value as a female, mother and employee does not decrease because of the number of dicks I explored. Similarly, my husband's value as a male and father does not increase because of the number of females he stuck his dick into. Perversely, maybe due to the male ego, my husband insists on a session with me after he knows I had a liaison with one of my fwbs. Letting go of our insistence on sexual exclusivity has returned the much-needed spark to our relationship which has honestly gone stale before this.

For the girl who slept with her colleague, you should be honest with your boyfriend. If he cannot accept sexual non-exclusivity while you crave it, then you guys are not suited for each other. Find someone who can accept this craving of yours and you will be much happier.

This ability to let go of insisting on sexual exclusivity is not for everyone, and many will have a hard time accepting it. But this is an option for those who are unsure of a way forward."
3766,56116,"Hey guys, need some advice here. I suspect my brother has serious anger management issues and it is really getting on my nerves. Every single time he play some mobile games on his phone, he will start banging things around the house and it is seriously annoying. Right now as I am typing this, he is at it again. I have been ignoring his antics as I am sure a confrontation could potentially turn physical.

I saw a completely different side of him and frankly speaking, it was quite scary. However, it seems like the more I ignore him, the more overboard he gets. He is now at it every single day. I think the reason why he became like this was due to poor parenting on the part of my mum who have always been giving in and tolerating his shit behaviour since young.

3774,56098,"I don't get what's this thing about expecting relationships to not be about sex. Or this idea that seems to be permeating, that not having sex before marriage is better - that it results in better/more fulfilling relationships.

I mean it's true that your relationship would be reduced to being cheap and shallow if all it were about was sex. It's reasonable to say that your relationship should be about some kind of healthy balance between social, mental desire, as well as sexual desire. I mean, if you were sexually repulsed (or unattracted) to your partner in the first place, that's a recipe for failure right there (unless both you and your partner are fundamentally asexual, and you are both sexually unattracted to ANYONE).

All relationships that last long enough to become marriages either fall into the category of both individuals being asexual, or both individuals being at least slightly sexually attracted to each other. It would be ridiculous to anyone to want to date and/or marry someone they're not sexually attracted to. It would also be ridiculous to anyone, if it were made clearly obvious, to want to date and/or marry someone they were sexually attracted to, but who was not sexually attracted to them.

In the end, most people who marry or get into a relationship want sex(with sole exception of couples who BOTH don't want sex). They may be okay with waiting, they may want to abstain, but it would be unreasonable to think that sex is an optional part of the relationship. More importantly, it would be ridiculous to think that they might possibly be okay with never having sex."

The colleague messaged me after seeing my post to apologise for making me feel cheap. I waved it off and said it was in the past. We met up on Saturday for a meal for some innocent catchup.

During the meal, he mentioned he is now divorced after catching his ex-wife with another guy on their marital bed. Oh the irony, because we had copulated many times on that very same bed when his ex-wife was working.

After the meal, he invited me to his house for drinks. I accepted. Long story short, after many glasses of fine wine, we reconnected physically. Memories of our illicit past flowed back. Then, he was the cheater. Now, I am the cheater.

I felt guilt-wrecked after leaving his house as I made a no-sex before marriage pledge with my boyfriend. Not only have I broken that pledge, it was with the same colleague.

3791,56070,"Chiming in on the whole thing about fwb/sex before marriage. 

Personally i'm someone who's had sex with a handful of girls (all my exes). The sex was great and all, but I have to agree with #55982 that a lot of the gratification is short-lived. Even right after the sex, there's the usual post-coital tristesse. The 'reward' is mostly confined to before and during intercourse. 

Having tasted the joys (if you will) of sex and also now the fulfillment of being in an abstinent long-term relationship, I actually regret not staying a virgin till after marriage. I've never encountered anyone who deems lack of sexual experience as a dealbreaker. At worst, it's seen as an inconvenience to the more experienced partner. On the other hand, I can totally see why a person who's a virgin will feel bothered by someone who's had sexual history. My current girlfriend of 3 years is rather conservative and although she's kinky in private, often times going off on that tangent, she's clear about wanting to remain a virgin till after marriage. She initially thought I was a virgin as well. I wanted to be totally honest with her so I spilled the beans as soon as I mustered the courage. Knowing that we both liked each other already by then, it pained me to watch her deal with the shock of that information. She accepted me in the end, but I know she's still slightly bothered by it. It simply would've been better if I were a virgin as well.

Based off me and my peers' experience, i'd say that having a sexual history reduces one's eligible dating pool (with virgins). I also find that girls who are more 'traditional', 'backward', '1800s' w/e have more desirable qualities that guys would seek in someone they intend to marry and settle down with. Most likely the reverse is true as well--with voluntary virgins, that is; not too sure about bitter incels lol. 

Power to those who want to bang everything that moves; it's a personal choice after all. But if the intention is to one day settle down in a long-term monogamous relationship with a view to marriage and kids, then I think the odds of finding and retaining a suitable partner for that goal would be higher if one refrains from pre-marital sex. In the meantime, just grab your dick and double click.

3796,56060,"@#56030 I feel like there should be a caveat to the idea of ""just practice (sex) after marriage"". The OP of that post is probably assuming that everyone likes having intercourse in one specific way that everyone can agree on. Then yes, practice would improve the quality of your experience with someone. 

But sexual preferences can get pretty specific (I mean, just look at the vast offerings on the internet). Practice can't solve the issue of having preferences incompatible with your partner's, especially if the preferences are so different that you can't reach a compromise. Training doesn't work in this way, and you might only know your preferences after you try and explore. 

Therefore, for myself, I rather first figure out myself and what I need, instead of straight-up marrying someone, realizing we are too different in bed, and having to divorce.

Of course, there are couples who can endure despite sexual incompatibilities, but it is a key issue. 

And of course, if you are opposed to premarital sex, everyone should still respect and accept your decision. I'm just saying that it runs the risk of sexual incompatibilities, because you yourself may not know exactly what you need and like, until you try it. But of course, that risk is completely yours to take, and no one should say otherwise.

Hello #55982, thank you for your insight. I am a guy and I feel ashamed of myself for having fwb too. However, there are times where I am unable to control myself and indulge in lust. I agree that girls with fwb and casual sex are not morally right. This applies to guys as well and I feel ashamed because I have constantly been in 2 fwb relationship for 16 years since secondary school.  I do not deem myself as good-looking or fit. 

When I met my ex-girlfriend and be honest with her, I told her that I have been with 2 fwb for past 13 years. We have a hard start in relationship and gladly she was understanding and forgave me. However, we still break up in the end because of character mis-match. Truly enough, the whole aim in relationship is not about considering one past or not but is to be able to live with one another, to tolerate each other nonsense and even silence between each other feels good, because being together is to enjoy each other presence. Sometimes, when I look back, why do we even bother wasting time having a bad start when ultimately we still broke up due to character mis-match and not because of my fwb. So to all those couple having a similar start as me, it does not really matter you had fwb or multiple partners. Most importantly is whether you are able to live with that person comfortably or not! 

Back to the topic, after reading your post #55982 and #56043, I feel so immorally wrong every time I am with my fwb. I am a guy and I have my needs. Sometimes, we even went to 3P. To #55982, I need your advice greatly. I do not mind disclosing the identities of fwb because I think you have it too. The 2 fwb I have are my right hand and my left hand. I am sure you have it too.

Hello fellow fwb hater. I see you are a person who is trying to help others by showing them what is good and what is bad. That is very admirable.

1. To clarify, in your most recent post, I cannot be sure if you are not from the 1800s, because I see time travel as very possible, probably as much as you see fwb as being morally bad. But you are correct, what does it matter if you are from the 1800s or not?

2. You answered that it is your ethics and morality that puts you on a high horse to teach others. That is also agreeable, since a science teacher has a ""right"" to teach science, and so virtuous person such as yourself has the right to teach virtue. I would like to point out however, that to think yourself as better than most people you have not met is a vice in itself, and you should be cautious not to be led astray. Please remain within the sex-field where you are an expert in.

3. There are many virtue ethics theory, and I am not too sure which you are using. You clearly have avoided piety despite it being one of the ""original"" 5 virtues but I do think piety is very important to us and possibly your argument. You may want to reconsider bringing piety back into your life to become a more virtuous person. Also, fwb would not really be a violation of temperance (it is the uncontrolled act that makes it a violation, not the actual status of it itself). I believe you would agree with me and say that fwb is morally wrong (even if you only do it once or twice), in which case may I propose that it is a violation of piety and wisdom? I don't think I need to elaborate further because it's really obvious (you may see below for what I mean by this phrase). Furthermore, ""going down this philosophical circus of asking why"" was one of the ways we eventually got to virtue ethics. So please do not overlook the method. 

I would like to ask why guys are not upheld to the same standard. ""It's really obvious"" is a very poor argument. See I could argue that the position of my remote control need not be said to every visitor to my house, because it is really obvious (IT REALLY IS!), but that tells another person nothing about where the remote control really is (it's in a basket filled with other remote controls in the centre of the living room). 

All in all, feel free to express your belief that fwb and having multiple sex partners is morally wrong. We gotta do what's best for us moral people.

3804,56048,"The girls who post comments repeatedly about the double standards of male vs female sexuality are incredibly naive. Either that or they’re counting on the ignorance of the general public to do logical deduction.

It’s very simple. The reason why there is shame associated with female sexuality is because women are the deciders of sex. The “my body my right” argument holds here. Yes, it’s your body, yes it’s your right hence women should be accountable for their decision to have sex, whether this be with a single partner or multiple partners. And a reckless decision to sleep with many doesn’t grant you a medal... it just makes you look cheap and easy in the eyes of many. Forget the white knights who comment. They typically are hypocrites or have low standards because they’re low quality mates. No “alpha” I.e top quality male I know (and I know MANY) with TOP careers would ever date/marry a slut.

3807,56043,"Let’s admit it! We are unable to escape lust !

Hello #55982, thank you for your insight. I am a guy and I feel ashamed of myself for having fwb too. However, there are times where I am unable to control myself and indulge in lust. I agree that girls with fwb and casual sex are not morally right. This applies to guys as well and I feel ashamed because I have constantly been in 2 fwb relationship for 16 years since secondary school.  I do not deem myself as good-looking or fit. 

When I met my ex-girlfriend and be honest with her, I told her that I have been with 2 fwb for past 13 years. We have a hard start in relationship and gladly she was understanding and forgave me. However, we still break up in the end because of character mis-match. Truly enough, the whole aim in relationship is not about considering one past or not but is to be able to live with one another, to tolerate each other nonsense and even silence between each other feels good, because being together is to enjoy each other presence. Sometimes, when I look back, why do we even bother wasting time having a bad start when ultimately we still broke up due to character mis-match and not because of my fwb. So to all those couple having a similar start as me, it does not really matter you had fwb or multiple partners. Most importantly is whether you are able to live with that person comfortably or not! 

Back to the topic, after reading your post #55982 and #56043, I feel so immorally wrong every time I am with my fwb. I am a guy and I have my needs. Sometimes, we even went to 3P. To #55982, I need your advice greatly. I do not mind disclosing the identities of fwb because I think you have it too. The 2 fwb I have are my right hand and my left hand. I am sure you have it too. I am confused…For the sake of humanity, can you please educate me on this? From your 2 posts, I think your moral values and ethical beliefs did not allow you to indulge in such act too!"
3808,56041,"My take on the bell curve (and life in general ) is this. Its always good to be help and share with others around u like your friends etc. Sure one might be selfish and think that  helping someone else will make him better than u resulting in the other person pushing up the bellcurve. But in helping others u are helping yourself back as well and the person might return the favor to u. Sure the person might push up the best curve but even assuming that secaniro, what difference can one or two person make to the bell curve. The likely benfits that u receive in return will far outweigh the neligible increase in bellcurve the other peroson might cause.

3809,56038,"When I was a student, I thought I was lazy or undisciplined for sleeping late and feeling sleepy during the day. However after graduating and trying my best consciously to adhere to a hygienic sleep routine, I now know with more certainly that I have a delayed phase circadian rhythm. This means that no matter what place in the world I am in, my hormones will always synchronise my sleep cycle later than usual. Hence I am not wilfully a night person, but my bodily urges make me so. 

My eyes are dry in the morning and I cannot recall my schedule and have no drive or initiative. However my best hours are after 6pm when I'm really fast and accurate with thinking. Sleeping at 4am is considered on time for me. Why don't we schedule a high stakes interview/meeting at 3am? I would surely do well.

I could adhere to a normal sleep schedule, but my best hours are at midnight, when nobody goes to work. I then have to be in a vulnerable position during the day when deals are made and closed because I'm not at my best :(

3811,56030,"@#56030 I feel like there should be a caveat to the idea of ""just practice (sex) after marriage"". The OP of that post is probably assuming that everyone likes having intercourse in one specific way that everyone can agree on. Then yes, practice would improve the quality of your experience with someone. 

But sexual preferences can get pretty specific (I mean, just look at the vast offerings on the internet). Practice can't solve the issue of having preferences incompatible with your partner's, especially if the preferences are so different that you can't reach a compromise. Training doesn't work in this way, and you might only know your preferences after you try and explore. 

Therefore, for myself, I rather first figure out myself and what I need, instead of straight-up marrying someone, realizing we are too different in bed, and having to divorce.

Of course, there are couples who can endure despite sexual incompatibilities, but it is a key issue. 

And of course, if you are opposed to premarital sex, everyone should still respect and accept your decision. I'm just saying that it runs the risk of sexual incompatibilities, because you yourself may not know exactly what you need and like, until you try it. But of course, that risk is completely yours to take, and no one should say otherwise.

3823,56003,"Girl from #55930 here. Sorry #56003, I am not your honeybee as I didn’t go staycay with my boyfriend over the weekend. Something more complicated happened.

The colleague messaged me after seeing my post to apologise for making me feel cheap. I waved it off and said it was in the past. We met up on Saturday for a meal for some innocent catchup.

During the meal, he mentioned he is now divorced after catching his ex-wife with another guy on their marital bed. Oh the irony, because we had copulated many times on that very same bed when his ex-wife was working.

After the meal, he invited me to his house for drinks. I accepted. Long story short, after many glasses of fine wine, we reconnected physically. Memories of our illicit past flowed back. Then, he was the cheater. Now, I am the cheater.

I felt guilt-wrecked after leaving his house as I made a no-sex before marriage pledge with my boyfriend. Not only have I broken that pledge, it was with the same colleague. 

That colleague has now proposed being fwbs again (he knows I am attached). 

I am conflicted. On one hand, I love my boyfriend a lot and don’t mind marrying him even though the colleague is richer, has a better body,  better looking and sexually in-sync with me. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to seem wanton by going against my no-sex pledge with my boyfriend so early (he is quite conservative) even though I have my needs. 

Should I just fwb with the colleague while technically upholding the pledge by abstaining from sex with my boyfriend? Why does life have to be so complicated?"

It's just not for me to annouce to them that he is gay and tell them about how he confessed his love for me, how I explained that I'm straight and how when I started dating someone he simply decided to break off our friendship completely. I can't imagine how awkward it would be to see him again even with our mutual friends around. Albeit wanting to join for gatherings, I can't bring myself to join knowing that we're gonna be in each others' presence and how much old feelings it could possibly evoke again.

3837,55982,"I’m the poster of #55982 and #55063 condemning girls having fwb. I’m disappointed with the comments yet again (albeit some are reasonable points and I’m addressing them below). Please don’t comment if you don’t have a point to make and all you do is name calling and giving sinister remarks (eg. One post just comment “TLDR”. Seriously? What an useful comment, trying to attract attention?) I’m here to advise girls on self love, moral value and chastity. There’s an urgent need to fix our tattered moral fabrics. 

Sorry I’m gonna ignore all the useless comments and address a few key issues that surfaced:

1. Stop mentioning about causing harm! John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism and principle of harm is an absurd moral framework don’t you see it? Let me enlighten you: eg. Let’s say cheating with another man when you are married is morally wrong (if you don’t even agree with this, then you are really morally incorrigible). However, what if you are so good at cheating such that your husband can never find out? According to your harm principle logic, the act will miraculously become moral because there will only be harm if you get found out (eg. Husband feel hurt, parents feel disappointed etc). Basically, it is echoing “you can cheat as long as you don’t get caught”. It’s so superficial and absurd. Furthermore, I’m not even using utilitarian framework, why do you insist that you only ascribe to utilitarianism and ask me for harm mechanism?

2. Consequentialism is also a ridiculous framework (for goodness sake, please wiki on it if you don’t know prior to commenting, if not you will just look shallow). Why? For example, you are married and has sex with another man because he drugged you. If based on consequentialism, you are no different from a cheater because the final outcome is that you had sex with another man when you are married. It’s so absurd!! The framework failed to account for intention, ie. Good intention that lead to bad (due to bad luck etc) outcome will be deemed bad. 

3. Postmodern ethic is even more absurd. It adopts moral relativism and everything depends on context and culture. At its bare foundation, it’s basically power, linguistic game intertwined with cowardice to take a stand on moral issues. Basically, everything become subjective and opinion. Seriously? 

Some people may not grasp what I mean, I’ll elaborate a bit more clearly. Tom like strawberry ice cream and Daniel like chocolate ice cream. These are called OPINION and PREFERENCES. Postmodern ethic is basically attempting to change all rights and wrongs into subjective opinion and preferences just like how Tom can’t say Daniel is right or wrong to like chocolate ice cream (eg. Fwb is personal preference. It’s subjective whether casual sex is wrong.) Whether extramarital affair and incest is right or wrong will also become merely preference and subjective opinion. 

Can you imagine how dangerous and chaotic the world will become if everything is subjective? There will be no objective right or wrong or truth. Everybody can disagree on everything and nobody will be right or wrong because there’s no judge or benchmark. Is that what you want when you encourage people not to be judgy? Refusal to stand up against wrong vices such as fwb, and sugarcoat it into personal preference and opinion so that you won’t offend anyone is a classic example of cowardance. The society is getting too fixated on criticising judgy behavior to the point that principles and values are eroding. 

Do you all see the problem? Morality cannot be subjective and change based on context, time, or culture. If you think it will, then you have not truly grasp what morality is because you are merely talking about social norm and socially acceptability. Morality is so different from social norm for goodness sake. 

So what’s the fundamental philosophical issue here? Ans: there needs to be some form of moral GROUNDING and anchor in order to have objectivity. Virtue ethic is the grounding and anchor for human flourishing. Some comments questioned why virtue ethic is the best? Why these virtue and not others etc.. The key is: you cannot question why!! Why not? Ans: because it is the fundamental axiom. What is an axiom? Axiom is an irreducible primary. It doesn't rest upon anything in order to be valid, and it cannot be proven by any ""more basic"" premises. 

We need axiom because if not, we will run into the infinite regress problem. Eg. What is human made of - cell. What is cell made of - atoms. What is atoms made of - proton, neutron and electrons. What is proton made of - quark. What is quark made of - dark matter. What is dark matter made of? Do you see the problem? You can ask “what” infinitely and it will never end. That means there must be some irreducible primary that cannot be questioned even further and that is axiom. 

Examples of axiom are: Parallel lines can never meet. Probability can only range from 0-1. Do you question them? You don’t!! Because they are self evident and are irreducible primary!! It will be insane if you say to your math teacher these are dogma!! 

Virtue is similar to “parallel lines dont intersect and probability range from 0-1”. It is an irreducible primary axiom of moral philosophy that is self evident and cannot be questioned, but it is NOT a dogma. You cannot question the cardinal virtues because they are inherent good, ie. the essence is good and you can’t doubt that the essence of virtue is bad. You can resort to intellectual dishonesty or play verbal games by twisting virtue into bad things (eg. coining terms such as “fwb virtue” or “wisdom of murder”), that will just make you look childish. 

All right... this is not a philosophy classroom and I don’t want to bombard layman with things they can’t grasp, it will just bore them out. 

I just wanna say, I am currently attached for 2 years and neither me nor my gf have any tainted fwb history (hence I’m certainly not an incel nor some desperate horny guy). In fact, I broke up with a girl before she wanna have sex with me before marriage. 

I’m amused that a lot people are annoyed by my superior and holier-than-thou attitude. Because you know what? I don’t even see myself as superior or holier. I’m just a normal person. The fact that you feel I’m holier is because your reference point of “moral normality” is so low such that you feel I’m holier. 

Girls... please stop lowering the moral benchmark even more. If not, nude women walking on street might be the new “morality” in future. Don’t be used by men, please! "

3841,55978,"#55943 I'm graduating this sem. 3+ years ago, I made the decision not to go for orientation camp. Some facts:

1. I don't have cliques of friends that take classes with me. In most classes, I only recognise a few students.
2. I'm still single if that is a concern. But that would not have changed much as a CS student.
3. You can still study well without friends. If you are stuck with problems, you can ask the person beside you or just approach the professor.

To put things into perspective, even if you do go for orientation camp and know some acquaintances and probably 3-4 friends that actually stick around, it is highly inefficient to be planning the exact same classes with them all the time. Most students will be taking different classes anyway. And if you do attend same classes, you aren't supposed to be chatting away in most of the lecture.

I do not regret missing the orientation camp. Most of my interactions with people in NUS is genuine. Be it tanking group projects, asking professor's questions, or discussing actual problems/projects in my majors. These project mates could turn out to be acquaintances/friends down the road, and you will also have a better idea what kind of person he/she is. Will he/she run away during projects or is he/she a responsible person?

I would recommend focusing on personal growth in NUS instead. You will realise that friends come easily when you are good at what you do, and you will also not be as bothered by being alone anyway. "

3843,55976,"I recently found out the likely reason why NUS may not usually allow students to take leave of absence even if it is a well-grounded one. For instance, a student may want to take an internship in year 4 sem 1 and delay graduation for a sem. 
In such a situation, normally a university should grant the request, because why not? (Not to mention that NUS supports the spirit of entrepreneurship) But it appears that NUS will have to pay MOE the tuition grant that is provided by MOE to local students. Thus, whenever a student doesn't graduate on time, NUS will be losing money. (For instance, if you are a science student, the tuition fees amounts to 40000, but with tuition grant, you only pay 8000, that means the school pays back roughly 30000 to MOE, rounding up to first significance digit) Of course, in the best interest of the school, they will try their best to graduate all their students on time. 
This line of reasoning makes a lot of sense to me, so I believe it is true. Not to say that i heard the story from a rather credible source. But with the recent fake news saga, I must say, decide for yourself whether this is true or not. After all, I am just writing what I heard from others. 
This kind of things affects the interest of the students and should really be made known to us. At least it should be an open secret, if such things really exist. So is it an open secret? Do you know of real examples of students being rejected of Leave of Absence?

3850,55964,"To the girl thinking of telling her boyfriend about her fwb with a married man. My advice is simply: Do not tell him. Not telling him does not mean that you are lying. I expect to be flamed for this but in my personal opinion, you are not obliged to share anything about your past. You can choose what you want to share and how much. Plus you ended off well with your fwb so it is highly unlikely that your fwb will blackmail you and your boyfriend would not find out unless you told him yourself.

My rationale for this is he will not see you in the same way again. Even if he accepts your past, even if he himself says that he does not mind and it will not change anything. Trust me, it will. He will still judge your moral values subconsciously even if he says he will not. Perhaps he might even bring it up when you guys argue. Perhaps he might even use this reason to call you a slut or a whore if he happens to call you names during a fight. 

Don't bring it up. Don't focus about the past and focus more on the present and on your current relationship. Nothing good comes out from airing your dirty laundry even if it is towards a potential significant other."

3856,55954,"I am a chemical engineering Nus alumni, was reading the posts on the debate about the usefulness of a technical and non technical degree. A lot of valid points for the value of arts degrees. But I just want to ask a question, what do you hope to get out of a university education? I can only speak from my experience in engineering. I did not do well for my degree, just a pass degree. I also do not find the course contents relevant to engineering jobs that it supposed to train me for. Ultimately what differentiates you from other job applicants are the values you can provide to your employer, of course, it needs not be a technical degree. However have to admit studying a technical degree enables you to implement good ideas, and you cannot do without the execution part while generating good ideas are equally important.

Now I will divert into another topic, about how good is teaching in NUS, and whether NUS should focus on attracting research faculty to boost their rankings. Personally as a fee paying student I would go for teaching quality , and do not get me wrong, I am not advocating spoon-feeding but the ability of lecturers to impart their knowledge and expertise is important especially in the STEM fields. If they cannot impart knowledge and skills efficiently, then it defeats the purpose of paying for tuition fees, I might as well just Google for better teaching if not for the degree scroll.

In conclusion, I do understand the points both sides of the debates are coming from but the most important thing is what do you want to get out or got out of your university education? I do not regret taking up my course not because it is ""practical"" but because I developed through it a sense of self dependence, to persevere through problems on my own. I did not achieve honours but I am proud I completed the course without much ""extra resources"" in the form of passed down notes and solutions for past year papers."
3857,55951,"Every year, university rankings pop up but I don't pay much attention because I already know what the quality of education in NUS is like (you hone your research skills by searching for the good profs).

Seeing NUS top the charts in cleaners' welfare would catch my attention. Okay now I know that our cleaners are contracted - we outsource our cleaning to cut costs. But it's an NUS office that awards tenders and pays the contractors. And this tender system has a criteria of cost-effectiveness, quality, etc. If NUS really has that great a law school and business school, it can come up with a tendering system that values protection for cleaners while not bleeding our budget. Another thing we could look into is providing good rest spaces. Our cleaners have to climb the ridiculous number of stairs in NUS, and a lot are quite old. Mopping the floor after it rains is also strenuous because they have to avoid falling. It would be good if NUS could create proper rest spaces for them. If they have to sit in the stairwells, maybe get them some nice chairs and not the broken and mouldy ones from staff offices. 

I don't really care for academic rankings. It's not going to make me #proud of NUS. But if the news pops that NUS leads in best-practices when it comes to awarding cleaning contracts and caring for its cleaners, you bet I'm going to share how proud I am to come from NUS (and get started on that class giving thing, if this is what it takes for Management to care)

3858,55950,"Unsure where #55950 gets his confidence that #55930 is his girlfriend. On the other hand, I think #55930 is probably my girlfriend, especially after the events over the weekend.

We got attached quite recently. I also know that I am her third boyfriend. As new lovebirds in the honeymoon phase, we went for a two night staycation. Nothing out of the ordinary happened other than our first sex together (I wore protection). On the second night, things took a bizarre turn. She wanted to do the deed unprotected, but she said she needed to make a confession. A confession that she slept with a married colleague for about a year in the time between her last relationship and knowing me.

I felt crushed. And my libido went down faster than the sterling pound would on a no-deal Brexit.

She then confessed through tears that she started sleeping with him because they worked long hours together and the first night happened after some copious amounts of alcohol and persistent persuasion by him. After the first night, she continued sleeping with him because she felt an emotional connection to him, and that she felt lonely having exited a rather long relationship. She felt I should know that they had unprotected sex multiple times, even though both of them were clean as their workplace required regular HIV and blood screenings. She also further confessed that that was not her first time sleeping outside a relationship as she slept with one of her exes when they were not yet together.

I felt utterly crushed.

There was the newly found love of my life confessing her past deeds which I would have otherwise felt repulsive. Even though I am not a virgin myself, my past and only partner was my previous official girlfriend. I told her I needed some time to think and we turned in for the night on different sides of the bed.

I stayed awake, and she did too. It fell into place. She constantly mentioning her need for emotional connection when I first dated her. Her rather excellent bed skills that seem incongruent with her long spell of singlehood after her last relationship. She is frankly not the best looking girl around, but I can sort of understand why the married colleague continued returning to sleep with her, for she must have satisfied him where his partner didn't.

I still felt crushed, but the rational part of me knows that it was my ego (the number of past sexual partners) that felt crushed. 

What she did before knowing me is part of her history, and as a single at that time, she was not accountable to me. She said she stopped sleeping with him when she felt cheap and that she needed to enter into a more fulfilling relationship with someone who would spend his life together with her. She has since moved to a new workplace, and her health screenings since then have shown nothing wrong.

I felt crushed, but less crushed.

By taking a leap of faith to be fully candid with me, she hoped to put this behind her and move on properly without it being a guillotine over our relationship. As it is in the past before she knew me, the least I could do is to accept her for what she is now, and build our lives together as a new couple.

I reached out to her. She was still sobbing. I told I appreciated her honesty and want her to put all these behind her. Her sole emotional connection should be with me only, and vice versa. We made sweet love, before I cheekily asked her to serve me with her full repertoire of bed skills.

I felt crushed, but this time, it was feeling crushed by her libido. I regretted my cheeky request.

By the time the sun rose, she was snoozing away under the sheets in bliss. I stayed awake. This is merely the start of our journey. I may not like her history, but it is part of her that I will have to accept. What is more important is that we move forward together. To put it crudely, how many cave explorers she had, or whether I am the first cave explorer, is way less important than the fact that we are each other's last and only explorer from now on.

Honeybee, you may not know that I read NUSWhispers since I am not from NUS, but if #55930 is truly you, the above words are my true feelings.

Your nectar.

PS if #55930 is not my honeybee, oops. But honesty is still the best policy."

3864,55943,"#55943 I'm graduating this sem. 3+ years ago, I made the decision not to go for orientation camp. Some facts:

1. I don't have cliques of friends that take classes with me. In most classes, I only recognise a few students.
2. I'm still single if that is a concern. But that would not have changed much as a CS student.
3. You can still study well without friends. If you are stuck with problems, you can ask the person beside you or just approach the professor.

To put things into perspective, even if you do go for orientation camp and know some acquaintances and probably 3-4 friends that actually stick around, it is highly inefficient to be planning the exact same classes with them all the time. Most students will be taking different classes anyway. And if you do attend same classes, you aren't supposed to be chatting away in most of the lecture.

I do not regret missing the orientation camp. Most of my interactions with people in NUS is genuine. Be it tanking group projects, asking professor's questions, or discussing actual problems/projects in my majors. These project mates could turn out to be acquaintances/friends down the road, and you will also have a better idea what kind of person he/she is. Will he/she run away during projects or is he/she a responsible person?

I would recommend focusing on personal growth in NUS instead. You will realise that friends come easily when you are good at what you do, and you will also not be as bothered by being alone anyway. "

X and I are not very well acquainted at the moment (just able to talk about work related matters, but nothing personal), but I’m afraid of trying to get to know X better because I’m scared of what it might lead to.

In the recent episode, Harry was not successfully re-hired again from his Tze Char Boss, Dick. Over the next few days, he went on a mass application and submission of his resume. Sooner enough, he got a reply from a vendor cleaning company. He was readily happy to strike the interview as he knew that what he is applying to is truly related to his bachelor degree. During the interview, he try his best to express how passionate he is about dish-washing and how he is able to contribute to the company. Ultimately, he is given the offer. When asked about the figures for his salary, he went on to research on the current jobs' market rate. 

Job ------ Market Salary
Dish Washer : $XYZ
Chef :   $XYZ + $Xtra

He went back to the interview the next day.

Harry : ""Hi , I am very super passionate about my job and I love it very much. I am asking for a figure $XYZ + $Xtra.""
Interview : ""Sorry, We are happy that you are passionate about the job and happy to have you with us but we are conducting a business. We can only pay you by the market rate - $XYZ.""

Harry accepted the offer. The next day, the cleaning company sent him to work at Dick's loklok stall. How ironic it is to be to be back to his old boss stall ! During the smoking break, Tom chat with Harry.

Tom : ""Eh harry, how much are you getting now?""
Harry : ""Market rate , $XYZ lor. How about you ?""
Tom :  ""I also getting market rate lor. $XYZ + $Xtra. We all taking the market rate. See la, that time I told you to apply Cooking degree. You don't listen. Now every month take lesser $Xtra money! ""
Harry : ""I have the passion for dish washing and I am very good at washing dish (lvl 99). Too bad the market rate for my field is lower.""
Tom : ""Of course lower la, your course is not a technical course that the world recognize to be at a good market rate. ""
Harry : ""Hey, stop all your technical vs non-technical logic okie! I join dish washing course because of my own reason okie! Sometimes, your reason is so ""appalling"" that I wonder are you really a university student from the way you speak.""
Tom : ""Hey if you want to debate, let us reason it out amicably. You do not need to explicitly ""Try hard"" to insult me. That shows how easily offended you are. Later you ""Angry TioLaiXiong"" then you know...""

*Both remain silence*

Harry : ""Hey, I thought Dick already hire a fresh graduate to wash dish, how come he still hire a vendor to wash the dishes?""
Tom : ""Aiya, nowadays everywhere also cut cost. I am going to have a salary increment next year. I think Dick hire the fresh graduate to replace me soon. I have to upgrade my cooking skills consistently to show my worth in his loklok stall.""

(A year passed... )

Given the same amount of time spent for Tom & Harry living in his world, Tom have 12*$Xtra more money than Harry.

3875,55930,"Girl from #55930 here. Sorry #56003, I am not your honeybee as I didn’t go staycay with my boyfriend over the weekend. Something more complicated happened.

The colleague messaged me after seeing my post to apologise for making me feel cheap. I waved it off and said it was in the past. We met up on Saturday for a meal for some innocent catchup.

During the meal, he mentioned he is now divorced after catching his ex-wife with another guy on their marital bed. Oh the irony, because we had copulated many times on that very same bed when his ex-wife was working.

After the meal, he invited me to his house for drinks. I accepted. Long story short, after many glasses of fine wine, we reconnected physically. Memories of our illicit past flowed back. Then, he was the cheater. Now, I am the cheater.

I felt guilt-wrecked after leaving his house as I made a no-sex before marriage pledge with my boyfriend. Not only have I broken that pledge, it was with the same colleague. 

That colleague has now proposed being fwbs again (he knows I am attached). 

I am conflicted. On one hand, I love my boyfriend a lot and don’t mind marrying him even though the colleague is richer, has a better body,  better looking and sexually in-sync with me. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to seem wanton by going against my no-sex pledge with my boyfriend so early (he is quite conservative) even though I have my needs.

So stop comparing which degrees are useless, which aren't. The truth is, they're only useless if YOU waste them. Other people's opinion don't matter, why let them dictate to you whether you're in a ""lousy"" course or not? Who are THEY to decide? God?

3893,55901,"Hi all, I’m a medical student from YLLSOM (guess I’m too free that I have time to read this forum and make this post haha..) but anyways... I just want to make 1 point. And no, I’m not gonna involve involve myself into the FASS saga.. I’ll leave it to the public to decide whether med or fass is better :P

I’m more interested about doctors being replaced by AI and would like to give my 2 cent worth (probably helping some JC kids to pass med sch interview if they happen to read this post). With the advance of AI like MIT Watson, doctors seemed threatened to be replaced, or is it? It’s superficial to claim that doctor’s job is to cure patients (in fact it’s quite rare given the rise of chronic diseases). William Osler put it very nicely “to cure sometimes, to treat often and to comfort always”. The key role of doctor is to offer comfort, emphasize and give hope to patients. Scientists and drug researcher are the ones they truly cure diseases. 

Even with the rise of AI, the human touch and emotional connection will always be needed during times of vulnerability when one is sick. And doctors will never be replaced. 

Ok, back to mugging! Hope I helped some med wannabe.. YLLSOM is not hard to get in, you just need to throw out all the stereotype and superficiality and truly understand the profession. "

3897,55895,"Hi, I’ve been reading the interesting (although sometimes overly emotional) posts on NUSWhispers. Here are my thoughts: 
Generalist degrees (e.g FASS) teach a wide range of knowhow. The students may be less prepared for their first job compared to their peers, but they have better progression (late game). They should probably equip some technical skills (e.g excel, basic programming) to help with their early game. 
For Specialist degrees (e.g Comp Science), the students are well prepared for their first jobs (early game), but they will probably find themselves unemployed in 3 years IF they stop learning. They must keep the momentum going and keep learning new stuff. 
Regarding the survey showing that SUTD and SMU students have a higher mean starting salary compared to NUS students: 
Firstly, the subjects often have different names, but when we do a comparison between similar subjects (e.g SMU and NUS computer science), we can see that the NUS graduates generally fair better. Taking the mean across all subjects (including the ‘late game’ generalist degrees) naturally gives the result in the survey. 
Nevertheless, I think there is a lot that we can learn from SUTD and SMU. Considering their admission cutoffs together with their starting salaries, I think that there is a lot of value-adding from these Unis. 
In particular, I think the industry focused approach that they adopt is very beneficial. When a university is industry focused, the students can learn how to solve the current challenges faced by the industry. The university’s research will also  benefit by becoming more relevant.
What I often see in NUS is the CAP focused approach. Quite often, students internalize the content taught without learning about its practical use. And sometimes, content is taught without thinking about whether it has practical use. My suggestion is to couple the theoretical content taught in modules with their applications in industry. I see some profs and TAs from SOC in the comments sometimes, I am interested to see what you guys think too. (Sorry that my writing is not very rigorous. It’s because I am typing this at 3am.

3903,55888,"Let's admit it. - ""If you are the tze char boss, will you employ the chef or the dishwasher?""

This is a cruel world. Only the survivor of the fittest will gain. If you are in a stage of life to decide whether your career route will be technical or not, my advice is choose the technical route. Oh wait, I am using the word ""IF"", ""IF, ""IF. Please don't come and tell me that I am categorizing and having a conclusion that the world is black and white, all or nothing. It is a conditional clause and I'm not implying on any ""conclusive thoughts that you are referring to"". 

Yes, this is the world and the world is unfair. If you do not run fast enough, others will overtake you easily. If you do not choose a technical route, others will. For example, Tom graduate from a Bachelor of Cooking and Harry graduate from a Bachelor of Dish-washing. Both went to apply the job. Sadly, there is only 1 open vacancy. So the question is who will get hire in the end? 

During the interview...

Tom say : ""I can cook"". 
Harry say : ""I can wash the dish"".
Tom say : ""I can cook and wash the dish""

In the end, Tom get hire because he can do both. Let's say in times of good economy, the Tze char boss, Dick, is in a happy mood and hire both of them.  Harry, on the other hand, aware of his disadvantage position he is in and impress his Dick by being the most hardworking dish-washer in the stall. One day, the economy trend changes from Tze char to lok lok. Customers  drop and Dick need to cut workers. Who will be the first to go? Of course is harry even if he is the most hardworking person in the stall. Why will the most hardworking person force to leave? What logic is this? As I said, this is the world and the world does not pity you. Only technical prevails. In order for business to grow, Dick being a dick need the chef to sustain his business but not harry. If not who cook? you cook ah? Then who can wash the dish? Of course is Tom la... 

So what if Harry tries all his life to be the best he can do, being the best dish washer in the world? It does not work at all. It all goes deep down on whether you have the value and skills to the business or not and not to always dream at the optimistic side that ""Okie..keep cool, i will just be the best i can do and then something will drop from the sky and save me"". 

Eventually, Dick convert his Tze char to lok lok style, following the trend of the economy. Customers swarm his stall and business is on its peak again. He intended to hire 1 additional person to fill up Harry job again - Wash dish !!! One day, 5 graduates from Bachelor of Cooking comes to apply for this job. Thus, there is a surplus of available technical-skilled person to be able to fulfill this job. Then, harry heard the news and went to apply for this job again. Dick saw harry and did not hire him eventually but just pick out the best from the 5 graduates. Why harry did not get hire again even if he always try to be the best dishwasher in the world? Because Dick need someone to cover Tom if he is on MC or if one day Tom intend to leave the lok lok stall. 

Choosing a route for your career is important. Don't worry on passion first. Passion can be build at later stage. Even if no passion, it does not matter. At least you will not be stress about lack of money in future. Of course, earn it fast, earn it well and retire early. And remember to buy insurance early to protect your assets in future. 

People always tell me ""Aiya, you earn so much money, later one day you suddenly die how?"" Then, i will ask them back ""What if I have this mentally of you and just spent and be happy everyday and eventually i did not die suddenly how? Then i need to start to earn back all my money at an older age again?""

3906,55883,"To #55865: Guys usually overstate their number of previous sexual partners... just saying. But on the off chance that it's accurate - I mean you can tell in bed, honestly. Personally my ex and I broke up on personal differences, so I can't say I empathise much. But he's had a few previous partners as well... I'm pretty sure more than 8, and he was exceptionally good, which makes it all the more awkward when I bump into him at techno. Well here's to more years of bumping into him at E2 café...

But from a more serious perspective, I think maybe people should carefully weigh the pros and cons about breakup before actually considering it. Finding someone who gets you is not easy, and oftentimes even if they say there are plenty more fish in the sea, even when you catch another fish, you end up comparing it to the one that got away. And the one that got away will always be bigger because you're looking at it through rose tinted glasses.

So the saying should be there are plenty more fish in the sea, so don't stop till you catch a sea king. (Yes, I read One-Piece, don't judge, it's not only a guy thing). If your friend thinks that she's found the one, then this small issue isn't going to bother her that much. Maybe it's something else that's bothering her, and this sudden revelation has just made it worse.

Well all the best I guess, these things are always rather thorny to deal with. But mind you, getting dumped hurts like a bitch, so be careful about bringing it up."
3907,55882,"#55865 Hi, sorry, to be honest, your friend should ask herself if she's content with this guy. I don't see an issue with having multiple previous partners, especially since he's at least decent enough to not talk (read: brag) about them, and to be fair, your friend didn't ask.

I've seen people who can't shut up about their previous partners, whether they talk about bedroom antics or just generally stories about their exes to their current bf/gf, and I think that's just massively disrespectful unless they've clearly stated that they want to know. Disclaimer here, I've seen someone who's used the fact that a project acronym was the same 3 letters as the start of her ex bf's name to launch into a long rant about her ex, and I think that's completely unreasonable and totally selfish.

I think it's important for people generally to adopt a don't ask don't tell kind of situation, unless you're sure you can handle it, and unless there's really something important to raise like an STI or a previous pregnancy I guess. In this case clearly your friend can't handle it, and I'd advise her to go talk to him about it calmly, because there's no sense in ruining something that's good now over something that's fucked up in the past.

I guess I can see why she'd be concerned, probably thinking along the lines that she's not ""unique"" or that there's nothing ""special"" about this relationship to him rather than all the others, but I think at the end of the day, special is what you make it. The difference is simply that the rest are in the past, and one day they'll be forgotten. If he's serious about this one, why not?

Anyway, this is for them to decide. I can only advise them to talk about it, and honestly, if she's otherwise happy and this is something she thinks she can get over in the long run, why ruin it now?

I mean, good guys and good sex are hard to find, girl. Don't ruin it on a whim, and don't end it without talking about it first."

3911,55875,"Regarding the debacle over the sexual history of romantic partners here, I would like to point out that this may be the result of a hyper–sanitized and purist mindset over sex that had been encouraged and perhaps indoctrinated in us at youth. I do not blame my parents, as every parent would want to protect their child and their innocence. However, as an Asian that grew up in Europe, I have got to experience on one end, a more liberal, sex-positive society and on another end a more Asian, conservative one dominated by Abrahamic faiths (here).

What I would like to suggest is that by oversanitizing the topic of sex, giving it too strong a cringe-factor and associating it with disgust, virginity suddenly becomes an excessively important factor for relationships. This seems to be part of mainstream culture here and I accept that.

Whilst I applaud the pragmatism of our society, I believe that perhaps this puritanical ideation of love, sex and marriage could be a contributing factor to the declining birth rate. By over–sanitising sex in our culture, this prohibits an honest and reasonable intergenerational dialogue (for instance between parent and child, teacher and student) and also halts any form of sexual deviance and exploration. In so doing, we have successfully steered ourselves away from a society that can achieve reproductive success (healthy TFR).

What I suggest is that key stakeholders continue to expand the image of open–arms, open–ears positivity to the sex education system, not just the current areas already covered by the public health agenda (I see promise in the cheesy adverts on diabetes), as I believe this would benefit the youth of today and tomorrow."
3912,55874,"In response to post #55864 and really the whole debate going on about FASS...

I'm not a FASS student but I have to say it is naive to think that technical degrees like law, medicine, pharmacy, architecture are safe degrees in this day and age. There is a glut of lawyers out there in the market (this is not gonna clear out anytime soon) and with the rise of AI and other technologies, there will be even lesser need for lawyers in future. In medicine, doctors are generally in a good place but many professional medical jobs will also be replaced with robots and AI. Pharmacy, there won't be a need for pharmacist at the pharmacy, and for those working in hospitals or research, you career is rather stagnant without an advanced degree. Bankers are already losing jobs due to technology and market conditions, and this will only get worst in future. Architects are generally in a good place since you can't substitute creativity, but again not many architects make it to the top because there will always be those few people that stands out from the rest and you either move on to management roles or be stuck with the menial work at the bottom. 

The value of a degree is as much as the value of a person, what can you bring to the table that is different from everyone else? There are many lawyers, doctors, pharmacist, architects and etc that have moved on from their traditional professional roles,  why? They find better value/purpose elsewhere. The point I'm trying to say is this, every profession out there is at risk of being substituted or replaced by technology or market factors, how you'll survive is really dependent on your ability to learn and adapt to the work environment that you are put in. There are safer degrees but there are no safe jobs. And your wealth can come in many ways and not just from your profession, you'll just got to figure out what works best for you. A FASS grad will fill up roles that are necessary in the labor market, and they are vital for a country to function.

3914,55871,"With regards to the late class division talks. I have many messy ideas surrounding this issue. Let me just spam some random and unconsolidated thoughts I have about it. Legit not coherent points below.

In short, I believe both sides got some severe stereotype of the opposite ""class"". Hate on the advantages of the rich, 

1. I think fast runners should be left to run ahead. Don't slow the fast ones down to match the rest. Push the slower ones up to be closer to the fast ones. You cant expect everybody to have the same ability. Some are fast some are slow. I feel sad for the IP girl getting hate for expressing her opinion on it which is valid. There is no point lumping all the different students in the same class room,  so that all of them get ""equal"" education? Equal and fair is not always the same thing. And you think teaching a class of all differently paced students is that easy? The rich and stable families can afford many additional resources to help them run even faster. So it is 'unfair' to those that don't have access to these resources? Their parents earned that money to spend on their children, its up to them. The focus on how the 'rich' kids get the advantage shouldn't be hated upon. Yes this pushes the 'cleverer' students ahead creating the gap. The rich giving their own children advantage can never be avoided, I believe what we need to access should be split between the ""Basic(by School)"" and ""Additional(by Others)"" 

2. Express don't mix w NA and NT? When you go school, you are in that one same class with that same people like 90% of the time. Even within the class we have in general a few group mah, I not in your group doesn't mean I like you. I'm not interested in interacting with you doesn't mean I look down on you. I walk on the street and I don't make friends w every single person. When I get along with someone is usually because we have a common interest or goal. I dont check your salary before befriending you. After your first day you'll know perhaps 1 or 2 people you think can click one, from there find a few more people that can click, you form a clique in class that you hang out w during recess and after school. And you'll be comfortable within that group, it can be taxing on people to break out of this comfortable circle and just know random people. I don't put in the effort to mix w you don't mean I don't like you, it's just that I don't know you. 

3. Those who do look down on people who cant do academically well, its just them being assholes and obviously not educated enough to see past the grades. And who taught this assholes that they're superior if they 'clever'? You mother, your father, your uncle, your auntie, 

4. For my secondary school, like a neighbourhood kind, we've got a good mix of people, rich and poor, slightly popular for its ah beng-ness. I didn't see the segregation due rich and poor here. The the express student classes got some combined class among themselves, for classes NA, and NT is like completely no overlap one. So no chance to interact during lessons. But when CCA starts all come together all play together all go camp go training etc together nice what. About common interest, we mix damn well when we go Dota together. There's a group of people I would avoid from NA, NT, not based on their academic performance, but they and their temper wanting to show their attitude, want fight all. Even within the NA classes, there's the clear segregation between those who're nice and hardworking, and those that're just to be the little gang boss all. 

4. Then what's with the name ""NORMAL"", usually when something is majority then you use normal right? Well, back in 2015 about 66.2% of pupils who took 2015 PSLE qualify for Express stream in secondary school. Then naming itself feels slightly insulting sia, it's like calling people ""The tall and the taller ones"", everybody gets what you're implying there and just because you use the word it don't mean it.

This idea of class is taught into the children. They learn these behavior from who those close to them. A passing remark or attitude towards a cleaner like ""eeyer"" with a condescending look, children see children do. Over emphasis on academic result, you don't get the A, you are going to sweep the streets. Instilling the idea that cleaner = bad, and getting A = good. From young probably every single bloody parent drill this idea into the kids mind. You don't get good results in school, you will only be doing what lousy jobs earning little and be poor. From the perspective of the kid, they just want to be able to get what they want, and parents also give this idea that you got money you get what you want. This whole chain of toxic ideas in the kids mind develops the overall form of class and social level. And they wonder where the stress for academic result comes from. Even when a child's family isn't like that, when he goes to school and interact w all the other kids that have this idea of class, and level, he'll still learn this. The kids are coded w the idea that academic results are the only avenue they've got, leaving them w severe anxiety when they are unable to perform. 

Look at the poor NA, NT kid, they have the intention to learn and work. Anybody who is earning a living for themselves should be seen w respect. They not leeching and creating trouble, they are contributing citizens. "

But it's only the presence of the huge amount of educational materials that can be considered a library. So, I still stand by strongly that books are the priority of libraries. As much as NUS libraries try to increase the amount of study area, hope that you know there's only so much they can do.

FYI the libraries already have certain levels, which are called closed stacks, whereby they keep past journals and books. For these books, only when the students or staffs request then will the librarian go to these close stacks and collect.   "

Let's admit it. Maybe I am not clear in my previous post. I did not try to categorize passion and money to be mutually exclusive. In fact, if you found something that has passion and is accompanied by high salary, I will definitely be happy for you! What i am referring is if you are in a point where you got to choose a route with either passion with low salary or a route with no passion with high salary, my advice to you is to choose the route - ""No passion with high salary"". Better to be upset with cash rather than upset with no cash.  Eh, must think far la...This is Singapore okie! Next time when you grow older and IF you decide to start a family, you need to buy house, buy pamper, buy milk, buy food, give your parents money, child expenditures...etc. All of this need money. How much can your ""high passion with no money"" able to support all of this ??? Even if you decide to stay super frugal, after deducting CPF, how much will your disposable income left? At that point, you will constantly be looking towards payday everyday. Of course, there are few people who choose with ""High passion with low salary"", either you decided to stay single forever or you come from a rich family. I am in my mid 30s and just wants to share my opinions. To those people who thinks that being money-focused is a bad thing, bored or narrow-minded, I agree to you that it is stressful and worrying. But let me tell you...you are saying all these now because you are currently studying and not paying for all the expenses. Who is paying for your electricity bills, water bills, internet bills, home and your food? It is your parents right? You do not even need to worry on ""where to stay"" because it is provided by your hardworking parents who are money-focused to give you a better and easy non-money focused life. If you were to finance for your own stay, market rental rate is approximately $600 already for a hdb room. Total cost of living minimum at $1k.

I can't help but rather find it amuse by someone who can really rant at my post. You are a university student but the way you write and think sound like a kid to me. First, what do i gain from writing? Nothing. Why so upset about it? There are so many important things to do in life. Why will you even need to condemn yourself to rant on someone post. And when you want to debate or to share your views, try not to add insulting words to it. What is the point of adding ""extrinsically motivated ass"" in your views? This statement is so ""try hard"" to insult me. If you can be easily upset over a wall of text, life will be difficult to you in future. Debate and share your views amicably. And don't think too highly on yourselves that ""Singaporeans never fail to disgust me and let me down time and time again"". Who are you to think that Singapore let you down time and time? LOL.

PGP is actually quite secure btw, just remember to lock your door, tabao food for dinner and stay for your laundry to finish in the laundry room so that there are no accidents haha xD 

I have met people studying more technical majors who looked down at me after I said I am from FASS. I chose my majors because I am interested in my majors unlike a MINORITY who looked for a major with high employment although he/she has no interest in it

I want to say that not everyone is academically talented. 
Everyone has their own strength which may not be a technical skill like engineering. It can be entrepreneurialship skills or essay writing skills. There won’t be newspapers without writers and reporters, students without teachers and so on.

Every degree is useful, but how to use it is another story. Many of us won’t even be working in the same sector as what we majored in 20 years down the road. Trust me!

Ps. It was quite funny seeing people discriminating me as someone who did worse than them for A Levels and then treat me in a different manner after finding out I’m a ddp from an ‘elite’ jc. Those are the people I would avoide being friends with btw. Advice from a Y3 PGP FASS student."

3941,55836,"Personally as someone who has graduated with an business degree, I must admit that the choice between choosing arts and a ""practical"" degree is definitely worrying. But having been in the workforce from one of the big companies, there are generally quite some stereotypes and some generalization that are very apparent.

For one, business students are perceived as one of the most selfish and self-centered. Secondly, there are really quite stubborn and insist on financial theories which were taught in their finance classes without being open to new perspectives. All the viewpoints given are really very closed minded and parroting what the textbook would say, without having their own opinion.

On the contrary, my friends who were from arts degree are definitely more critical and provide the company with views that are more directed. Granted, they are well versed with finance theories, but when they form their opinions of the world, it is amazingly interesting and surprisingly accurate. Their views have a much higher accuracy rate than those from business degrees. 

You can enter finance industry (barring fields like audit since you really need an accountancy degree) with any degree - there's no barriers to entry. You only need 10 minutes to understand simple concepts like time value of money and WACC and probably a day to fully appreciate how to read a balance sheet. That's all. The value that business degree sell, based on my experience, is worthless since anyone can really pick up those skills with ease.

Final words, arts student have a more vivid and colorful life, and coupled with their success, you really envy them for not having a dull life at all!

Also, nearly half of my division are from arts degree, and they are doing significantly better than those who were from business. (Surprise? Not really, kind of expected considering the education both sides went through)"

Let's admit it. Maybe I am not clear in my previous post. I did not try to categorize passion and money to be mutually exclusive. In fact, if you found something that has passion and is accompanied by high salary, I will definitely be happy for you! What i am referring is if you are in a point where you got to choose a route with either passion with low salary or a route with no passion with high salary, my advice to you is to choose the route - ""No passion with high salary"". Better to be upset with cash rather than upset with no cash.  Eh, must think far la...This is Singapore okie! Next time when you grow older and IF you decide to start a family, you need to buy house, buy pamper, buy milk, buy food, give your parents money, child expenditures...etc. All of this need money. How much can your ""high passion with no money"" able to support all of this ??? Even if you decide to stay super frugal, after deducting CPF, how much will your disposable income left? At that point, you will constantly be looking towards payday everyday. Of course, there are few people who choose with ""High passion with low salary"", either you decided to stay single forever or you come from a rich family. I am in my mid 30s and just wants to share my opinions. To those people who thinks that being money-focused is a bad thing, bored or narrow-minded, I agree to you that it is stressful and worrying. But let me tell you...you are saying all these now because you are currently studying and not paying for all the expenses. Who is paying for your electricity bills, water bills, internet bills, home and your food? It is your parents right? You do not even need to worry on ""where to stay"" because it is provided by your hardworking parents who are money-focused to give you a better and easy non-money focused life. If you were to finance for your own stay, market rental rate is approximately $600 already for a hdb room. Total cost of living minimum at $1k. If let's say that you are to survive on your own, will you still think that ""Aiya , money is nothing la... "". Talk is cheap. True?

3949,55822,"Recently I purchased an iced coffee from Utown and they did not give me a straw. This is the first time since the straw ban that I bought a cold drink without a straw.

So I thought it was alright to try out the straw ban. Oh boy was I wrong. The iced coffee was filled with ice and every time I tried to drink, the ice will reach my mouth, making it difficult to sip on the coffee only. On top of that, the coldness of the drink hit my front teeth and the tingling sensation of coldness in the front teeth strikes.

Every sip of the coffee brings agony and frustration. The coldness hitting the front teeth. The ice constantly reaching my mouth instead of the coffee. I threw the entire cup away after only drinking a quarter of it. I am totally on the side of environmental conservation, but not at the cost of bringing agony and frustration to myself.

Before you say I could order a hot coffee instead, realize that all these problems and frustration would not have arise with a straw.

I wouldn't say PGP is the cleanest but definitely reasonably clean. Rooms are fully furnished. More quiet as compared to halls, where there are lots of CCAs and activities happening.

3957,55803,Insights from FASS can never be found anywhere. I am inspired greatly on how much I have learnt from FASS profs esp GEH1075. I can never think the same way again with such knowledge and it will definitely be useful in the future. Appreciate all the work and dedicated profs here in FASS :) Thank you to all passionate profs in FASS. smiley face :)
3958,55800,"For the whole FASS debate, I respect those who have taken an Arts degree for what it offers rather than for the sake of merely getting a NUS degree. (hence the term dumping grounds) These are the people who are truly passionate about what they do, and they need not justify THEIR decision to study FASS. Whatever they do, we have no right to impose our judgement on them whether or not they have made a right/wrong choice.

However, I think those against FASS have a point here especially for those who are considering FASS as a last resort for the sake of a NUS degree. We should be thankful for them to voice out a perspective of a potential reality that they would face while finishing the course and when they graduate. 

However, At the end of the day, all of us have to be true to ourselves and pursue something we are passionate about. (Not just because of other’s views and opinions) A Uni course is not entirely definitive about one’s future but instead it is your own passion, drive, motivation and adaptability that shapes what you do in the future. At my final year in Uni with multiple internship experiences, what I have learnt in University may never translate 100% into what I do in the workplace. Instead, the knowledge I have learnt here exists at the back of my mind that would have definitely helped me in my area of expertise, but only to a certain percentage. The major factor is your drive, your adaptability, and the motivation to learn new things in all workplaces we may be at. There are Engineers in banks, Science majors in the consulting industry and pyschology majors in the data science and analytics industry. So who’s to say what are your limits based on a major you take? YOU are your own enabler, and you are what you make of yourself. Be true to yourselves people. "

It's bugging me even more since she's very cautious and insists on protection with me.

I don't usually ask about sexual history, but it came up during a checkup and I don't know how to deal with it.

To give some context, I am a sociology major who's graduating soon, which some may consider as even more “useless” than majors such as econs and pol science. Considering I will be finding a job soon, the issue definitely speaks to me.

FASS in a nutshell encourages its students to constantly question and find out more about the human world, which is always useful considering we live in one. In sociology, we learn that almost every aspect of our lives are shaped by human intentions, interactions and social structures and organisations. Social interaction can be seen as the foundation of society. Even before we convey and share ideas with people, we observe particular etiquette and norms when interacting with others. There has to be a particular mechanism at work that promotes stability in social life, allowing us to cooperate and collaborate instead of us seeing each other as threats, kicking in our survival instinct. But who defines these norms?

Using medicine as an example since it was mentioned in another post about its usefulness. We don’t deny that. But what goes into defining a particular sickness? Of course we look at the different symptoms. But going deeper, we see that even definitions itself is agreed upon by a group of people (doctors), making it socially constructed. So we question further; who are these experts? People in power? Where does this power come from? Who are the people who sanction and fund these efforts and what are their intentions? This goes for other dimensions of social life too. What is defined as success? So going by the capitalist society and definition, it is material aspects and productive value. We can go one step further. In light of our capitalist society, so what is the true purpose of curing someone who is sick? Is it really for our own well being? A more critical Marxist may see it as an attempt to cure an individual merely so that they can rejoin the capitalist workforce and continue producing.

These questions cannot be taken lightly. Each individual, while a member of society, could have their own agendas and beliefs while simultaneously being exposed to society’s general values as well. The Singapore government only recognises heterosexual families and allocates benefits to them. So how does this affect those in a same sex relationship? Is this stance truly because of our society’s supposed conservative and religious values or is it giving value to the ability of heterosexual couples to have children, which in turn will help the government to ensure continued availability of our workforce for our economy in future? Those who are in support of our society being more inclusive will say it is a human right. Again, we question. What makes someone human? What is human nature? Does everyone truly deserve the same rights? Is sacrificing social stability in the name of upholding human rights justified? Examples are littered throughout history about what happens to society when an extreme ideology takes hold.

FASS students strive to find out the actual motivations and reasons for what we take for granted. You’ll be surprised how many people take a lot of aspects in our daily life at the surface. Our majors provide the rigour by constantly encouraging us to consider different perspectives. There is no one model “answer” to all our social problems. It is a constant balancing act. I may hold a particular view but others may see it in a different light. This is where discussions really help, seeing the strengths and weaknesses of each argument. Studying arts and humanities alone in your free time will not grant you this opportunity. FASS is essentially a study about humans and the different aspects of our lives, be it through the lens of linguistics, history, psychology and others. We see how small entities can actually have a great impact on how we live our lives.

Am I worried about my job prospects? I do think there are people, like myself, who are definitely apprehensive. But personally, I would still choose to major in sociology if given the chance to change my choices. Because I have learnt so much not only about society and life, but also myself. It gives me perspective on what I truly treasure in life. I’m more of an easy-going person so I believe things will fall into place and I will eventually find my place in society. I do acknowledge that some people may not hold the same mindset.

Perhaps the reason why FASS graduates are unemployed is not because we don’t have any skills, but more of being unable to find jobs that align with our values. This is of course the ‘ideal’. We have seen how capitalism has indeed brought about progress, but at a number of costs, like our environment, marginalisation and our personal wellbeing. Unfortunately, we do still need money to survive. So we may be forced to conform and just be another cog in the system.

The other option is of course to strike out on our own. There is no one true path to success and an answer to how one should live life. Besides, it’s about how you can utilise the skills and knowledge you have gained in uni. You can choose to be a spoke in the wheel or you can break the wheel :)

The point is you need to know what you want rather than expecting your degree to lead the way. If you are entering FASS expecting to be hired as a data analyst/software developer then I guess that's just pure stupidity. A FASS degree is no handicap in the corporate world at an exec level, many companies are willing to hire generalists as long as you have the necessary skills. By skills I don't mean ""communication"" (bragging) skills but real skills like proving you can events plan, you can coordinate, you can f*-ing do paper work. You need to be really good at at least one thing. 

Now the question is really how? Get an internship that will build your skills + resume, internships that allow you to handle a project, etc. Have some work experience to talk about when you land yourself a job interview. Do yourself (& your recruiter) a big favour by talking about something outside of your school or even cca (for god's sake). Prove that you are ready for the corporate world and oh, don't rely on the school to find you jobs. Work your own ass and start you job hunt process early. 

As an encouragement to all FASS students, there are companies like mine willing to hire students from all FASS disciplines. My co-workers are from Georg, Psych, Econs,... You name it and we have it! Just learn to market yourself and not your degree! That's equivalent to saying ""oh i graduate from pol sci i will make a good prime minister"". Lastly, whatever you do, get a good honours.

1. Seniors, please don't complain excessively about your courses because this is going to raise unnecessary fear among juniors like me and make some of us lose motivation, despite the seemingly numerous opportunities that university offers us to make us ""more employable""
Not a very hopeful start to university

2. Stop comparing yourselves to each other. If you want to compare, compare yourselves with millions of people who don't even have access to education

4005,55732,"#55709: As a biz student, I don't agree to that at all. There's some things about business just as useless as an arts degree and some things definitely more useful.

First of all, for all this talk on degrees, can we please just stop generalizing degrees? Especially an arts degree? Or a biz degree for that matter? There's many different components you can choose to specialise in and it depends on WHICH you specialise in.

A business degree for example, is just plain common sense if you take say, marketing or HR. 
'Pay employees more to retain them better'. Wow, mind-blowing. Who knew. 

'Good branding makes better sales.' Now go memorize the entire definition of what a brand is and all these irrelevant marketing terms.

You could literally chuck some coffee shop uncle in a HR/marketing job and he can do the job the same. Maybe not as efficiently but still the same work. 
These job areas require more EQ than IQ, which I guess... is equally important anyway...and girls love this for some reason.

Meanwhile specialisations like accounting, biz analytics, and finance are very technical and require heads-on knowledge that isn't general at all. As a biz student, it's an insult whenever I hear them say business is general knowledge. It's really not, if you plan to go in the banking sector or something. The stuff you learn is really not easy and straightforward. 

For arts, there's also different usefulness depending on what major you take. 
If you take something like philosophy, I gotta agree, it's enlightening but kinda useless. Maybe you can become a lecturer or write books no one reads then contemplate so much on the meaning of life, mind body and soul, then you end up falling into a deep depression...

But if you take others like political science or economics, you can certainly contribute in the government sector as an analyst or something.

4010,55725,"Am an engineering student that likes to make fun of FASS employment prospects, but to be completely honest, I think FASS is the best option for anybody who has the drive and passion to pursue the arts and humanities.  

The entire question is predicated on the myth that employment for FASS students is much lower than other courses - let me be clear, there is absolutely no truth in that statement - there are similar employment rates for students across different faculties (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/graduate-employment-survey-ntu-nus-sit-smu-sutd), and although there may be differences in starting pay and career progression, I'd argue that that's not the point of a degree. The sort of thinking that you should always choose the route that's the most 'practical' (which, lets be honest, is just a Singaporean euphemism in place of the word 'material') is the same sort of idiocy that breeds people who love their careers but hate their work - the type of person who lives for their weekends but finds no passion or drive in their daily 9 to 5 other than their next paycheck or promotion.

There's also been arguments that the arts can be pursued as a hobby instead of a degree, which I find utterly ridiculous. Trust me, if you think you can pursue any FASS discipline as a hobby and achieve any rigor approaching an academic level, you're probably so deep into the Dunning-Kruger effect that you've not even scratched the surface of the subject you're talking about, like people who claim to have quantum physics after watching a bad Discovery documentary."

Unfortunately (or fortunately), I had the chance to work since a young age of 14. Through a series of part-time work, internship, overseas volunteering and NS, I've noticed that one's educational qualification is never a good indicator of one's performance on the job or job ethics. I've met people without degrees and most of the time, they perform much better than scholars at the workplace. At the end of the day, it's your soft skills that matters. Skills that the school does not teach you explicitly that will bring you further ahead in life. Cheers and happy holidays!"

4043,55678,"Regarding the Arts and Social Sciences thing...

I was from Engine. And I am now working in a field totally unrelated to it. I feel that whatever I have studied is not relevant. Basically, if you don't work in a field related to your study, you are even more useless than FASS people.

In fact, those FASS colleagues of mine, their knowledge is sometimes more useful. They are better at articulating and seeing things in a totally different light. It is just damn impressive whenever they bring out sharp alternative perspectives. Those perspectives often result in fundamental shift in company directions/preferences. 

Granted, they can't really execute the shifts due to their lack of technical skills, but i guess that's why many are in civil service doing policy planning. Just look at how intense our 30-year plans can be.

I don't know. Their value cannot be captured easily by a line in resume or a cert. It's really ""cannot see it clearly but can feel it strongly"". 

It's hard to put a price tag on it. But their role are damn important i tell you.

4044,55677,"Admin, please do not filter this. I do not understand what is with all these blind hate about arts degrees. If you really want to be so disparaging about it, then let us put things into crude perspective. 1) Are science degrees any better? As far as I know, your science degrees have even worse value than arts degrees, since a) you do not have the soft skills that HR recognises in arts degrees nowadays and b), laboratory positions are so limited that I am sure they are not keen on just a bachelors of science and c) your body of knowledge is even more niche than the arts and social sciences (say, Political Science, Global Studies, History etc) to even be connected to the real world (and do not tell me about pharmaceuticals - get a MSc or a PhD then you say). 2) Let us follow the stereotypical notion of arts degree holders only having teaching to turn to. Hey, why not right? Arts subjects are always in demand in the teaching service anyway. As far as I know, science and math teachers are already hypersaturated in numbers in the service. So who is more at a disadvantage now? Arts or science? I think people are just jealous that there is always that 'stereotypical' job that awaits arts people since you 'useful' degree holders can go on jobless for months given such a competitive job market that you all are very proud of. Since you started the ball rolling, let me go on. How about business degrees? Well, one does not need a business degree to even start a business right? Okay, you may then say how about professions like auditing and accounting and etc. Well, I just do not like to have my life sapped away by such styles of work and thus even if I could do a business degree I'd rather do an academic degree that I know I will enjoy (i.e. History, Literature, etc etc)? You see, you all claim that one can simply read up privately and be on par with arts degree holders in terms of critical thinking and knowledge. Don't be delusional honey. I am sure my fellow FASS people would generally agree that the level of critical thinking and intellect in faculties beyond FASS is just sorely lacking. Look at yourself in the mirror please. That if you can sprout so much nonsense in dissing arts degrees, your EQ is probably just not that high I guess. But it is okay, it is just that our education has failed you and thus breeding off an defective product like you. At the end of the day, do not project your inferiority complex of not being able to handle arts at university upon us. =)"

4052,55667,"@#55664 yo, imagine if someone said ""just use the internet"" for learning anything STEM. I realize that ""just browse the internet"" is a common sentiment for arts, and it's bizarre to me. 

I have no doubt that you are well-versed in history, and I myself am not from a history background, so I'm not qualified to comment on that. However, I do know plenty of people who think that, hey, if I like casually reading books, then I love literature, and I'm on par with lit majors. But reading isn't analysing. Anyone can read a storybook lol, analysis is a whole other thing. Why do people think it is so easy to ""self-major"" in anything arts-related? 

To give a STEM example, would you hire someone who claims to have learnt engineering off the internet, and has nothing else to show for it? Sure, you can self-learn stuff like coding, but that doesn't apply to every STEM major. Similarly, for arts, would you hire someone who claims to have learnt psych off the internet, to be a psychologist? 

The way that arts presents itself as accessible is a good thing, and I completely support people who treat it only as a hobby. But nowadays there are lots of hobbyists whose only info is youtube videos, and they think they are experts...
And they ask why people major in any arts field, when clearly you can just watch youtube videos... These also tend to be the ones who say that arts research is written only to ""sound smart"" and ""impress other philosophers"", because they can't understand it. 

Lastly, I believe that everyone has differing aptitudes. Yes, generally, arts has a lower employment rate and salary (by the way, did you know both stats are even lower for life science?). However, we are not all perfectly average people who are perfectly average in our every trait. To give an analogy-- did you know that most people who won the olympics for shooting, did it with their right hand? Does this mean i should start shooting with my right hand? No, I'm left-handed.

A more on-topic example: you are very good at geography and you love it, but you are very bad at engineering and hate it. In that case, why should it matter to you that the general population generally, on average, earns a bit more as engineers? That's a generalization, a median or mean (depending on what you look at). You are you. If you are absolutely the top of the geog cohort, you could end up being paid decently for working in that field, and have a fulfilling life doing what you love (I'm not a geog major so this is just an example). It certainly seems much better than barely passing through 4 years of engi while being absolutely miserable, and then be stuck in a job you hate for the rest of your life, never being promoted and ultimately earning less. 

So to everyone, stop letting general trends dictate your life. You may not be a representative sample of the general population, so that's just absurd. If you are great at it and you love it, do it.

I do agree with what you wrote to a certain extent. Many of us studying in FASS do know that we are studying something impractical. Let's just be honest about it. Arts is fluff. Do consider the intake of FASS too where it is around 1700 people. 1700 people with no marketable skills fighting for jobs? Those who want to come to FASS-please take this factor into consideration too. At the end of the day, for A-level graduates, it is your life. Do plan ahead for the future.

Left nus with a regular honors. My grades were decent at best compared to my peers, but I managed to clinch an average paying marketing job, before my graduation actually. Fast forward till today, I'm sitting in my personal office with my name branded on the glass wall in the heart of cbd. Unfortunately I can't divulge my roles and where I am for obvious reasons but my ex nus/ntu interns would definitely know my story. Currently a partner in one of the bigger consulting firms.

Hardwork, network and even more hardwork is what I had to put in and fight for to get to where I am. Countless forgone weekends and sleepless nights was the price. Getting a reputable degree can only give you that much head start. Many of my clients were ex fass graduates and some were even from fortune 500 companies.

To my fellow arts undergrads  juniors, every discipline is important. Most hr departments hire across various disciplines, they would be unwise not to. Hardwork and discipline is the only mantra you should get an A+ in. Cap5? Probably not as impt.

4087,55619,"PGP is seriously the worst place to stay on campus. Everywhere there is ALWAYS construction happening, lift maintianence and whatnot, also there’s always some problems with the electricity or water where they have to cut the supplies suddenly. The toilet cubicals are ridiculously small, and there are always insects on the walls of the cubicals. Not to mention the shower head is so short it’s almost always touching my head. 

But there’s no other place to stay, is there? If you’re a year 3 or 4 it’s highly unlikely any hall will accept you in because of priority given to freshmen. I really wish there were more residence options on campus. "
4088,55618,"Help pls. I fainted today on my way to my examination. I got a medical certificate, then called my prof and he said to apply for special consideration because there is no re-test. I then checked to see what the information required were, and basically I needed the doctor to fill in some additional comments. (So I'm probably going to the doctor again). The thing is, my doctor told me to go to A&E since I hit my head a little bit, and I have fainted before in 2014 and 2016. I personally don't think it's a huge issue and it's probably due to stress or lack of sleep. So I end up being afraid that if I go to the hospital and tests say I'm fine, would that make my situation even worse? What if the school thinks I faked illness or something? Not to mention going through all the tests would be expensive af >< 

Also, if I happen to pass the module without counting the finals (although I doubt it since its 45%), would my grade be incomplete or would it be the grade that has passed? 

Anyone has advice? Especially if you have ever missed an examination in NUS for whatever reason? ):

4099,55601,"Sitting inside the ever-so-crowded Starbucks once again, I cannot believe that I am back here more than a year after the end of my undergraduate days, with a Masters to spare and uncertainty at the top of my head. And I'd thought I'd just be back here in Utown for a day or two, but it had been two or three days every week since that return from my year-long adventure 11000 kilometres away.

It's as if I'm 'omnipresent', once again.

For I cannot escape the reality, that university has always been a comfort space for me, to rethink and re-calculate my direction for the present and future.

It was in NUS where I roamed around with great aplomb, taking pictures and memories with every passing year. I still fondly recall the rush of adrenaline that sinks in with every orientation camp; where the youthful energy that I see in the eyes of every university student sinks into me, where it promises me that there is hope in this generation that I belong in, where we have the capacity to make and change the world and turn it into a better place. I fervently loved every photograph that I made in this university landscape, so much so that it had inspired my ensuing research, for it became something that had become a part of me for the rest of my life. And I feel so privileged to have known thousands of people of whom I will regrettably never know in detail, yet who pops out at every corner of the school and greet me with an enthusiasm that had worn off from my soul, a greeting that reminds me that I did something impactful, meaningful, and possibly noteworthy in nature.

In NUS had I managed to reclaim and rebuild my social standing, from the days of my wretched past school life. In NUS had I managed to find an inspiration and a way of contributing to society, and remind myself that I was actually somewhat important and had the potential to change and influence the world somehow, even in the midst of my current uncertainty that lurks in me as I navigate another job interview that ends in failure. And in NUS, had I managed to find a faculty so worth defending and of which had I managed to contribute a geographical and 'photographical' history and made a research interest out of it. I had done what I did, pursued my photography adventures here time and time again because I owe my rather crazy - and tremendously brilliant and colourful - faculty for all that they had inspired me.

And I will owe this, for the rest of my life.

For sometimes, it made me cry inside with tears of joy - and tears of self-importance. For I am as vulnerable as so many of you out there - the aspiring busker, influencer or henna artist, the self-doubting entrepreneur or the future public/civil servant and MOE teacher that propagates around me ever so often. I, like many of you, crave so furiously within for that recognition and reassurance that I always felt I lacked, of which I still feel in short supply with seemingly infinite deficiency. But as I look back on every poignant orientation camp that I've talked about endlessly like an old person on his/her last decade of his/her life, I cannot help but thank every senior and junior who had been a part of this amazing journey of mine, whenever I run into each of you in school or otherwise. This is what I owe all of you, the you who's struggling to stay afloat in finals that's concluding really soon and in every academic semester, the you who straddled into my life path or photograph or geographical landscape, the you who were part of this university fabric, the you who somehow inspired this very vulnerable soul who just wanted to fit into society and yet who constantly felt too different, too out-of-place, too dispensable. You, are so important to me, in words beyond essays, in words beyond photographs, in words, beyond existence.

Now here I was earlier yesterday, sitting in the Utown Green sipping another cup of bubble tea, staring out into another night here and enjoying the silence that I feel with utmost ease. I'd learned to be comfortable on my own and enjoy my personal company in a society that's in constant flux and endless change. I'm still juggling my personal struggles in finding a job (it's been 3 months and I feel like I'm not trying hard enough while doing so in vain), hearing of my contemporaries and juniors getting married or engaged a pair at a time, and feeling my batchmates in university grow increasingly distant and completely exclusive with every passing moment of work life. It's as if, I'm always left behind time and time again. Yet I find it alluring - and addictive - to be quite different, sitting here and finding my feet in a space that I also call a home and an atmosphere of recovery. My time in the picturesque and comforting English seaside towns and that peaceful Swedish cemetery had further trained me to ease my soul, and I hope that you all could feel the silence somewhere and somehow, that comforts you like it has done so for me.

I am still fighting my daily battles for my relevance in society, for the pursuit of something that reminds me that I still matter. But this university is the place where I continually seek to rebuild myself, and remind me of glorious and fantastic days past, and the people who were once here and are still here, but of whom will move on, slowly and eventually, like the rustling and fall of leaves with the flow and passing of every season or moment in time. 

To all those who had been a part of my life here, in materiality or in spirit, in space or with time, I wish you all the best once again. You are all in my heart in one form or another, and thank you so much for giving some of the best days of my life. Thank you for reminding and affirming me that I can do something in this confusing world.

I owe this community too much for me to let it go. And I'll never let it slide, for the rest of my life. It means the world and everything to me, and hang in there, wherever you all may ever be.

And I'll be forever grateful.

Always :)"
4100,55600,"Frankly I think that #55578 has some point here. Most of us just want to graduate with a degree and at the same time learn some useful skills to apply to workplace. Not everyone cares about research as much as the professors do and to place a heavy emphasis on research while not focusing on teaching and imparting knowledge to students who mainly pay to learn would be in essence mean that we are producing less capable students, who go on into the economy to work. Some professors are paid highly, but to churn research which benefits university, which in turn boost the rankings of the university, but to be honest, deep down we all know that NUS as asia's #1 university and its worldwide ranking is highly debatable. Tell that to any alumni and they would probably secretly snigger at the thought that NUS is ranked higher than Yale. NUS has been playing this ranking games for the past few years, but frankly speaking, the calibre of its students probably cannot rival those in the top of china such as Tsinghua or Peking university. I have taken the famous MA1512 and many other terribly taught modules in NUS and am not impressed with what the top asia university has to offer. Ultimately, i don't think NUS would care that much about undergrads as much as the grads students as long as research plays a bigger role in the rankings and it remaining as a research university. Also, comments that say that ""don't go university lo"" are not really helping, instead of coming up with toxic comments, why not come up with better solutions to improve the educational landscape?"

So, it's been a while, huh? I'm here to tell you, that sorry for being a few years late, but do watch the news on Friday, Dec 7th, or Saturday, Dec 8th. I did say something about building buses a few years back, eh? And I hoped that you'll see it.

Well, after many delays, and much of literal blood, sweat and tears, I've finally able to show you what I've built (aside from that modification I made to the nus shuttle buses, the front handrails are pretty small and unnoticeable, but hey, it's something). 

It's not much, it's a type of bus, not electrical or anything, nothing fanciful, but one day, I hope that you, and my other friends, will be taking one of the buses that are built under me.

4141,55549,"Can people stop whining about how hard their lives are compared to others? The rampant self-pity here is quite pathetic tbh. It's as though some of you expect to be given shit without working hard for it. No friends? Did you even put in the effort to make them? Bad grades? Did you reflect on the way you studied? Low self-esteem? Stop tying your self-worth to your grades and pursue something you are interested in. Of course, if you have some sort of medical condition or illnesses,  this doesn't apply. But statistically speaking, most of you here are able bodied. Get out of your bubble. If you really tried your best and failed in these 4 years, I'm sure even you will be proud of yourself. "

4151,55534,"Hi #55301, OP of #55237 here, just to clarify some things - she's been fangirling over him ever since they met in one of their course mods, and basically gushing about it. I'm not saying that it means anything, but she's been emotionally distant since she met him, and it seems that even though they just met they're abnormally close. I'm not sure about how you see it, but for me it's slightly alarming that they go home together almost every day, and I'm pretty sure that their timetabling can't be so ""zhun"" that they're in the same class for literally everything? Either he shifted his classes around to meet her, or the other way around.

Maybe it's paranoia or just me. But I can't shake the feeling that people don't get so close to each other that fast in under a semester without something going on behind the scenes. I've mentioned that she's been emotionally distant, and that we haven't seen each other much of late since we've been rather busy. But despite the emotionally distant part - she seems to be rather overeager? Like she's emotionally distant, but on occasion it seems like she's trying to make up for something and seems extra nice and stuff. I know that sounds weird, but to put it more clearly, she seems nicer and happier, but less emotionally involved with me? It just seems like she was trying to hide something.

I thought at the time that it could have been just my paranoia too, but the speed at which she got with the other guy was alarming - it was barely a month after we broke up, and I wouldn't say our relationship was on the rocks. I heard she went home with him barely a week after we broke up, and she wasn't the type to jump into bed with just about anyone - for us it took months, so I'm quite sure of some things, I just don't have any evidence. Yeah, I know I'm insecure, but I made it a point not to badger her about her male friends, I only asked cause he kept coming up in conversation.

I've been trying to find evidence of it for some time now, but I can't seem to find anything. I've been stonewalled by her friends and sometimes even by mutual friends, and she doesn't seem to accept follower requests anymore - her social media seems to have gone dead.

I know it's still conjuncture on my part, and I know all of this might just literally be me overthinking, but it's not a good place right now. All of this is hindsight, and I'm not sure of what I'm seeing, so maybe I may have been too accusatory. I'm just confused right now. TBH, all my friends tell me I'm overthinking this, but my head's not listening.

I know it's time to move on, and that maybe I'll never get closure from her, but it's hard I guess...

Anyway finals have ended for me, so it's just me, my thoughts and I again..."

I wonder if this is a cultural thing-- I remember the exchange student's post about constantly getting curt replies or silence, and someone else telling me it isn't like that in Southern Europe.

But from the posts here, it seems like men spent a lot of their energy staring at, whining about, contemplating, fantasising, and struggling to romantically confess to feminine girls. So maybe they also prefer befriending feminine girls, because then they can cling onto the hope of the friendship becoming a relationship? I wouldn't know.

4224,55435,"Hey NUS people, I'm an exchange student and after a semester here, I've grown to love this uni. One thing really intrigues me though. I stay in a residential college and it is a habit (in my country) for me to say good morning to everyone I see in the elevator when I'm heading to breakfast or to class. Sometimes, while walking to class, I would make eye contact with people passing by, and give them a slight smile. I wonder whether it is seen as creepy or rude to do it in Singapore because I have never gotten a response to a smile and a good morning greeting would make the rest of the elevator ride really awkward. Singaporeans would shift their eyes away from me or take out their phone to escape the awkwardness. It is always other exchange students who reciprocate favorably.

On my first week here, I approached a local student at Business and asked her where is the best place to eat on campus (because I thought she was cute and wanted to talk to her). She gave me the most curt reply and hurried away from me in the opposite direction. After that, I realized that talking to strangers is something really uncommon here. I usually ask strangers for recommendations whenever I am in a new city and I felt really weird doing it in Singapore. 

It is my first time in Asia and I found out that people are generally kind and open once you get to know them better but close to 100% of the students here are shy with strangers. Is it just me or do you guys feel the same way too? Also, if no one dares to hit on girls on the shuttle bus/ around campus, how do locals even meet girls?

I found myself smiling too as I got reminded of my friend's cute smile during some event we attended together months ago.

Ever since then, I keep getting flashbacks of her, from small little things she did that was dumb then but somehow now it felt cute to me as I remember them, to other things like asking me for help instead of easily searching Google for answers. I see interesting things and funny memes and the first thing I can think of is wanting to share with her. Occasionally she randomly appears on my mind when I am studying for finals.

She probably just see me as another one of her friends. I think that she actually has someone she likes too. I have no intention of letting her know about my feelings, I am happy staying near just as a friend. Perhaps as an evergreen I am afraid of rejection, but deep down I am more worried about losing someone close. After all, as long as she is happy, that is enough for me.

Dating has been interesting; but hard because whilst most guys say they want an independent girl, but yet can’t seem to really handle it.

Please do not misunderstand, I have a great life, I really do and I love it enough to not put myself in dangerous situations like jumping off something or cutting- Heaven forbid, I will never put the ones I love in that saddening scenario. Thus, I am even more so confounded that I am having these thoughts more often.

 I only realised that when my dad jokingly asked ""you should put on a seatbelt, you want to die isit?"" to which I answered ""haha no"" but I thought to myself ""...that actually wouldnt be too bad..""

I love what im studying, i love my family, and i love myself. And nothing will change that. Life is good. And logic dictates that I should feel happy, because I have nothing to be sad about. But here I am, wondering if a potted plant fell on my head and killed me, I wouldnt be too upset about it.

Isnt that so selfish of me? I dont think im depressed per se. Im just losing interest in things that i used to love like spending time with friends, or studying (abit of a nerd here) or even going on a holiday. I dwell in mind-numbing stuff like youtube (urgh) and just staring into blank spaces.

4282,55334,"Referencing to #55284:

Why do people seem to be condemning the OP? I feel like it is alright to go on dates with different people provided that no party involved is exclusively in a relationship with anyone. For me, I see going on dates as trying to figure out if that party's values are aligned to mine, eg said person might have common interests with me but while going on dates and having more interactions I realised that the person has conflicting religious beliefs w me then I won't pursue the relationship further. And I don't think going on dates are ""crossing the boundaries"" if it does not entails ""couply acts"" like holding hands, kissing etc. 

Is it because it seems to be unfair if one party already likes the other and would be very upset if she/he knows that the person is actually going on dates with other people? "

Jesse: This is...This is like a...a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet. This is like, ""Oh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me.""

Walter: Yeah, so...so where do you transact business? Enlighten me.

Jesse: I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza. Nice and public. Open twenty-four hours. Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza.

Yeah, tip for everyone meeting someone you have never met in person before: choose a public place with lots of people.

4300,55301,"Hi #55301, OP of #55237 here, just to clarify some things - she's been fangirling over him ever since they met in one of their course mods, and basically gushing about it. I'm not saying that it means anything, but she's been emotionally distant since she met him, and it seems that even though they just met they're abnormally close. I'm not sure about how you see it, but for me it's slightly alarming that they go home together almost every day, and I'm pretty sure that their timetabling can't be so ""zhun"" that they're in the same class for literally everything? Either he shifted his classes around to meet her, or the other way around.

Maybe it's paranoia or just me. But I can't shake the feeling that people don't get so close to each other that fast in under a semester without something going on behind the scenes. I've mentioned that she's been emotionally distant, and that we haven't seen each other much of late since we've been rather busy. But despite the emotionally distant part - she seems to be rather overeager? Like she's emotionally distant, but on occasion it seems like she's trying to make up for something and seems extra nice and stuff. I know that sounds weird, but to put it more clearly, she seems nicer and happier, but less emotionally involved with me? It just seems like she was trying to hide something.

I thought at the time that it could have been just my paranoia too, but the speed at which she got with the other guy was alarming - it was barely a month after we broke up, and I wouldn't say our relationship was on the rocks. I heard she went home with him barely a week after we broke up, and she wasn't the type to jump into bed with just about anyone - for us it took months, so I'm quite sure of some things, I just don't have any evidence. Yeah, I know I'm insecure, but I made it a point not to badger her about her male friends, I only asked cause he kept coming up in conversation.

I've been trying to find evidence of it for some time now, but I can't seem to find anything. I've been stonewalled by her friends and sometimes even by mutual friends, and she doesn't seem to accept follower requests anymore - her social media seems to have gone dead.

I know it's still conjuncture on my part, and I know all of this might just literally be me overthinking, but it's not a good place right now. All of this is hindsight, and I'm not sure of what I'm seeing, so maybe I may have been too accusatory. I'm just confused right now. TBH, all my friends tell me I'm overthinking this, but my head's not listening.

4301,55300,"If you’re thinking of confessing to someone, read this post before you do so. Please at least make sure that y’all are good friends before confessing, chances are even after you’re rejected, it’s still possible to stay friends. Recently I was confessed to by someone in my CCA in hall, it was super awkward because I’ve never even went out with her one-on-one or had deep convos with her personally. Whatever interaction we had was purely only during CCA, it felt more like an infatuation rather than a serious liking. From then on, I couldn’t help but avoid her because it was simply too awkward. I just don’t feel that way towards her and it’ll be weird to become friends AFTER the confession,  it’s like any interaction feels like I’ll be leading her on. So conclusion is seriously don’t confess if y’all aren’t even good friends to begin with, it’s impulsive and you’ll be very sad when the person starts avoiding you (but seriously can’t be helped)"

4305,55296,"Just finished the final paper for CS1010S and I have to say, this must be my worst examination experience ever, after 3 years in NUS.

First off, I was seated at the back of MPSH-1B and somebody's phone was ringing on and off for a good half an hour. I could see an invigilator trying to search for the source of music but she gave up after a short while. Is that the correct procedure to resolve this? There should be one for this case right, amidst all your rules about what to do in case of a fire and all. So it is okay to just let this disturb students? I believe we were all trying our hardest to ignore it but in a stressful situation whereby mere clicking of pens/ shaky tables can tick students off, this is completely intolerable. 

Next, I had a question for the prof as I needed clarification and it took me half an hour or so to get it settled. I get that it is a big hall with lots of students, but there were lots of invigilators walking about too. I raised my hand for a long time, trying to get someone to notice me before giving up and skipping that question. When someone was near me, I asked him and he said I had to ask my prof for the answer. Er, hello??? Obviously I cannot get to him, you would have to help me. He asked for the prof's name and said he would help. 15 mins went by without anyone answering my query and when I decided to ask for help again, I noticed he was just standing at the back of the hall, staring ahead. WTH? I was this close to walking up to find the prof myself when another invigilator finally noticed my raised hand and she immediately took down my seat number, my question, and approached the prof for me. I got my answer within a minute. 

By then, there was only an hour left. I spent the first hour trying to do my paper whilst raising my hand constantly to get someone to answer my question + trying to ignore that annoying music. Needless to say, I could only fully concentrate after that hour.

I cannot believe this. In which situation is having a cell phone ringing for an extended period of time + having invigilators who are unwilling to help, acceptable in an examination? Please, do improve on this and not let this happen again."

This scene from Breaking Bad season 1, episode 7 ""A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"":

[Walter and Jesse are meeting Tuco at a junkyard]

Jesse: A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place?

Walter: What's wrong with it? It's private.

Jesse: This is...This is like a...a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet. This is like, ""Oh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me.""

Walter: Yeah, so...so where do you transact business? Enlighten me.

Jesse: I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza. Nice and public. Open twenty-four hours. Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza. Hell, why not the mall? You know, wait at the Gap. ""Hey! It's time for the meet!"" You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius. Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco, you know, comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death.

Yeah, tip for everyone meeting someone you have never met in person before: choose a public place with lots of people. If they don't show up, you don't look like an idiot standing in the middle of an empty lot and there are things that you can do at that location anyway.

Turns out we weren't really official to him.

Though we knew each other since secondary school, having been in the same elective programme and meeting at a joint school workshop, we didn't get together till much later since he was in a long term relationship at the time. After jc we went out and decided to make it official, and when he enlisted we stopped meeting so often. There wasnt much time since he was in camp a lot because of his appointment and because it was somewhere ulu near changi Airport, he'd showed me on the map before but I forgot, it's been 2+ years so well... But anyway that was kind of why we didn't meet up much. It took a long time to get back to civilisation.

All through it he was sometimes really tired, but he'd still make it to our dates and stuff, and head over to my place afterwards. I found out later after we broke up over something else that he'd been seeing some other girl from his JC behind my back, and I'd actually met her before, but he told me she was just a good friend.

I don't think you sleep with your good friends.

Oh well, saw him in school a few days ago with another girl again. Wonder what happened to his other girls, but nah not really.

Should have been slightly warned by the fact that he was in his first relationship in sec school despite being in a boys school... And then after JC I was his 3rd ""official"" but I suspect like 7th ""unofficial"" ? Like wow man, that's quite the turnover rate."

I believe that you are seeking to live a simple life with a partner.

I hope that you are not discouraged by some of the negative comments as sometimes it is alright to just ignore the typical viewpoint and do what you believe it is right for you as long as you are happy. It is okay to not follow what most people do nowadays as everyone has their preference to live their way of life.

Whether to cut loss depends on things like whether you need this sum of money in the near future for a wedding, house, loan, etc. Next, it also depends on your reason for entering into nvda - investing or trading. 

If it's investing based on fundamental values, reassess it's value again based on its recent balance sheets and decide for yourself from there whether to sell it. If it's still fundamentally sound and you don't need the money in the near future, you can consider holding on to it for the long term. 

If it's for trading, I'll personally cut my loss and take this lesson as paying school fees to the market for not setting a stoploss. For trading, holding onto a trade that goes against your setup has an opportunity cost of entering into other money making trades.

The thing is, I can't talk to his parents because we do not have a common language at all. I have discussed this with my bf before, and our career goals and parenting philosophies align. He wants to make something out of himself, and not just rely on his parents' money, and I intend to pursue my higher education and career as well. He motivates me to want to work harder/smarter, be a better daughter, and a stronger leader. I also really like how we match up in terms of academic performance, ambition and drive, yet still manage to make time for each other. I know some people may say ""just elope"", but I cannot neglect my duties as a daughter, and I will never allow him to hurt his parents like that.

I don't really know how to comment, but people say when a person marries, you don't only marry to the person but to his/her family as well. Unless your other half is willing to, go against his/her family, but in normal circumstances, it is really difficult. 

One of my parents have strained relationship with my other parent's family, which I never knew why and I had to bear substantial pressure, when gradually I was asked every year ""Why didn't your xxx come back?"" Until a certain time, they finally realised the answer was clear. And for almost a decade, I never visited that parent's family. I was also made to bear grievances from that parent.

It could really be a problem that extends to your child. Think carefully and take care. I hope for all the best in you"
4366,55204,"#55180: My wife and I just had our 2nd year anniversary. About 3 years ago I was in your position: my parents were opposed to our relationship since we were from different socio-economic class and ideology (if that can be counted as such). What I found to work is for both of us to be determined to never give up, standfast, and never compromise on the idea of being with each other. In dealing with my parents, I parried all attempts to convince me that can have a better life with someone else. I acted in a firm, but polite way. No dramatic stunts like getting marriage certification behind their backs, getting my GF pregnant, etc ... We had our fun and all but we are committed to the idea of being together to the end.

One contributing factor is my cousin's dream marriage (in the eyes of my parents: families from prestigious backgrounds) crashed and burned during that period. Seeing what they thought was perfect obliterated right in front of them probably changed their minds."
4367,55201,"Coming from the polytechnic route myself, I sometimes do wonder if the JC students do secretly look down on poly students because they think that we are not as smart and will not perform as well as them. Do they genuinely want to be friends with poly students?"
4368,55200,"I've been reading through various posts on suicidal urges, depressed confessions, the stress of exams, the vain pursuit of grades, the overwhelming feeling of inferiority and the trashy feeling of being used as an tool for someone else's gratification. I think everyone is feeling quite upset for various valid reasons. 

While studying for the exams the past week, and feeling really caught up in all the negativity, anxiety and self-doubt that pours forth everyday, incessantly - I had an epiphany and I would like to share it. 

It would probably sound very lame for some people. It's probably an axiom that self-help books preach all the time. You might have heard it come through the lips of your friends/loved ones. I might have heard it before as well - but when you genuinely connect with that thought at a deeper level than just reading words or hearing vocal sounds, its full impact hits only then. 

Here's the realization I had: we must learn to preserve a part of ourselves, whatever this 'part' means to you - that is impervious, independent and absolutely inviolable from whatever happens outside of you, from whatever happens TO you. I know it sounds like some philosophical bull that makes no sense. 

In other words, no matter how badly you flunk your exams, no matter how many times you get rejected by your crush, how much insults have been hurled at you, how many fun occasions you have been excluded from, how little friends you have, how mean people are to you: 

Please keep a part of yourself protected, sacred and cherished. This part of your mental sanity, your pride, your dignity - whatever it is: you need to create it, find it, own it - you need to keep it safe and sound. Just think about it as if you're on a flailing ship caught in the middle of a destructive storm, and amidst that tossing and turning, slamming from side to side: there's that one thing on the ship you choose to hug tightly to your chest and you know you will never sacrifice it to the biggest winds that blows, or the sharpest lightning that strikes.

This is the part of you that will remain truly yours, and for no one and nothing else to handle. Never let the hardest exams tinker with it, never let the biggest crush tamper with it, and never even let those you trust hold it; not even delicately. You and only you have the right and the power to choose what happens to it. Yes, maybe it's selfish - but it's necessary.

I believe that when you can find and protect this one part of you at all costs; external conditions and events can still hurt and damage you, but you won't be utterly destroyed into unrecognizable ruins beyond repair. Because this part of you, this sacred inner core of yours will still survive, and after the wave of disasters - you won't be the exactly the same person, but you will still be you, somehow. And you, like this inner core - will still survive.


TL;DR - PROTECT YOURSELF!"

Here's the cliche moment. I find myself increasingly attracted to him but he's already attached. I've never dated before, and I try to find someone I'm interested in (dating apps included). But somehow I can't help but think about him, especially when theres such a stigma still surrounding mental health, and its hard to have friends to understand and stick with you through everything. He's a really great guy. Everything between us has been and will still be platonic, and I have no intention of changing our friendship despite the attraction. He is also open with his gf who understands he's just being a supportive friend. We're just meeting occasionally when in school to talk, and I don't want to distance myself or stay away, as I do need someone who understands me that I can talk to, especially during the times where I am distressed.
I know it's wrong to allow myself to like him and to think about him that way. Why is it so hard to control feelings? I like him because of his reliability and consideration, and I feel comfortable confiding in him, but it's also something that someone out there may have. Its just, after so long I still can't get over him even when I bury my feelings deep, deep down. Fellow girls, how to you try to get over someone?

2. The fragile egg became hardened.
3. The ground coffee bean changed the water into fragrant coffee.

4384,55178,"I have a Friend (I’ll be referring to him as G) who’s in love with this girl and it’s a complicated relationship to say the least. The gist of how it started was that the girl confessed to G bout how she likes him,G started to talk to her, allegedly both fell in love with each other but due to circumstances, could not (and still cannot) be together. They text regularly but from what I’ve heard he hasn’t seen her in a very long time. 

G is very passionate and has a tendency to put people first, in the ways that he thinks matters, like buying them meals often. So In the case of this girl, he is so smitten with that he straight out splurges on her. Just yesterday, he bought a charm that cost him a chunk of his salary (he’s an intern - you can imagine his allowance). He’s done this several times for her.

What I don’t understand is that he tells me that she doesn’t act like she cares. Like she only thinks of herself. Doesn’t ask about him at all when they text and he tells me that hurts him, because he’s not sure of her feelings towards him and whether it’s the same as it was before. He tells me he wants to get out of this - whatever this relationship is - but at the same time he tells me he loves her and because he’s so empathetic and passionate he’s afraid she will “break” if he ends this. And he wants to always put her first. He has also told me his logical side is telling him not to continue but his emotional side is telling him to keep in touch with her. I tell him to actually tell her that he’s unhappy - at least she might be more aware but he doesn’t want to because he says he’d rather see her being “happy and oblivious” than to try. 

Can anyone help me understand this? 

J, if you’re seeing this, and I know you browse this site regularly, I don’t know if you’re just plain oblivious to this or looking for him only when you need him for your own benefit, but just know that just because you’re “not obligated to do anything” doesn’t mean you can take advantage of him and use him as your emotional footstool.

Relax? What relax? You get good grades, end up with a good job with good pay, but again, you're working even harder in the working world. Especially for jobs that have a lousy work-life balance.

The world is unequal and some people can wreck the bell curve effortlessly. But have you thought about how they got there in the first place? Perhaps they were born with it or perhaps they started working hard earlier than you or perhaps had access to more opportunities than you. So what is the solution? Give up while you are in your twenties and feel inferior for the rest of your life? Or start working hard to catch up? And don't say you are working hard because you spend 3 days on 1 chapter -- I'm pretty sure you spent 80% of that time on Instagram or Facebook instead of actually studying or you are merely reading through the notes without digesting or applying the information. Think about how you can work more efficiently rather than whine about the fact that some people are born more intelligent than you.
To people who say that your grades don't matter in the workplace -- that is true to a large extent. What does matter in the workplace is your work ethic. Constantly victimising yourself and complaining about how unfair the world is does not reflect well on your attitude. TL;DR stop whining, work smart and all the best for finals"

Please lah... I've heard of people wanting to transfer from CEG to CS because the curriculum is too unmanageable and difficult ><

And plus, the CEG course is AT LEAST 80% group work leh.... You think what? Just study mostly theoretical stuff and get good grades...? They have to apply what we learnt in theory also, and they need to get along with their groups in group projects. Their course has a lot of modules with hands-on things to do...

Anyway regardless, we will be marked down in our group projects if we possessed a low EQ.  This applies to anyone, regardless what course.

4421,55120,"One our first session, there were only 4 members, including myself. Everyone talked to me, except you. I initiated the conversation with you but you did not seem interested. Among the other two, one was an exco and the other was a new member like me. I had no problems with the rest. We were laughing and having a good chat. I knew you were in the exco too. I am the friendly kind and likes to keep people around me happy so this kind of made me a little sad.

A couple of sessions went by and you still did not seem to like me. I had to initiate conversations that you still seem uninterested in. Then, more new members started coming in and you seem to interacting with them really well. You seem to hang around this handsome dude and for the first time in my life, I saw smile and laugh genuinely. Haha, not judging here.

I could not come for one of the events and I knew you were organising it. I messaged you that I could not make it since money was involved. Amazingly, you have disabled the blue ticks so I did not know if you received it. You did not reply me, not ever. A simple ""Its ok""  would have sufficed. I don't think you are so busy that you cant' reply with 2 words. What is your problem? I interacted with you so little that I can't think of anything that might have offended you. I always talked to you when we are in a group, never alone. I felt really uncomfortable going for sessions and even thought of quiting.

I joined a lot of CCAs this sem to just try out. In every CCA, everyone, ESPECIALLY EXCO MEMBERS, are welcoming. The presidents or vice would go around interacting with everyone. They might not get close to us but they still check on or just say ""Hi"" to us from time to time.

When I look at my peers in the same course it's just scary how far ahead some of them are? There's this particular clique of mostly guys in my course where all of them are ridiculously competent to the point where they are basically impossible to beat as a team...

They've got one guy taking a double degree and overloading crazy amounts, people doing iDCP and clocking the 75th percentile without breaking much of a sweat, and still one of them has a genius level IQ and one is legendary in their JC... I thought that maybe they're all dudes and so they're like better at focus or maths or something, but no, even the girl in their clique is able to process the information so much faster than I am? Is that even fair? Me and my group of friends can debate and debate all week and still not get anywhere with our understanding, and these guys basically breeze through the semester scoring average marks with pretty minimal effort compared to us.

What is this even? How are people born with such good talents? I'm literally dying, sleeping at 3 and waking at 7 to get my revision done for TWO papers and I'm not even halfway through - and they're Monday and Tuesday next week. These guys probably manage about a chapter of revision a day... I take 3 days to clear a chapter, minimum.

It's not even funny? Is uni supposed to be this hard? I've put in so much effort on a daily basis and still I'm far behind these guys. My CAP is barely touching 3 and I've used up my available S/U, and I think I'm not going to do so well this semester.

4454,55071,"For as long as I know my Best Friend (3 years) whenever I asked him if he was interested in anyone, he would always say no. But recently, he say he is interested in someone. I am quite encouraging and ask him to chase after her. I keep asking him to send her a message, ask her out for dinner but he is not very receptive. He always say he will do something tomorrow. But one day, he told me that if he really got a girlfriend, he would have less time for me and asked if that was really what I wished for. Currently, we are living in hall and hang out with each other every day. It kinda feels like a routine you know? I feel that I will miss him but he deserve happiness. Hence, there is this conflicting feeling. Moreover, he asked me many weird questions recently as if he is trying to make me confess to him the feels (may be just me). Some questions he asked include why do you choose to talk to me over other guys in our OG? Have you ever liked me? Why do you choose to hang out with me?

He was always there to listen to me, entertain me and was a really nice friend. I know it is finals and I should be studying but I can't get his questions out of my head. Do I really like him? honestly, IDK. 

I don't have butterflies when I see him. I don't dress up especially nicely just to meet him. But he is always there as my listening ear, seen me in my worst and best state, probably the person I am most comfortable with, knowing all my secrets. 

I have never consider him more than a friend despite all those ""shipping"" from others because I believe that they are just too free. But when he asked me if I ever like him and if I will ever like him, I really DK. Technically it is meaningless if I like him or not as there is already someone else he is interested in and Idk what is wrong with him, asking me about all these at this point in time.

4460,55063,"I’m the poster of #55982 and #55063 condemning girls having fwb. I’m disappointed with the comments yet again (albeit some are reasonable points and I’m addressing them below). Please don’t comment if you don’t have a point to make and all you do is name calling and giving sinister remarks (eg. One post just comment “TLDR”. Seriously? What an useful comment, trying to attract attention?) I’m here to advise girls on self love, moral value and chastity. There’s an urgent need to fix our tattered moral fabrics. 

Sorry I’m gonna ignore all the useless comments and address a few key issues that surfaced:

1. Stop mentioning about causing harm! John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism and principle of harm is an absurd moral framework don’t you see it? Let me enlighten you: eg. Let’s say cheating with another man when you are married is morally wrong (if you don’t even agree with this, then you are really morally incorrigible). However, what if you are so good at cheating such that your husband can never find out? According to your harm principle logic, the act will miraculously become moral because there will only be harm if you get found out (eg. Husband feel hurt, parents feel disappointed etc). Basically, it is echoing “you can cheat as long as you don’t get caught”. It’s so superficial and absurd. Furthermore, I’m not even using utilitarian framework, why do you insist that you only ascribe to utilitarianism and ask me for harm mechanism?

2. Consequentialism is also a ridiculous framework (for goodness sake, please wiki on it if you don’t know prior to commenting, if not you will just look shallow). Why? For example, you are married and has sex with another man because he drugged you. If based on consequentialism, you are no different from a cheater because the final outcome is that you had sex with another man when you are married. It’s so absurd!! The framework failed to account for intention, ie. Good intention that lead to bad (due to bad luck etc) outcome will be deemed bad. 

3. Postmodern ethic is even more absurd. It adopts moral relativism and everything depends on context and culture. At its bare foundation, it’s basically power, linguistic game intertwined with cowardice to take a stand on moral issues. Basically, everything become subjective and opinion. Seriously? 

Some people may not grasp what I mean, I’ll elaborate a bit more clearly. Tom like strawberry ice cream and Daniel like chocolate ice cream. These are called OPINION and PREFERENCES. Postmodern ethic is basically attempting to change all rights and wrongs into subjective opinion and preferences just like how Tom can’t say Daniel is right or wrong to like chocolate ice cream (eg. Fwb is personal preference. It’s subjective whether casual sex is wrong.) Whether extramarital affair and incest is right or wrong will also become merely preference and subjective opinion. 

Can you imagine how dangerous and chaotic the world will become if everything is subjective? There will be no objective right or wrong or truth. Everybody can disagree on everything and nobody will be right or wrong because there’s no judge or benchmark. Is that what you want when you encourage people not to be judgy? Refusal to stand up against wrong vices such as fwb, and sugarcoat it into personal preference and opinion so that you won’t offend anyone is a classic example of cowardance. The society is getting too fixated on criticising judgy behavior to the point that principles and values are eroding. 

Do you all see the problem? Morality cannot be subjective and change based on context, time, or culture. If you think it will, then you have not truly grasp what morality is because you are merely talking about social norm and socially acceptability. Morality is so different from social norm for goodness sake. 

So what’s the fundamental philosophical issue here? Ans: there needs to be some form of moral GROUNDING and anchor in order to have objectivity. Virtue ethic is the grounding and anchor for human flourishing. Some comments questioned why virtue ethic is the best? Why these virtue and not others etc.. The key is: you cannot question why!! Why not? Ans: because it is the fundamental axiom. What is an axiom? Axiom is an irreducible primary. It doesn't rest upon anything in order to be valid, and it cannot be proven by any ""more basic"" premises. 

We need axiom because if not, we will run into the infinite regress problem. Eg. What is human made of - cell. What is cell made of - atoms. What is atoms made of - proton, neutron and electrons. What is proton made of - quark. What is quark made of - dark matter. What is dark matter made of? Do you see the problem? You can ask “what” infinitely and it will never end. That means there must be some irreducible primary that cannot be questioned even further and that is axiom. 

Examples of axiom are: Parallel lines can never meet. Probability can only range from 0-1. Do you question them? You don’t!! Because they are self evident and are irreducible primary!! It will be insane if you say to your math teacher these are dogma!! 

Virtue is similar to “parallel lines dont intersect and probability range from 0-1”. It is an irreducible primary axiom of moral philosophy that is self evident and cannot be questioned, but it is NOT a dogma. You cannot question the cardinal virtues because they are inherent good, ie. the essence is good and you can’t doubt that the essence of virtue is bad. You can resort to intellectual dishonesty or play verbal games by twisting virtue into bad things (eg. coining terms such as “fwb virtue” or “wisdom of murder”), that will just make you look childish. 

All right... this is not a philosophy classroom and I don’t want to bombard layman with things they can’t grasp, it will just bore them out. 

I just wanna say, I am currently attached for 2 years and neither me nor my gf have any tainted fwb history (hence I’m certainly not an incel nor some desperate horny guy). In fact, I broke up with a girl before she wanna have sex with me before marriage. 

I’m amused that a lot people are annoyed by my superior and holier-than-thou attitude. Because you know what? I don’t even see myself as superior or holier. I’m just a normal person. The fact that you feel I’m holier is because your reference point of “moral normality” is so low such that you feel I’m holier. 

Girls... please stop lowering the moral benchmark even more. If not, nude women walking on street might be the new “morality” in future. Don’t be used by men, please! "

But what if we really do end up having sex in that trip, am I obligated to tell my parents (should they probe and ask?) that we actually did end up having sex and have them worry and probably judge me?

4496,55003,"Hello, I'm genuinely curious so I hope the admins can let this pass.

In quite a few of the group projects I've seen, people seem to insist on conducting face-to-face meetings, but I'm not seeing why there is a need for f2f specifically instead of conducting online meetings such as voice chat. 

It seems that proponents of f2f claim that people can ""work on things much easier"" or something along those lines, but this can also be done in online meetings through Skype or other applications that have screensharing (+ you don't need to literally cram around 1 PC in f2f).

Another reason why some people think f2f is superior is that people are forced to be more attentive during group meetings, but that's not guaranteed either just because you can see the other person's face? Can you really vouch that you're giving your full attention during f2f meetings as well?

Sure, body language, I will agree that f2f can let you see body language easily. Then again if you really need to see body language that much, you can also host video sessions online as well.

I really don't understand why some groups insist on f2f meetings, especially for things such as ""status updates"", or ""compilation"", because unless you're working on a physical product like a prop or something, the meeting will just end up with people sitting around 1 table, and looking at their own screens. How is this different from doing it in your house instead?

You don't waste time travelling and waiting for the inevitable people who are always late. At the very least even if the same person is late for an online meeting, the rest can start first and don't need to crowd around the meeting point wasting time waiting for the last person.
There is less tendency for discussions to go off-topic (I realised this is mainly for JC-era projects but it can still arise if your group can be divided into distinct cliques). Meetings on the weekend that account for lunch are particularly guilty of this.

No, group meetings are not the same as outing with friends so saying that group meetings are an opportunity to hang out with friends is not sound either, that just makes you less likely to focus on the meeting itself!

I hope someone can enlighten me on this because I'm really not seeing any merit for f2f meeting outside of projects that involve physical props, but it seems that this is still the ""default model"" so convincing them that online meetings are better is unlikely to work (at least in the attempts I've tried due to democracy).

In any case, online discussion doesn't just mean connect to Skype and only use a microphone! There are tons of other features such as screensharing which makes it easier to convey what you are trying to say rather than fumbling over words."

4512,54968,"After getting into my first relationship, my BFF and I gradually stopped talking to each other. It wasn’t over any one fight, but for multiple reasons. The major one being that I realised she could not be happy for me, even in the early phases of me simply dating him. She often made sceptical and disparaging remarks about my BF, and made me feel bad about my relationship with him, so I stopped sharing about my dating life with her in detail. I tried to keep her updated but she never seemed too interested or happy for me, so I stopped completely. I still made it a point to talk to her every now and then, gave her gifts for special occasions and asked her to hang out whenever I had time. She never really did the same (didn’t initiate convos with me, didn’t give me any gifts, never asked to hang out). Since it was (is) my first relationship I was pretty caught up in it for a while, so I ended up sharing my love life with other friends who weren’t negative like my BFF, and who instead helped me through tough and confusing times. 

Now that it’s been almost 2 years with my BF, things have settled down into routine and I’ve since realised I feel very lonely (without a BFF). When we stopped talking, she seemed to find another BFF in her uni mate so whenever I see her instastories now I feel abandoned. She has since mentioned to me in passing that us drifting apart was mainly because of her and her issues, not me. I told her it was ok, that we all have our own issues to deal with, and that I’d always be there for her still. She hasn’t 
 really made an effort to re-kindle our previously close friendship, though.

I feel really alone because I’ve realised that everyone else seems to have a BFF or a tight knit of friends they talk to daily or can depend on anytime, but I don’t have that. I have several circles of friends but they have their own lives and own BFFs too.

I just wonder how many girls out there are in the same position as me, having lost their bff, and only have their bf to depend on left. I want to have BFFs again but I don’t know how to get any. Sigh. "

I live with my mum who has hoarding tendencies but thankfully I put in enough effort in housekeeping such that things (plastic bags, containers, magazines etc) don't accumulate, despite her objections. This can get annoying sometimes when I have a lot of work and badly need my weekends to rest. 

However, my aunt, who lives by herself in another flat down the corridor is a different story. Her dining table has only a empty A4-size section for plates because the rest of the table is filled with stuff she thinks are useful. The rest of the house is a big mess. One toilet is filled up with boxes and stuff. 

After ten years of having to go to her house for my meals (because my mum wants to be a good sister and cook for her), I made it clear to everyone that I would not be going to her house for meals.

1. right when I graduated quite some time back, I interviewed for a statistician position in the civil service, and one question was about the topic of my honours thesis. So I went about describing it in very vague terms at the start hoping to not scare them off with details, but someone within the interview panel probed for more technical details and the theory behind my thesis, and followed up with meaningful questions that was very relevant to my thesis. So yes not all interviews are filled with people who are totally uncaring about academia. They then told me that they were looking for people who are more competent in the theory aspect, while many of NUS statistics graduates are merely decent at model fitting and doing statistical tests.

2. Just 3 week ago, I went for a ""final-stage"" interview for data science position in a certain bank, after passing the typical initial interviews. Days before this interview, someone within the bank emailed me requesting for my masters research thesis, even though I have yet to official graduate from my masters. I replied telling him that the thesis was incomplete and that I have yet to officially submit it, but he told me it's fine and that the current draft will be alright. During this interview itself, we ended up spending 10-15 minutes talking about some blatant flaws within my thesis and the extra experiments I can carry out to strengthen my case. After this interview I checked the linkedin of this interviewer, turns out he has a PhD.

4535,54931,"To #54931 : Once you are financially independent you could see how you could move out and live by yourself. 

I live with my mum who has hoarding tendencies but thankfully I put in enough effort in housekeeping such that things (plastic bags, containers, magazines etc) don't accumulate, despite her objections. This can get annoying sometimes when I have a lot of work and badly need my weekends to rest. 

However, my aunt, who lives by herself in another flat down the corridor is a different story. Her dining table has only a empty A4-size section for plates because the rest of the table is filled with stuff she thinks are useful. The rest of the house is a big mess. One toilet is filled up with boxes and stuff. 

After ten years of having to go to her house for my meals (because my mum wants to be a good sister and cook for her), I made it clear to everyone that I would not be going to her house for meals.  

I have expressed the desire to live by myself more than once in frustration (because of the housekeeping and the long commute to work) but this is not really an option because my mum needs some care now and then. "

4538,54922,"To the OP of #54903 , this means your mother gave birth to you at 41 years. Woah, she must have been a really strong woman during the first 14 years being your mother-- most women go through menopause naturally between 45 and 55 years, and their body goes through some discomfort e.g. hot flashes, sleep deprivation, greater risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. This is on top of all the responsibilities and body changes she faced as a new mother! 

** I'm not saying all these to discount your feelings about not getting along well with your mom-- I'm sure you do want to understand her better, and for her to understand you better as well. **

My point is, during your most vulnerable time of your life, she has tried her best to understand you, provide for you, and be her level best compassionate with you. As the roles reverse, I hope we as young adults (me included because I can relate to your issue) can try our very best to be humble with our parents. 

I mean, if we know how much time we have left with them, if we find out just how much time we have left with them being of decent health, perhaps we will find that some things are not worth arguing with our parents about. Yes, you may see things one way, and your parent another way about how ""things used to work in the past""...but I seriously doubt that being combative and contentious works well in our favour to have our parents be more open to seeing our perspective...

Audrey and Miguel have really great points. For me, while my parents are not users of social media, I try to share with them about some social media happenings..yep, even memes! I also confide in them about some things at work/school, and save up to treat them to meals/outings out sometimes. The point about avoiding certain subjects can be quite difficult-- as it was for me during my late teens/early 20s...because younger me held the ostentatious view that ""I'm more informed, so I'm right, and since I'm right, then you're wrong""... until I learned that it isn't really like that in life! 

One thing I realised about parents when their children are in their 20s (esp if you don't come from a moneyed background) is that-- they have insecurities about aging and/or growing old alone, and while they really want their children to come around, grow up quickly, and be independent adults, at the same time-- they want to protect their beloved babies the way they know how :-p

4540,54920,"Dear #54920 and #54896

I didn't bother to read any of your entries, I stopped at ""suicide"".

I have a cousin who is recovering from his second battle with cancer and never once did he attempt suicide.

During his treatments, he continued to attend school, this is despite feeling like hell due to chemotherapy. He also frequently visits the children's cancer ward to talk to children, listens to their hopes and dreams, while being hooked to an IV himself. All of the nurses knew him as the most cheerful patient they worked with. He did all of this despite not knowing if the treatment was going to work, whether he would live to experience his next birthday. He continued to live life to the best that he can, and we all know that a massive spectre of uncertainty is haunting him every single second. 

He went through multiple surgeries to remove tumours, a copious amount of chemo, and a bone marrow transplant, which I don't have to tell you, is one of the most challenging procedures in medicine. He spent months in quarantine after the procedure. We could visit him but we would have to be separated by a glass wall. Despite all of that, every time I met him, he smiles and tells me ""it's life, if it were easy it wouldn't be worth it"". He has so much positivity, so much strength, despite being in circumstances that is orders of magnitude more pernicious and tragic than anything any physically healthy people will go through. 

Having cancer is both an emotional and physical challenge, especially being diagnosed in 20s, not in your 50s like everyone else does. He made a choice. He never once stopped fighting, and always took things one step at a time. All his doctors could tell him was ""try this, and try that"", none of them have a guaranteed solution to treat or cure him. But even when his dreams were on the line, he would always say to me ""who knows, they might invent a cure tomorrow.""

Here we have someone who loves life, who loves people, who is fighting to live just one more day in order to make lives better for others. On the other hand, we have people who are making foolish attempts to end their lives, despite being born in a first-world country, and having been given the chance to attend university. Life is unfair. The odd thing is the people to whom life has been most unfair to, are always the ones whose lives are most treasured. If you do not appreciate life, then just end it, you don't have to complain about how others have been unfair to you, nobody cares and nobody wants to know. You have been unfair to yourself, because you can't even do the one thing to your own life—protect it. 

If you are curious, yes, I am diminishing the challenges you are facing. Grow up. If you can be rational enough to write a coherent post on the internet, rational enough to decide to share your story, I'm sure you are smart enough to understand that you have a choice. If you choose to end up in a situation where you don't think it is absurd to commit suicide, then I don't think anyone deserves to hear about it. "
4541,54919,"#54919 #54944 While what you have said is generally true that most employers don't care, I would just share 3 job interview experiences out of <10 in my entire life (yes I am lucky) that explicitly referenced my thesis. I was a statistics major.

1. right when I graduated quite some time back, I interviewed for a statistician position in the civil service, and one question was about the topic of my honours thesis. So I went about describing it in very vague terms at the start hoping to not scare them off with details, but someone within the interview panel probed for more technical details and the theory behind my thesis, and followed up with meaningful questions that was very relevant to my thesis. So yes not all interviews are filled with people who are totally uncaring about academia. They then told me that they were looking for people who are more competent in the theory aspect, while many of NUS statistics graduates are merely decent at model fitting and doing statistical tests.

2. Just 3 week ago, I went for a ""final-stage"" interview for data science position in a certain bank, after passing the typical initial interviews. Days before this interview, someone within the bank emailed me requesting for my masters research thesis, even though I have yet to official graduate from my masters. I replied telling him that the thesis was incomplete and that I have yet to officially submit it, but he told me it's fine and that the current draft will be alright. During this interview itself, we ended up spending 10-15 minutes talking about some blatant flaws within my thesis and the extra experiments I can carry out to strengthen my case. After this interview I checked the linkedin of this interviewer, turns out he has a PhD. I was almost feeling very worried because he was going to evaluate me based on my incomplete thesis, but turned out they offered me the position just days ago.

3. I also interviewed for a research assistant position within NUS. On the day of the interview itself, it was clear that he at least skimmed through my honours thesis, and knows what I am doing for my current masters thesis. He is on good terms with my thesis supervisor. 

While I acknowledge that it is perfectly normal for professors to skim through your research when interviewing you, my experience with the bank is clearly telling of the current trend these days, especially when you are interviewing for a tech/IT position. Many of your potential bosses are going to be PhDs, who are going to take an interest in the research you did. So it is best to give the thesis your best shot :)"

Groups exclude me in whatever they do, I don't feel ok to share and I never dare to ask their help since I am afraid I am a burden, but I always try helping in my ability. I don't know, I just feel like if I try to seek out, they will just take a step farther away."

4587,54842,"This post is in response to #54842.

I believe your friendship endures beyond physical intimacy and that this relationship was not built on sexual desires. You value it beyond the sexual satisfaction it has given to you. Take the first step of talking about the incident with your friend and ask him how he feels. Assure him that you value the friendship and through the vulnerabilities shared, the friendship will be strengthened on the basis of understanding and empathy.

Even if you find yourself attracted to guys, it is ok. Who says guys can only be attracted to girls. 

All the best and good luck."

  So I rejected his invitation for a meal together, and barely replied his messages.

This is a serious breach of privacy. I understand if checks have to be conducted but is it really necessary to invade the privacy of students like that? We are not prisoners. Even police officers require a warrant before they trespass into your personal space like that. I feel that it really displays hooligan like behaviour for office staff to do that to people. 

 In this AY, they even started conducting checks on EVERY room to see if lights and fans are turned off. Ok we get it, utility bills are high but does that really justify giving you the right to intrude on our space like that. How would you like it if PUB were to go to your house in the middle of the day and just walk into every room to check on your electronics? Do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do unto you.

ALL of you need to seriously reflect on how you run the hall. You are creating such a negative and toxic relationship between students and staff. I believe my complaints are not just applicable to Sheares Hall, but to every other residential places offered by NUS as well. If you wish to implore such draconian measures, maybe you should just run a student prison instead.

4600,54824,"I'm genuinely curious - why is ""ghosting"" even a thing? 

I don't mean in the context of online conversations since these taper out quite naturally but if people have met up or gone on a physical date at least once, why would anyone think that ghosting if they're not interested is a great idea? 

Isn't it basic courtesy to drop a simple text along the lines of: ""Hey, it was nice meeting/hanging out with you but I don't think we would work out romantically. Wishing you all the best!""?

I've never been in a situation to be ghosted before but I've heard of it happening to friends, girls and guys alike, and this phenomenon just seems so puzzling to me. 

Do people find it that hard to be polite and honest and provide some amicable closure? What reasons do people have for ghosting? I'm trying really hard to understand. "
4601,54821,"There's this girl I've been half in love with for... I don't even know how long now. I say half in love because it's really on and off. Sometimes I think about her all day and night and I go crazy when I don't see or hear from her. Other times I can literally go months like she doesn't exist. And it's not a want someone you can't have thing. She just happens -- No. We just happen to end up in each others' lives at the right and wrong times and it's always only one of us who catches feelings. Never both. We've somehow never been into each other or never allowed ourselves to be into each other at the same time. (God that sounds like some lousy rom-com). We've always been friends and though we sometimes drift further and closer nothing really separates us for long. We just wander back into each others' lives now and again and I never know what to do about that. It's strange that way. And my thoughts and feelings on whether we should get together really go up and down like crazy too. They're worse than the stocks. Once literally within ten minutes I thought about where we'd be in ten years, and then I thought we've got almost zero common principles, and then she looks absolutely gorgeous in that dress, and after that can't she ever disagree openly. Gut feeling tells me she probably thinks and feels something similar  (maybe more or less volatile too)  but lately / as usual I don't think we're both feeling it. It's funny. If I asked her out properly she'd probably say no now and in a couple of months she'd say yes and I'd say no and I'd try again too late and she'd randomly show up again too late and that would keep going on forever. Yeah. I really don't know what to do about that. Probably just focus on finals for now and see what happens.

Oh by the way I'm writing this because I'm reading this psychology book that talks about how it's really important to identify and address feelings and I thought this bit would be good practice. It's this book called Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman. The language is really fluffy and he sounds like a hippie most of the time but it's a got a few decent points and some practical tips for keeping emotions under control and for interacting with other people. Give it a try!

4602,54817,"I look at all these posts about people sharing relationship stories and I feel lucky that you guys have a partner to be with in the first place. I want to share my depression story related to this from back before.

Seeing all of you studying and eating together, holding hands when walking to and from class, lying against each others' shoulders, rarely sneaking a kiss on the other's cheek... I was jealous back then. I had only myself to blame that I was anti-social and could not mingle with others as easily as other people, while many other uni students can just get together like nothing happened. I was really scared of going to school, preferring to stay at home to mug instead of seeing couples in every corner of the school, because it filled me with regret that it's too late. Every other man is good-looking, athletic and knows how to flirt with girls. I am the ugly bastard in a manga, the beta male loser in the society, the chubby guy who will not score any good first impressions from any girl in uni, who prefer more handsome guys.

I began to question myself, where did I go wrong? What are my weaknesses now? Do I even have any qualities? Do I have anything that a girl will notice? Also I read up on what it means to be a boyfriend. Care and concern. Trust. Being there for your girl. Commitment. Most importantly: wanting to have a future with her. Like my friend asked me (before he himself got a gf): ""Why does a girl even want to be with a guy? For support? Why does she need support, if she is the same level of education as you anyway?"" 

Eventually after talking with my friends, I had three things I had to fix. My lack of confidence. Me being too much of a nice guy. And my weight. Not many girls will like a fat guy, being nice to everyone really doesn't have a place in this society, but no girl will ever like a guy who is isn't sure of himself. Guys should be the shoulder the girl leans on, if he is not even confident with himself... he is not confident that he will maintain a relationship with his girlfriend.

My weight now? I admit I have not been working out, sorry. (Tho I am trying to eat less, no carbs etc) But I am trying to work on my confidence with a bit of result. I am still the ugly bastard.... but I just hope my goal to be more presentable to others (and hopefully get a girlfriend) can push me on."

4635,54750,"Anyone finds it such a horrible idea whenever lecturers make their slides to have blank fields in them? 
Eg. A slide saying 'You need to ____ in order to...'

You can't read through the slides prior because of these lack of keywords and you can only fill up the annoying blanks when the lecturer goes through the topic on the day itself.

Another issue is that you lose attention during the lecture when busy filling up these blanks on the slides. 
When the lecturer is talking, everyone's busy filling up the blanks or whatever else. It's so stupid.

This also disadvantages people with attention issues who can't focus while listening and writing at the same time. I seriously don't get the point of why so many lecturers use this 'blank fields' practice for. If it's meant to have students pay attention to the lecture, it seems to be doing the very opposite of that.

4638,54747,"Not even sure this will even reach you, and not sure that you'll even know it was me, but I guess it's worth saying.

After this year, our school will close down for good, and I guess that will be the last place with our memories that will close up. I really enjoyed my time with you.

I know we were both in bad places at the time, and that we were in really bad relationships at the time too, and I guess we both just sought comfort in someone else who knew what it felt like too. I knew she was cheating on you, and I guess I just wanted someone who knew what I was going through as well.

We were both misguided people. The first time I saw you I thought you looked cool with that camera, running around taking photos; you looked oh so popular, stopping every now and then to talk to someone and you seemed well liked by the teachers, your seniors and your level-mates. Has it really been 5 years since that day in J1?

I wanted to get to know you better. So I asked you to help me and my friends take a photo, and well, things took off from there. We spent afternoons studying together, and we told each other stories that we thought would never get out. We joked about everything, from the ugly bluish-green of the uniform to the strange expectations of the principal to random posts on confession pages (how ironic it is that I'm posting this on one) When she left you on read for a month I was there to cheer you up, and I guess it was then that our moments of weakness started. We just wanted some human contact, having been deprived of it for so long, and I guess having someone who understood so close by, it was hard to resist.

I think we both knew that it wasn't meant to be. But I caught feelings for you all the same. Every time you left my front door at the end of the day, it felt like I was missing something.

I distanced myself from you in J2, and you got involved with one of your CCA mates. I wondered about it, whether I should make a move on you, because I couldn't stand the sight of you guys being together. But I didn't. I was too scared to make that move.

And then it happened. Apparently your CCA mate hadn't broken up with her boyfriend yet before getting intimate with you, and things turned ugly. And I wanted to be there for you, but I didn't want you to see me as desperate, or for you to be seen as some fuckboy who changes girls oh-so-often. But we lost contact. Your Instagram disappeared in J2, and only recently have I found your new account. 

You're happily attached now. I guess I'm just too late.

I wish you all the best :), I hope we can still be friends, someday, and you can maybe introduce me to your girlfriend as a friend, because I guess that's as much as I can hope for now.

I'll just try to get over you as best I can then. I guess I'll have more chances to bump into you next year when Techno closes down, and if I do, I hope you won't be a stranger. You don't have to say anything, or even acknowledge what we were, but I hope we can still be friends. Hopefully I'd have my feelings for you all sorted out by then.

You ended it so unceremoniously before you enlisted, and yet even then you'd still ask me out. It felt like we were still dating even after.

Now, one year plus into uni, and it still sucks to see you around, doesn't help that our canteen is shared. I'd get lunch at macs but you go there too sometimes. It just sucks.

Were we really nothing?"
4643,54735,"There is a senior from my CCA that I am attracted to. During CCA, he would often come over and chat with me (even though we are not on the same team) and is also very patient in teaching me. As he is quite shy and awkward around other girls, I thought he is single and maybe have some liking for me too. 

However I found out that he actually has a girlfriend. I might have felt better if I found out about this from social media or friends, but instead, I only realised when his girlfriend suddenly joined the CCA too. I tried to be friendly to his girlfriend and start a conversation with her when my senior left for a short while (after all I will be seeing her again so I thought at least we could become friends) but she just gave one-word answers which made me even more upset than I already was. She was only interested in talking to my senior even though my senior tried to include me and another guy in the conversation, and it became quite awkward that we left them alone. However I couldn't help but keep looking over to the both of them. I have never seen my senior so happy and talking so much before..

It has been a few days already but I still feel very upset. I really want to get over him but I can't stop thinking about him. I know it is foolish as it is just a one-sided feeling, but no guy has ever been so nice to me and attracted me so much before. I can't stop replaying in my head the moments when he introduced his gf and I was trying not to show my disappointment, and how he still looked out for me to make sure that I was doing fine. I still want to remain friends with my senior, but I really don't know how to act as if I am ok in front of him (and his gf) now :("

It seems like all my friend groups just stopped keeping in contact when we moved on to the next stage of life. (To uni, to JC etc.) It's quite depressing really, it makes me wonder if there is something wrong about me, or are most friendships this way? They say uni is the time you build the most precious friendships that will last a long time, but I am so doubtful. I am already in Year 4, and I can't really find someone I can be genuine towards. It seems like everyone communicates on a very superficial level, and you never really know what the person really feels about you as a friend.

4664,54705,"#54705 I get what you mean, and I think I had the same issue too. My ex and I lasted about slightly less than a year, and though he wasn't rich, far from it, he was really crazy smart and good looking. Last I heard he's keeping a 4.9 CAP, but during our relationship he'd go MIA too so perhaps it's working for him.

It was in the second year of JC that we broke up and while I understood that both of us had to focus on A levels being from a lower end JC (we got merged, even), I really hated the MIA period where he'd take like a day to reply to my messages, and sometimes reply only at the end of the week or so.

He'd tell me that we needed to focus on our studies, but I mean, we're in the same school, and the same CCA, so it's not really out of the way if we met up after classes... right? I thought I was being too clingy too, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

I guess he's moved on, he got attached to someone else less than a year ago, but I've not managed to form any lasting relationships since, and I think I'm still not over him.

I guess all I can say is do what you think is right? If you still have lingering feelings I guess it's best you work them out, with or without him. It's definitely not right to neglect your relationships over studies, at least not to the point of total MIA. I'm still trying to work my feelings out too, so I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but I hope you get your closure soon."

Background: I'm an Engin student and my major+DCP has a lot of group projects. I have five group projects this sem.

Recently, I found out from a mutual friend that two of my groupmates are intentionally slacking off. This mutual friend also informed me that they said they could slack off because they know that I can tank their parts. When she asked what if I'm not willing to tank for them, they replied that I have to because I need to maintain my CAP, and anyway this particular project has no peer evaluation.

So their thinking is that I have a lot to lose by getting a B, while they have less to lose since their CAP is already at that level. Thus they can relax because I will work my ass off to complete it anyway, since I'm aiming for FCH.

But what they don't know is that I still have extra S/Us. We'll see who has the last laugh."

Honestly, the replies to this post really disgusted me. How can ppl be so unsympathetic towards others, and judge others so quickly? So yes a depressed gf is likely to be portrayed as the victim, but have they considered what it's like to be in the bf's shoes?
.
Recently I've become a close confidant for a friend (A) whose partner (B) suffers from bipolar disorder and depression, and B's disorders are pretty severe. B MUST be around A all the time (I am not exaggerating), and if A is not physically present (bc of class etc), A must continue to be available for B via text, or have a legit reason whereby A cannot use his/her phone (eg exam). After which, A must immediately account back to B to assure B that he/she is not leaving her/him. B also sends A to A's classes, so that they will spend maximum time tgt. To make matters worse, they live together (in hall), so A can't simply lie that he/she is in his/her room when he/she has been going out elsewhere. Why? Because to B, there are only 2 scenarios: A wants me, or A doesn't want me (and hence A chooses other things like listening to lessons or going out with friends, over spending time with me). 
.
I've advised A that it is a seriously toxic relationship. B has become so dependent on A, that whenever A ""disappears"", B does sth rash like cutting him/herself, or threatening to commit suicide.
.
Can you imagine being in the shoes of A? Yes, B needs help, and we offer him/her our sympathy, but who are we to judge A for being a ""bad partner"" bc he/she needs his/her alone time and to have somebody rely on you 24/7 is absolutely mentally taxing? How would you feel if every little action of that you do can potentially cause someone to take their life?
.
A has ever confided to me that he/she has contemplated just letting B take his/her life, because A really cannot deal with the amount of stress B is causing for A. A acknowledged that it is a selfish act, but there are limits to people.
.
So maybe I can't offer a solution to A's and B's problems. But PLEASE be more mindful of the words that you type and speak. You never know what others are going through. 

TLDR: You shouldn't judge the bf so quickly without even knowing his side of the story

(And for those who are curious, B is already seeking treatment for the disorders, but it is not helping.)"

4695,54653,"Having been studying in NUS bizad for several years, I can safely come to a conclusion that the school I am in is filled with pragmatic, conceited and condescending human beings. 

This is generalisation - but most Finance students I talk to signal the characteristics  I mentioned above. Talk to them about JP Morgan, Citi, Goldman, Credit Suisse and you can see their mouth watering. Divert the conversation to none of these banks and they would not give you any attention. 

Me: “I would love to work in *name of company*. They were recently acquired by  the Tencent! It is gonna be an exciting future for them.”

Finance guy: “Sorry dude. I’m not interested. The pay is shit right? Eh you know I pass the Morgan Stanley interview right!”. 

After talking a bit more about banking, the conversation comes to an end. 

The conversation I have with finance students is always about these career opportunites in major investment banks. That’s totally fine because that’s your interest. But it gets tiring overtime when it’s always about YOU. It’s always about high salary. It is always about the prestige that comes with it. I don’t find these important. But when I want to talk about my interests, suddenly no one bats an eye.

We need to have more diversity in school - people who can bring different values and achievements. This school is not a factory that produce cookie-cutter, homogenous products. There should be a balance between creativity and conscientiousness.

One possible reason would be Biz symplicity. The portal should be more targeted for students for their respective major. The email blast for year 1 and year 2 should provide a balance between finance, operations, entrepreneurship, marketing, hr, analytics, economics, etc. To date, the portal uploads general job posts that are mostly in the finance field. Non-finance students are bombarded by emails that are really irrelevant. This gives an impression to students that the job available out there are mostly in finance - which is not true. Many students are not interested in banks but because of fear of not being able to get a job and the stigma attached with some majors, they are succumbed in the end.

Interviews should also be conducted to gain admission. I am aware that some interviews have already been done for selected students but it should be applied to all students. This is to identify candidates who are really passionate about the respective business fields. SMU employs this method and this allows the University to have a diverse student body that has several interests. "

I know of other profs who would ask their students about their opinions on whether it's ok to extend the deadline.

Uni is competitive and I'm extremely sorry for being so competitive as well, but isn't this very unfair to a part of the students? Though life is unfair to begin with.

4723,54609,"Perspective from current year 4 NTU Math student
(Wrote it here since some may not follow NTU confession at the same time, thus not going to post on NTU confession)

1) Personal Experience
Before NS, I am offered NTU accountancy and I accepted it. After NS, I realised this is not what I want as I have enjoyed math and love how the logic in math works. Finally, did a switched to NTU math. I have 100% no regrets. Is the best choice in my life to ditch accountancy. I am now planning to go for PhD in math too.

I think there is really too much inaccurate publicity and overhyped about biz accountancy and finance. Biz school (and even computer science school) is attracting many students who actually will excel better if they have chosen other disciplines. Is really sad that some students just think of practicality and money, rather than their own aptitude and interest.

2) Value of a Math Degree
I have completed my minor in finance in NTU biz school. I can safely say that math modules are so much more fun, challenging, and mentally stimulating. Math degree will give you the tools to model any real world problems with mathematical models and sound logic. Biz school focus more on using the current financial theories develop by scientist and mathematicians, then write company financial analysis report, etc. In other words, focus of biz school is on presentation to clients, that's why biz school modules almost always have presentations as marking criteria. If you are someone who love the logical thinking in math, then degree in math is really what will help you to capitalise on your strengths in math to solve real world problems.

3) Employability
I have taken 2 internships. 1 with DSTA as data analyst intern, 1 with DSO as research intern. By the way, the internship pay and starting full time pay of these 2 organisations are well above the average. As I have interned there before, there is really a high chance of me getting employed full time with them if I want to. There are really many interesting projects that SG is currently embarking on that requires the skill sets of a math major. Especially since SG pushing for smart nation now. In fact, there is a trend that increasingly more math majors are recruited to take part in projects involving big data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. And with recent cyber attacks, there is great focus on cybersecurity and cryptography now. These are all sunrise industries. To really take advantage of this wave of 4th industrial revolution, you need a major that give you the quantitative skills and logical reasoning skills. These skills are what math majors are really good at. Don't misinterpret what biz schools sometimes say that they focus on training quantitative skills of their students. Biz school quantitative skills is simply accounting type of simple calculations, and also memorising formulae to use it to find the values etc. Is really mundane and boring for me after taking 4 finance mods, and compare against all my math modules. If you are more interested in the theories behind the formulae and want to learn how to model complex real world scenarios with advanced math, then math major will be the best choice to train you in your quantitative skills.

(4) NTU Math or NUS Math
The key difference is NTU Math put you through a common math curriculum for the first 1.5 years, so that you can get a feel of all the different types of math. This will aid you in choosing specialisation after this 1.5 years. Our 4 specialisation are pure math, applied math, statistics, business analytics. For me, initially I wanted statistics since I heard that actuarial science is a lucrative industry to go to and since I am good at math, so why not give it a go. But after taking the 1st module in statistics in the first 1.5 years of common curriculum, I realised that I am not suitable for statistics. I just can't seem to visualise how to form double and triple integrals to find probability for multi variables. Eventually, I chose applied math, as I realised during my 1st year that I like coding and computational thinking very much. My main point is a lot of times before u enter uni, u may have some perception of certain disciplines and areas of math. It is when you really start to try out each discipline in much more detail then you will realise what type of math suits you more. Thus, just be open minded in your 1st year studying math. Enjoy the fun of learning math in university, while identifying which area of math you are more interested in. I would say both NUS and NTU have really good learning environment, and math curriculum are really very similar. You are in good hands when you join either NUS math or NTU math.

Hope this helps to answer some of doubts of potential math majors! Math is fun, useful, challenging. Do something you enjoy, so you wouldn't have to dread the time you studying in uni."

To whoever that wrote this, and many like-minded friends out there, I hope what I am sharing would deter you from this unhealthy path of eating disorders.
I am a recovering anorexic patient who had an eating disorder since I was 13 years old. 
Before everything started, I was an avid swimmer who took part in many youth competitions. I enjoyed sports and being out in the sun with my friends. In my primary 6 report book my teachers wrote: “lively” “sporty” “optimistic”. I had near perfect attendance. It was a really good time for me.
Long story short, I developed an eating disorder in secondary 1 and all the above went away. 
Being anorexic, you will not be truly happy. Yes, maybe temporary satisfaction when you see your weight drop and your bones start to appear visible under your skin. But, you will never ever be skinny enough for your standards. Each time I stood in front of the mirror all I could see was “where else I could loose weight” and not how skinny I was. Almost every moment of your day will be haunted by restricting calories, exercise, and the excruciating hunger that you try so hard to resist. This cycle, once you’re in it, trust me, its not easy getting out. 
If the detrimental mental effects don’t scare you enough, let me tell you the real physical consequence of an eating disorder. 
Gastritis – Really painful stomach aches as gastric acid digests your stomach instead of food.
Gastric reflux – due to long periods of purging after meals, painful as well
Cardiomyopathy – as your heart starts to break down; feeling tired, out of breath all the time
Sadly, these are just some of the few that I can share from my own experience. Just do a quick google search, many more will pop up. Unfortunately, many of these conditions will continue to plague you even after you start eating better. 
I am writing this post because I am starting to really regret having this eating disorder now that I am in uni. Seeing all my hallmates going for training and playing in IHG really made me wish I could join them, but I can’t without gasping for air after just a few minutes of physical activity. A common cold is all that it takes to make my body shut down and send me to the ER. 
So, if you are thinking that its cool being anorexic, it’s not. Being fed with a tube down your nose is not fun. There are healthier ways to get that toned and fit body via eating right and working out. 
For those that are still battling with eating disorders, I wish you all the best. Remember, there is help, you just need to reach out. UHC maybe a good place to start.

Honestly, the replies to this post really disgusted me. How can ppl be so unsympathetic towards others, and judge others so quickly? So yes a depressed gf is likely to be portrayed as the victim, but have they considered what it's like to be in the bf's shoes?
.
Recently I've become a close confidant for a friend (A) whose partner (B) suffers from bipolar disorder and depression, and B's disorders are pretty severe. B MUST be around A all the time (I am not exaggerating), and if A is not physically present (bc of class etc), A must continue to be available for B via text, or have a legit reason whereby A cannot use his/her phone (eg exam). After which, A must immediately account back to B to assure B that he/she is not leaving her/him. B also sends A to A's classes, so that they will spend maximum time tgt. To make matters worse, they live together (in hall), so A can't simply lie that he/she is in his/her room when he/she has been going out elsewhere. Why? Because to B, there are only 2 scenarios: A wants me, or A doesn't want me (and hence A chooses other things like listening to lessons or going out with friends, over spending time with me). 
.
I've advised A that it is a seriously toxic relationship. B has become so dependent on A, that whenever A ""disappears"", B does sth rash like cutting him/herself, or threatening to commit suicide.
.
Can you imagine being in the shoes of A? Yes, B needs help, and we offer him/her our sympathy, but who are we to judge A for being a ""bad partner"" bc he/she needs his/her alone time and to have somebody rely on you 24/7 is absolutely mentally taxing? How would you feel if every little action of that you do can potentially cause someone to take their life?
.
A has ever confided to me that he/she has contemplated just letting B take his/her life, because A really cannot deal with the amount of stress B is causing for A. A acknowledged that it is a selfish act, but there are limits to people.
.
So maybe I can't offer a solution to A's and B's problems. But PLEASE be more mindful of the words that you type and speak. You never know what others are going through. 

TLDR: You shouldn't judge the bf so quickly without even knowing his side of the story

(And for those who are curious, B is already seeking treatment for the disorders, but it is not helping.)"

4756,54555,"@#54540: I can relate perfectly well to your concern. Truth to be told, I don't think there's such things as real friends anymore the more you move up in life. Especially in uni where everyone can hardly meet due to differing schedules, there's no chances to cultivate meaningful relationships. 

The only true time to cultivate real friends is during pri/sec school when everyone were naive kids who were more expressive with one another. As you move up life, people get more self-conscious. They can hide their feelings better. If they don't like you, they won't talk to you or even start gossiping about you (I mean this especially for girls...). Making real friends is nigh impossible, making 'connections' however, is possible.

In this point in life, there's only two meaningful relationships you can truly have.
One is finding a girlfriend/boyfriend, since in this kind of relationship, both parties have their fair stake in it to commit. 

The other option (which might be controversial), is to join a religious group like a Christian cell group in school. Not trying to promote or anything, but seriously, it's true. Being a religious person myself who goes to these meetings, honestly these are the only people I truly find being legit. They actually show care and concern for you instead of ostracizing whenever it's convenient.   

Sorry, but that's life. Especially in Singapore, most other people just put on fake smiles and fake laughs. This is why you gotta treasure your friendships when you get them. Because after a certain point in life, it's really...too late. "

4772,54532,"Mathematics Major in university, how worthwhile is it?
J2 here, thinking about different uni courses to apply to next year. Would love if any past math majors can tell me some of their experience as well :D.
I'm interested in Math, comp sci/stats as well but mostly math. I know CS is popular and great but I'm wondering if doing a math degree can be equally worthwhile? It may sound like a dumb question, but can studying math (pure/applied) in uni get CS jobs? I want to study math but I don't want to become a teacher, its not really my thing. Also afraid I might end up studying a bunch of theoretical mathematics (which I may want to) just for the sake of it and not find a job that uses them. Essentially, how will the majors (CS/Pure Math/App. Math/Stats) compare?

EDIT: if Math is so versatile, why is the cutoff for CS wayy higher than math?"
4773,54531,"Idk how I ended up like this.
Since I was in primary school, I've been having the problem of being ""outcasted"". Until now, in uni, I have once again felt outcasted by my peers. 
Initially, I thought that I'm just unlucky that people around me just suck. I still remember being outcasted by a group of people simply because one girl disliked me and somehow she convinced others to stay away from me.
I also remember back in JC, some people in my OG also formed their own clique and excluded me. I was quite disappointed then as I had been making efforts to stay close to them.
Now in uni, I realised that some ppl in my OG have been going out together and the OG WA group was dead for quite some time. So I thought probably they had created a WA group and I happen to be not inside. Idk what I have done wrong. I went to lectures with them and lunch afterwards and also stayed back to study with them. 
I do not have any clique of friends to go around with so I have been making efforts to keep close to them. 
I even reflected upon myself but I still couldn't figure out what's the problem. Everyone's impression of me is like ""outgoing"", ""bubbly"", ""sociable"" and some people probably think I'm ""popz"". So I really don't know why I just can't find a group of friends whom I can hang around with. 
I'm kind of becoming depressed as I kind of have no friends and no life now. SEND HELP.

4774,54530,"Currently I accepted SMU School of Accountancy's offer to enroll in class of 2020. Rejected NTU's Accountancy because thought once (true story) went for this talk conducted by NBS during their open house. They invited an distinguished Alumnus back to share her experience. Must say that she wasn't really much of a speaker and was unable to captivate the crowds. Was very displeased by my experience with NTU. 

I also am currently holding an office post in NS, and found myself dislike working like a horse/cow/computer/dog (yeah you get the idea) on the desk doing repetitive stuff (doing a lot of write-ups, email, data-entry). 

I have a keen interest in Math, not just solving problems, but also proving. Took H3 Math for A levels and must say, though can be discouraging at times, the joy you get from proving a given statement is FANTASTIC!!! 

Okay now, back to the present, I have a University course crisis. Of course I know Accountancy earns you good money, but I want to learn Math for the sake of learning Math (mostly satisfaction from mental vigor). I dont know whether if I will excel further in the pursuit of studying Math in Uni, but would like to get at least a Masters (for bragging). I understand that most Accountancy Grads work like a horse/cow/server/dog at their peak, and personally, after working at a desk job, really find it unsatisfying, though heard in the long term, money is fantastic (and no one really studies till Masters for Accountancy)

My Grades are AAAB/E (e for excellent) H3 Math, Distinction 

If TL;DR, my questions are:

1. What are the career choices (kindly state agencies too) one can have being a Math Major? And of course, estimated salary?

2. Differences between NTU and NUS Math programs?

3. What to expect in the years to come if I study Math (personally may want to focus on Pure Math than other branches of Math)?

4. Should I change my course from Accountancy to Math if I dislike doing repetitive stuff or working on a tight deadline?

so, i have decided to move on but i am afraid that i may hurt someone in the future. if i were to start out something with someone else and this stupid guy decide to chase me again, i might leave with him. i hate myself from thinking in this manner, but somehow i don't trust myself to commit with anyone else. i don't know how do people move on from different relationships and don't look back at all, it really amazes me. i need help badly...

4789,54495,"Storytime!
So I have this friend whom I thought I was pretty close with. Did our internship at the same company. Could click pretty ok. Then, new semester, we took the same mod. I usually got the concepts a little faster and would tell him what to focus on and explain how it works. Even when weekly assignments came out, when I found the answer, I would share it cos he is a good friend. Slowly he didnt even come to tutorials at all, but i went anyways and still update him on some important stuff that happens. So recently I felt very one sided and indignant that he plays so much computer games and still can complete assignments on time because I have already figured out most of the shit for him. Even during midterms, I was particularly stressed out so i got a lower score than him. Then, when I went for tutorial, tutor gave an explicit answer to how to solve the problem for that week. I took it but didnt share with said friend. I was indignant and thought that maybe this was where it should stop. So I (criticise me all you like) became a fake friend and lied that i also dont know how to complete the assignment when I already submitted it. Even near the deadline, he tried to check on my progress to see if I got an answer, probably so he can copy it, but I told him I gave up. So the deadline passed. I asked if he knew how to do, and he said he got a mutual friend who got a model answer from another person. And even when he knew how to do it, he didnt think of me. Should I be outright angry at him for not thinking of me as a friend or just pretend to be friends and take revenge at the critical moment?

Thing is, I know for sure I will not go into research again as I know from my FYP that research is really not for me. Furthermore, I had a rather nightmarish experience with my FYP, which further convince me that research is not a viable choice for my long term career.

On the other hand, some medical technologist posts did offer me an interview, questioning me on why I would choose this job when I have a FCH. The short answer is because I believe I will have passion for clinical type of jobs. 

I did not get any medical technologist jobs till now and  from what people around had been telling me, it seems like a FCH is over-qualified for the job. Is this really the case? For my expected salary, I only stated the average pay for fresh grad, which is around $3k.

Instead of sending application to a lot of companies, I chose to send to maximum of 2 at the same time. And it's the 2 that I really want.for both companies, I sent very different resume and write up because I wanted to customise to their organisation goal. I told myself to ""only move on to the next one when they reject"". So I waited. I also had intentions go call if I don't receive any emails or calls.

I received a call about 2 weeks later for first interview scheduled 2 weeks from the call. I went there, applied for a position thats not my area of studies. Throughout the interview, rather than giving pre prepared answers, I gave extremely honest answers and show them my true self. I didn't over promise or over sell myself. I was quite scared because they told me there's 200 over applicants for the positions available. 

1 week later, I received a call for second interview scheduled 3 weeks later. This time is to meet the bigger boss asking more of knowing me questions. Same thing, I tried to be real all the time and say things like ""I never thought about it but I'll try to answer"". I told them I'm a little nervous but I'm trying my best. I'm at least 99.99% being the real me during interview. 

2 days after the second interview, I got the offer. 

During this period, I did not submit anymore application and waited for the one I really wanted. I told myself to wait for rejection before I move on as I don't want to face the situation of rejecting another company which sees potential in me. I also was really frank with them about how many jobs I applied. I didn't show that I was desperate as well.

4815,54447,"I am really really really not a troll, I am just an NUS graduate living with a serious problem that has followed me since childhood. Why? Why me? What did I do wrong?

I have graduated from NUS, and my whole life is coloured with confusion, pain and hurt. Please be patient with me, and read my history of unfortunate events. 

Problem 1: 
I am still a bit sure that I have friends, but I just don't have whatsapp and telegram group chats that flood with a continuous stream of messages. Every time I check my phone, it is blank and empty. I really do not know why, and how, the whatsapp groups of everyone else light up like a christmas tree with a never ending barrage of messages from everyone. 

I have group chats, but none of them are THAT active. 

All it takes is 2 people who chat among themselves in the group, and all the other 18 in the same group can get 100 messages without having to do anything. Right??? That sounds easy, but why is this never happening to me? Why is my phone empty? 

Problem 2:
Secondly, I get invited to all sorts of events, but not weddings and proposals. I have been to birthday parties, museum trips, overseas trips and of course the weekly lunch catch ups but not any weddings! I am trying not to be paranoid, but this is a huge red flag, because my whole Instagram is flooded with my peers attending different weddings every week. 

Every weekend, while they somehow manage to get all the elusive invites to wedding after wedding, and I am just out of the loop. I have never received any one wedding invite, because can you believe it, none of my friends are getting married! They are all single and finding a partner. 

But still, how come at this age, I still have not been to a crucial experience of humanity? I am seriously missing out on life. I have never been part of any bridal hen's night either, and I have never been a bridesmaid either. 

If you don't believe a person can get THIS unlucky, look at me. I am the unlucky one. 

Problem 3:
If you think weird things with a probability of less than 5% (such as no wedding invites) happen to me after graduation, please check out yet another puzzling issue that has followed me for FOUR YEARS AT NUS and TWO MORE YEARS IN JC consistently, like a creepy shadow. 

I have never understood, or experienced in person, what it means to be ""overwhelmed"" by work. I only have 30 hours of lessons per week. 24 times 7 is 168 hours, and only 30 hours are for school lessons, so what do I do with the remaining 138 hours? 

But other people with 30 hours (same?) of lessons say that they are so busy and so overworked that they cannot handle the ""stress"". How come everyone life is so busy with (dunno what??) tasks of which I never heard of? dont we have the same lessons? What are the normal popular cool kids doing with their 138 hours that they feel so stressed about? 

In JC, I took 4 subjects and General Paper. Everyone has the same time table, but I was the only one with so much empty space in between? I end class at 2pm, and spent all my after school hours wandering around shopping centres and scrolling Instagram and snapchat until my bedtime.........because if you look at my time table (which ends at 2pm) there is REALLY. NOTHING. TO. DO. 

I don't understand why in JC all my peers say they are ""busy"", ""tired"" (from?) and ""overwhelmed"". We end class at the same time of 2pm. When I am wandering around aimlessly, what is the ""mystery activity"" that my peers are all doing?!

Problem 5: (the consistent problem):

With wedding invites flying around like daggers, how can I still not receive any? 
With group notifications flooding around like a dam, why is my phone still so empty? 
With a certain ""mystery activity"" passed on like wildfire, how come I dunno what to do with the extra 138 hours in NUS, and how come in JC I got nothing to do after 2 pm?

Hey there! Here are a few other options that you may consider besides the ones that have been suggested in the previous post: 

1. Mid-term scholarships
2. CPF loan 
3. Approaching the financial aid office at utown to see if they're able to assist you further

4. Taking up a few highly paid part-time jobs like tuition. If you have 5-6 tuition kids at around $50/week each, that will be approximately $1k a month. By hustling more during the holidays, you should be able to foot the school fees on time and have some leftover to spend on food and entertainment

5. Taking LOA for 1-2 semesters and working full time during this period to save up. Do note that there'll be a penalty on school fees should you exceed the normal candidature though, hence overloading will be required for this option 

I personally know of someone who is paying for their own school + hostel fees, and living expenses in this manner by method 4 so it's possible and you wouldn't be alone on this arduous journey. It will be good if you currently have some buffer in your bank account, otherwise I'd personally recommend a combi of 4 & 5, after utilising option 3. Good luck and all the best.

4860,54367,"Heyyy plastic straw lovers!
 
- The top waste disposed in Singapore 2017 was Plastics (NEA, 2017) at 763,400 out of 2,980,000 tonnes, or 25.6% (1 d.p.).
- Singapore's (only) landfill - Pulau Semakau - has an expiry date of 2035, which has already been brought forward by 10 years from the original 2045. 2035 is 17 years away.
- Singapore's National Recycling Program recycled 2% of total household waste in 2017.
- Singapore ranks 26 out of 142 countries in emissions per capita.
 
We have done great so far! What?
 
Many of you have correctly pointed out that Singapore and plastic straws (by sheer size), is barely responsible for marine pollution; that marine pollution is a result of irresponsible behaviour i.e. littering.  
 
The statistics I shared above are nothing about marine pollution and littering per se. It's about Singapore's/ our individual waste-line. As future tax payers, our wallet$ are also on the line to pay for waste management, reinforce infrastructure to mitigate rising sea levels etc. You and I, are in the picture.
 
The new policy on straws is not meant to be indiscriminate. Simply, instead of a 'opt out' model, it's now 'opt in'. If you need a straw or anything for medical/ personal reasons, please go for it - you are respected and paper straws are available on request.
 
The administration has (unknowingly) created a golden opportunity for the vibrant sharing and exchanging of perspectives - more people than ever are researching enthusiastically, sharing their findings publicly and engaging respectfully about the topic of waste and pollution in Singapore and globally on campus. Better than any compulsory module has done for collective intellectual discourse...I exaggerate. Thanks for shaking up the status quo and allowing ALL of us to be part of the active learning process to slim our waste-line. Plastic straws, as pervasive and dear to our hearts, is only the tip of the wa$teberg.
 
Earth Overshoot Day was 1/August/2018. Since 2/August/2018, we have been living on Earth's 2019 budget for plastic straws. If you ask me, what is sustainability? It's the ability to sustain life on Earth with what Earth has. (Has anyone researched on this too..??? My turn to class part) If through this policy we can push next year's Earth Overshoot Day by a second, that counts tremendously.

4871,54354,"#54309: My reaction to #54205 and its comments are quite different though. Many seem quite insistent that girls should be allowed to wear what they want, which must be right of course - it's their bodies; some (if not many) guys like to look; the girls know it; they're happy to flaunt; I don't see the problem.

My question is why guys do not have such freedom in dressing, and will those (especially the women) who are adamantly saying ""let her wear what she wants"", similarly defend a guy walking around in briefs?

Our society now seems to be such that girls can walk around in shorts that, as the OP put it, are little more than underwear - which is great from a straight guy's point of view, of course XD but can you imagine what would happen if a guy tried to do the same? Methinks he'd be lucky not to spend the night in a lockup. If we are happy to assume that a girl dresses like that ""for herself and not for anyone else"", why can't a guy walk around similarly skimpily clothed just because he feels like it? How many of you defending the girl's freedom would similarly tell those who are ""offended"" by a guy walking around in briefs to ""just look elsewhere""?

On a broader point, women in this society have so much freedom to dress as lightly or as provocatively as they want, which I repeat is great. But men are stuck with the same boring and warm clothing regardless of the weather and the wearer's mood. A woman who dresses like a man for business purposes is called confident but a man who dons women's clothing is ridiculed and told to ""man up"". What does this tell you about how we subconsciously view the relative status of the two genders, even if we froth at the mouth with politically-correct statements?

As a guy who used to live alone, I have worn dresses and robes and they are seriously more breezy and comfy than the boring old trousers that every boy grows up with no alternative to. This doesn't make me want to be a woman - I'm perfectly happy with my assigned gender but I just feel if you want to talk about women's freedom to ""wear whatever they want"" and not be a hypocrite, then make sure you genuinely defend men's freedom to walk around in what they want as well. Even if it's a translucent dress with briefs underneath."

To make a true impact, plastic bags and takeaway boxes should be banned, and the use of private vehicles disincentivised.""

If you dedicate three long paragraphs to talking about the lack of straws is a massive inconvenience, how am I supposed to believe that you would support wider green initiatives that inconvenience you even more? I'm sorry, but I don't buy it. 

Btw you don't need corporations to compel you to go green for bags and boxes and transport. But if you are the kind of person who throws a huge tantrum over how horrible the lack of plastic straws is, I highly doubt you are going green in other areas in your life.

However, I personally favor initiatives that compel people to be eco-friendly, not ""we can do it ourselves, we shouldn't have the government or companies forcing us"". Why? Because it is blatantly obvious that most people have a mindset of ""if you want to go green, that's your business, it's none of my business, and I will resist every attempt to make me personally go green"", so a laissez-faire approach would never work. Without policy, the vast majority would never go green in any way."

4906,54303,"
Sometimes I have these relapses where I just get really lonely but I feel I have no one to turn to. I have friends but at most they're quite superficial, like not really that close or anything. Sometimes I think it's just insta screwing me and making me feel bad about my state of mind and such.

I kind of always wanted a gf but I'm just too scared to take the leap. I'm scared to ask people out for like meals or to hang out because of fear that they're too busy or that I'm desperate. (esp for girls) Like it's also really subconscious for me, but I tend to avoid eye contact and interact with pretty girls because I don't feel I deserve to know them or be their friend. Like for me, I just really want to spend time knowing people and just hanging out (and I have the time to) but I'm just too scared to initiate.

It sometimes really confuses me how my mind works. But I just feel that SG is just this really conservative place and everyone is more worried about grades and careers rather than meaningful relationships. And I've just kind of put myself into that position (or dug a hole) where I basically am really desperate to get to know people, to become closer and to have the kind of social life ordinary uni people have. But that in doing so, I'll just start turning people off and breaking the relationships that I want to create.

What should I do?"

4908,54301,"Hi all, i'm at an important crossroad and i really need some advice right now. A few months ago, i've started a personal trading portfolio for supplement income to pay my tuition/expenses. Ofc this wasn't entirely a smooth ride, but my rate of returns has stabilized over time. Overall, swing trading has proven to be much more profitable than i expected. I've kept a record of all my trade alerts, transactions and analysis, including some videos that details my thought process on the charts. Recently, I'm started to pool capital from relatives(ofc i do pay them a risk premium) since i now feel more confident with handling larger position sizes.

I understand that trading is highly speculative and has little to do with any one particular academic disciplines. I'm really interested in this field, but I've got no economic background apart from *lol* H2 econs. My major has little to do with macro-economics. Recently, I've started creating an algo-based trade-alert generator/logger based on whatever little i've learnt in my foundation mods, and i'm eager to receive insights from certified experts so that i can eventually develop it into a functional app. Does anyone know of courses or modules in nus that delves into trading or managing hedge funds? And for those who are working in the industry, apart from my personal portfolio, what sort of formal qualifications or experience do i need to secure an internship. Thanks"

There are some really annoying things about the way people conduct themselves, though. 

Firstly, a majority of people (not all) walk incredibly slow, and do not seem to be aware of their surroundings. If someone is approaching from in front of you, and you and your friends are taking up the entire width of the pavement, then you need to make space. 

Holding doors open. I’ve noticed quite a few people not holding the door open for the person behind them. On a few occasions I’ve had the door slam in my face despite someone only being half a metre ahead of me. Come on, it doesn’t take any time to keep the door open for the person behind you. 

Another post from last night alluded to people not taking their bags off on buses. A few responses claimed not to understand the fuss stating that the same area is taken up on the bus. That is not the point, the point is that you have less control/awareness of a bag on your back. If you hold it in front of you then you’ll be able to be a little more courteous to fellow passengers. 

Singapore is an amazing place. I am grateful for getting the opportunity to study here. These are just a few of the daily inconveniences I face as an exchange student. "
4911,54298,"To the poly and jc kids things, I'm someone who works with both poly and jc kids as part of my job for past 5 years in non academic setting but still in university setting. My key observation is that JC kids seems to be those ""law by law"" kind while poly kids are not - not in a bad way, some tend to be creative to find solution.

When I see both poly and jc kids working, I enjoy it when I see them bringing out the best of each other and bring their experience to table openly, without bothering where they came from (some came through ITE route too!) . 

There's no such thing as who is smarter or not because everyone is still trying to reach the ultimate objectives and goals they have set. 

Jc kids who didn't go through Poly education doesn't mean they suck at doing projects, it's just their education system didn't have much of that opportunities. Same for the opposite, poly kids who didn't go through JC education system doesnt mean they can't write well because they dont do GP, it's their education system that focuses on something else. All these are applicable to anyone and everyone who comes from different education path. It is up to an individual to take these as transferable skills and apply it to different situations, and more importantly share these important skills with your fellow friends and project mates since all of you are now in the same education system.  

Therefore, instead of feeling like ""all JC kids are like this"" or ""all poly kids are like this"", you should focus on that individual who made you feel that way, communicate with him or her in order to work out the difference you guys have.

4915,54292,"#54261: Well, there are multiple steps for me.

First is the realisation and me forcing myself to see the reality that the porn industry treat people (its actresses) like shit. Everytime I watch one of those, I send a signal to the market that this is the thing that interest people and they should continue to make porn like it. My action is but a drop in a bucket but I want to keep my conscience clear.

The second thing I did is I found out am less interested in the actual sex depicted in porn, but rather the story of people, that occasionally involve sex. Thus, I seek out ""less harmful to the actors and actresses type of porn"". Meaning amateurs. I wish to think/believe that those porns, while being lower in production quality, represent someone's real sex lives where sex is a natural part of their daily lives. 

The third thing is: don't just watch porn. Watch something with a plot which happens to have sex in it, and try to analyse the story. I took a couple of mods in film study and have been applying it to even the most mundane stuff I watch. If you are afraid of porn numbing your brains: get your brain active while watching porn by looking for plots with porn (not porns with plot).

The best source for such, for me, is Japanese hentai manga. It does the trick for me: highly arousing, occasionally have great, heart warming stories, ""victimless"" (one lone crazy nutter drawing all the stuff), support creative endeavours (wait ... I am a pirate; OK, appreciate creative endeavors), filling-in-the-blanks-for-series-with-disappointing endings. Then there are super sad hentai manga that make you give you depression (the most confused arousal time possible). For example: Metamorphosis/Emergence/177013.

Switch it up. Manga is great. Including the porn variety.

Caveat: I do all of this while being attached (previously) or married (now), so I have a steady, stable sex life and am satisfied sexually, for the most part. The hentai stuff is for me to connect with the weirder possible desires that simply cannot get in my sex life. There are so many good things in my married life that I don't want to trade for potentially crazy sex so hentai is an discovery trip."

His girlfriend is so much better than me, she's attractive and athletic, I'm pretty sure smarter than me since she's from a better JC than I am, and even her figure is so much better? Like, she's got some really large assets... Kind of jealous on that point since I'm pretty much a runway.

Just because someone supports the straw ban doesn't mean that they have to become shamans or hermits and go 100% green or risk being called a hypocrite otherwise. Since when was environmental consciousness a 100% yes/no concept? 

Indeed the whole sensationalism and fixation on straws is partly due to the turtle images which can be attributed to improper disposal, but if you can't be bothered to put in that little bit of effort to use less straws, what makes you think you'll be willing to cut back on the more severe things that harm the environment? Right, because ""I'm just one person, it doesn't make a difference"", and ""other countries pollute more so it doesn't matter anyway"", and definitely not because you are lazy, apathetic and can't live with less convenience.

Sure, this whole straw ban isn't going to do much to reduce waste directly, but it forces you to think about what is going on, and quite evidently has highlighted the apathy people have here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

4942,54241,"Am a person on the fence, but I think almost everybody can agree that the ireject campaign has been handled badly - the transition was abrupt, very little effort was put into justifying the change or even in communicating about it, and as a result, quite a bit of the response towards it has been quite negative. People against the ban are correct in pointing out that not using straws probably won't have a significant impact on the environment (not even on a personal level, when comparing straws to other things like driving). The real question is whether the ireject campaign (and similar ones) can lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour which might then have a clear and significant impact on the environment- for example, phasing out plastics entirely in the future, or at least reducing waste by a significant amount.

To that question, I don't think there's a clear answer yet; research tends to find conflicting results: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014001599 - you can access this through lib.nus if you feel so inclined) There is a possibility that these campaigns will lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour, but it might also have the adverse effect  (make you feel like you've done your good deed for the day for the environment, so you can afford to be a bit more wasteful later). And, of course, this will also impact the way that future campaigns are received. 

What I don't think is controversial at all is that there are definitely things that everybody should do to reduce their impact on the environment- and that those things go beyond not using straws. 

If you are happy to let go of plastic straws, that's great! But being smug and self-righteous about it may actually turn people away from being environmentally friendly (look at #54203 for example - just terrible). If you think that the ireject campaign was poorly executed, I agree completely - the NUS administration should at least do more in terms of communication and dialogue before embarking on such a large scale ban. And if you'd rather not deal with the inconvenience of letting go of something that doesn't make that much of an impact, that's fine too - but put your money where your mouth is and do other things that you believe will have a greater impact on reducing your personal environmental costs - try to eat less meat, use public transport more, buy less things in general, recycle more, etc - and don't stop there!"

If the thought of looking after kids is so repulsive to you, won't it be the same even if you have a kid though adoption/surrogacy? All the sacrifices you will have to make still applies although he is not your own flesh and blood.

If you are not able to change your own mindset on this issue, please do not agree to have kids as you may regret this decision in the future.

I tried to see things from another pov, but I know that I will really hate myself if I have a kid just because its a norm.

I have been happily attached to my girl for quite a long time.Basically I have done alot for her. 

I gave up my further studies in the States , broke up with my cliche of male friends(Those Eat Drink Make Merry kind), fell out with my loved ones, all was done for her.

I do not expect her to return my favour because I have always thought sacrifices are inevitable to maintain a good relationship with your SO. 

However the day came when I was hit with the cold hard truth. I caught her cheating on me while reading her text message. It was a conversation with some foreign guy. She has been exchanging lovey dovey texts with that scum. Not just that, she has also been planning to cheat me of my money via the joint account I had with her. That moment was really a bolt out of the blue.

To my bros out there, do not be over desperate for a girlfriend. You never know when she can become a timebomb. Do not let a girl become your weakness. Focus on your relationship with your family instead and work on personal goals. Do not give up what you have achieved.

4971,54205,"#54309: My reaction to #54205 and its comments are quite different though. Many seem quite insistent that girls should be allowed to wear what they want, which must be right of course - it's their bodies; some (if not many) guys like to look; the girls know it; they're happy to flaunt; I don't see the problem.

My question is why guys do not have such freedom in dressing, and will those (especially the women) who are adamantly saying ""let her wear what she wants"", similarly defend a guy walking around in briefs?

Our society now seems to be such that girls can walk around in shorts that, as the OP put it, are little more than underwear - which is great from a straight guy's point of view, of course XD but can you imagine what would happen if a guy tried to do the same? Methinks he'd be lucky not to spend the night in a lockup. If we are happy to assume that a girl dresses like that ""for herself and not for anyone else"", why can't a guy walk around similarly skimpily clothed just because he feels like it? How many of you defending the girl's freedom would similarly tell those who are ""offended"" by a guy walking around in briefs to ""just look elsewhere""?

On a broader point, women in this society have so much freedom to dress as lightly or as provocatively as they want, which I repeat is great. But men are stuck with the same boring and warm clothing regardless of the weather and the wearer's mood. A woman who dresses like a man for business purposes is called confident but a man who dons women's clothing is ridiculed and told to ""man up"". What does this tell you about how we subconsciously view the relative status of the two genders, even if we froth at the mouth with politically-correct statements?

As a guy who used to live alone, I have worn dresses and robes and they are seriously more breezy and comfy than the boring old trousers that every boy grows up with no alternative to. This doesn't make me want to be a woman - I'm perfectly happy with my assigned gender but I just feel if you want to talk about women's freedom to ""wear whatever they want"" and not be a hypocrite, then make sure you genuinely defend men's freedom to walk around in what they want as well. Even if it's a translucent dress with briefs underneath."

4973,54203,"Am a person on the fence, but I think almost everybody can agree that the ireject campaign has been handled badly - the transition was abrupt, very little effort was put into justifying the change or even in communicating about it, and as a result, quite a bit of the response towards it has been quite negative. People against the ban are correct in pointing out that not using straws probably won't have a significant impact on the environment (not even on a personal level, when comparing straws to other things like driving). The real question is whether the ireject campaign (and similar ones) can lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour which might then have a clear and significant impact on the environment- for example, phasing out plastics entirely in the future, or at least reducing waste by a significant amount.

To that question, I don't think there's a clear answer yet; research tends to find conflicting results: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014001599 - you can access this through lib.nus if you feel so inclined) There is a possibility that these campaigns will lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour, but it might also have the adverse effect  (make you feel like you've done your good deed for the day for the environment, so you can afford to be a bit more wasteful later). And, of course, this will also impact the way that future campaigns are received. 

What I don't think is controversial at all is that there are definitely things that everybody should do to reduce their impact on the environment- and that those things go beyond not using straws. 

If you are happy to let go of plastic straws, that's great! But being smug and self-righteous about it may actually turn people away from being environmentally friendly (look at #54203 for example - just terrible). If you think that the ireject campaign was poorly executed, I agree completely - the NUS administration should at least do more in terms of communication and dialogue before embarking on such a large scale ban.

4975,54201,"I feel really lost and like my life is at a dead end. I'm not suicidal per se in the sense that I actively want to die, but I don't actively want to live either. 

My parents just got into another massive argument again. This isn't anything new, I've been used to it my whole life as long as I can remember. The difference now is that I have no 'safe/happy place' anymore.

From primary school till JC I loved the schools I was in and had friends and even teachers I could talk to to take my mind off the problems at home. I loved my classes and CCAs and would spend as much as possible in school before going home, and that generally helped me forget, at least for a little while, the hell I had waiting for me back at home. 

But that's not the case anymore. Don't get me wrong, I know I am very fortunate and privileged to have gotten into the course I am in- everyone always tells me that. Only problem is I hate it. My parents very kindly took a break from their incessant fighting to 'persuade' (read: force) me to enter my course because of the 'prestige' of the course (and NUS in general) and that it has good career prospects in the future. My passion is actually for a less conventionally prestigious course offered in one of the other local unis (they have sub-specialisations not offered in NUS), but my parents scoffed in my face when I told them. 

So now I'm not just living in an unhappy home but also in an unhappy school environment I'm stuck in for a few more years. There's nowhere I can go to have a peace of mind, and since most of my friends from grade school are busy in other courses/unis, I have nobody to turn to either.

From other posts I've read here, it seems the UHC counselling isn't much help and I can't go to a private one because my parents control my money (even the little I've earned from part-time work/internships because they claim I'm not 21 yet so still a minor who shouldn't be given the responsibility) so I'm really helpless.

After travelling to so many nearby tropical countries, it is very obvious that our air conditioning temperatures are much colder. If you walk into a random classroom in campus, chances are the A/C are running even if it is vacant. If we were to turn up the indoor air conditioning temperature from the current chilly 21/22 deg c (where people are often observed dress in sweaters or winter clothes) to a reasonable 24/25 dec c, it is way more effective. Banning all plastic straws globally at once will make negligible effects on the amount of emissions, turning up indoor temperatures in Singapore is going to make a huge impact globally. Imagine the amount of CO2 being cut down from lower electrical consumption. and if you factor in the lower amount of waste heat released into the environment which in turn reduce the amount of air conditioning needed.

My family has a lot of issues with finance and that really puts a lot of stress on me to work part time and study, as well as my course which is ""prestigious"" and has a really heavy workload. A lot of times I feel like we should break up simply because I'm not good enough. 

I do try my best to be a good girlfriend, like I will treat him to food sometimes (he insists on treating me food all the time, but I always insist we go on Dutch.), and I will play video games with him, and I just really want to be a good match for him, but I'm not. 

I'm ridden with mental illnesses, and I cry at least once a day while he takes time out of his busy schedule to comfort me.

I just don't see what's good enough about me, (I don't think I'm very pretty) and I do want to suggest breaking up just so that he gets someone better than I am. Physically wise, I also have asthma and I get unwell easily, so he will drop his schedule just to take care of me and sit by my bed until I fall asleep, without asking for anything in return. He's always there for me, no matter how tired he is. 

I am trying to work on my depression and anxiety and get better for his sake, but it's just so hard to get up in the morning. Sometimes I don't tell him when I'm sad, because I know he will get really worried about me.

I admit though, I'm kind of like a half-retard that can't keep up with conversations so I've never been good at socialising. But it's also that and a slew of bad decisions I made, one of which was coming to NUS in the first place.


I really regret not applying for any hall or RC but I guess none will likely accept me anyway, unlike NTU where it's confirmed you'll get a slot. I really wanted to live a vibrant campus life living alongside fellow schoolmates but hey, my achievement record sucks, so I guess I'm not qualified enough for this 'vibrant campus life' in NUS. 
Even if I applied next sem/next year for hall/RC, what does it matter?


Meanwhile I joined tried joining different CCAs, one of which hardly meets at all and is practically non-existent to me.  

Groupmates are just hi-bye friends and relationships just slowly strain away when they see how incredibly stupid I am and how stupid I speak.

Classmates shun me since I act like a half-brained idiot and constantly screw up in class and what friends I try to make never really become friends.

 While these people can talk and laugh with each other, when they speak to me, it's always in some formal tone like speaking to a stranger. Not one person has ever treated me more than that apart from my family. Never in my life. That's who I ever am to everyone. 10 weeks later and still treated like a 'stranger' by everyone.
 
It's been years but I'm used to it by now so no, I'm not depressed. I'm literally immune to depression at this point. Funny, huh? To those of you struggling with loneliness too, don't worry, you'll become immune to depression eventually. You won't feel that heartache that much anymore.

Sure, the campaign was executed poorly. But aren't we all cockroaches who make do whenever top-down decisions are imposed on us?

There are bigger factors that are contributing to waste, but do you think you are the only one, so minor that it validates your daily contribution to unnecessary waste? Well, says the rest of the world. Straws are just a tiny part of the problem? Take 10 million of them and I'll see how you can shove them up your pampered a$$.

How about we stop making excuses, and make some effort to create a little less waste? No one is telling you never to use straws or plastics, but a reduction of even 10% of your wastage can slow down the speed at which waste is occupying space.

4996,54169,"I don't know if I'm depressed or not.

I'm not suicidal or anything, but some of the symptoms I could relate to. Sometimes I can't pull myself out of bed, I don't have motivation to do work and I don't find much joy in drawing which used to be my hobby. I attributed it to me being lazy and procrastinating. Just recently, I got scolded quite badly by my tutor during consultation for shoddy work and not emailing him when I skipped the previous lesson. I guess it goes to shows that he cares but I was trying very hard not to break down and cry in front of him and some of my peers that also came for consultation.

I know it's my fault. I deserved being told off because I didn't do my work properly. But I don't know if I should blame my laziness or depression. I don't want to make light of depression. I'm scared of going to get professional help to find out at the end of the day I'm not depressed, I'm just lazy. 

Is there any other way I can deal with this?"
4997,54167,"I am a student in NUS. I was having a fever on the afternoon of 26 October 2018, Friday. I took some medication but still felt unwell. As such I decided to go to the clinic at University Health Centre. However, I was met with rude staff who were extremely unpleasant.


Knowing that I will be reaching at about 5pm, I called beforehand to ask if I could register through the phone call first. However, that did not work. Despite so, I was understanding and understood that registration could only be done at the counter. Do note that I only called once. 

When I reached, the doors were about to be locked. However, the reception was closed. Since I was there already, I just went to ask and check if I could still register. 


At the reception were two female staff. One had  black straight hair in a bob hairstyle. The other staff was quite plump, and was wearing spectacles. 


I told them that I felt feverish. They then told me to measure my temperature. As I was doing so, they spoke in dialects, thinking that I would not hear or understand them. They said that I was rude to barge in when they were closing. The staff with spectacles even told the other staff that I called 10 times beforehand! And all this commotion was happening just right in front of me! I was shocked that I was faced with such rudeness. They were not even being discrete that they were talking about me.


The thermometer then showed that my fever had gone done, because of the medication that I had took earlier. The staff then mocked me for creating a mountain out of a molehill when I was totally fine.


I am shocked that the clinic had such rude staff who told lies and gossiped about patients. In addition, the gossip was done right in front of the patients! Being a clinic in a prestigious university, I had expected the staff to be properly trained and well-mannered. It was definitely appalling and disappointing."

In many of the narratives I have read here, it seems that the OP actually has certain expectations about life and being in uni that can't be met. This is causing him/her distress. 

A tough eduation and hard time is necessary for growth. We should accept that, learn to improve and give ourselves a chance to be better with every day. On the other hand, it is our stubbon expectations of what we think life should be like that give us sadness and depression. 

Many of us are not clinically depressed but wallow in our own sadness. Even for the clinically depressed, trigger points can be identified and the knowldege that it is our self-defined unmet expectations that is significantly contributing to our mental crunch. "
5005,54152,"The ongoing ireject (straws) campaign is nothing more than a bunch of self-righteous environmental activists forcifully imposing their will on the vast majority of the population while ignoring the inconvenience they may bring to the population. Don’t get me wrong, I do think that we should reduce waste generation, but the sudden abolishment of the use of straws throughout campus has caused nothing but inconvenience.

At the present state, the stalls are just not ready to stop the provision of straws, especially for takeways. If we are ordering a drink while dining in, I agree that we could omit the use of straws. But for taking away, the cups used are simply not convenient by themselves, especially if we want to carry the drinks around (say on a bus) or drink on the go. Provision of lids would solve the problem if I want to dabao a drink back for say a class, but it would just be useless trash if I decide to drink on the go (since I don’t have straws in the first place, I have to remove the lid in order to drink). There are drinks out there that are packaged in a way that is “takeaway-friendly”, e.g. macchiato from Koi.

I just don’t think we are ready for this movement of rejecting straws (and lids) for takeaways until we can rectify this problem. Even for dining in, I do not think that people should be deprived of the option of having straws. Of course, any environmentally conscious person should not use straws unnecessarily, but the stalls should at least be able to provide straws for those who request for it, perhaps with a nominal charge."

Friendships and international relationships are pretty similar in principles. One at individual scale, one at a larger scale.
But always remember microscale is really the basis of larger scale. ie our human characteristics collectively determine international relationships. 

The two basic principle for all things are:

1) The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.
2) There are no permanent friends only permanent interest.

they are nice to you coz you have something to offer. they are stronger than you (more popular), but want to make use of your time/effort. but once your help ends, they being more popular has little incentive to be nice to you.

As you are weaker, less popular, and social clout, termination of your aid to them, renders your friendship very useless. Unless they think you have something to offer to them in the future, they do not need to actively maintain the friendship bridge.

But it pays to be nice to people, coz you do not know when you need their help. Sometimes, it pays to help them even if no return. for eg, to allievate you guilt, to make yourself feel better. "

And studies have shown that this initiative has in fact increased energy consumption because of demand surges after Earth Hour. Similarly, plastic straw bans were rolled out in many places around the world with much controversy and debate as well. So we have to be thoughtful about what banning straws was supposed to achieve, otherwise meaningless campaigns like this (which really feels like micromanaging tbh) will just give the public a bad impression on the environmental-friendly movement, and worse still give people a naïve opinion on what environmentalism really is all about."

5039,54105,"When I was with my ex, I was deeply unhappy. I didn't want to admit that I was unfulfilled and depressed because that means i had to also admit my relationship was a failure (or on the verge of failing) and it was frightening to know that I was going to lose something that meant a lot to me (at least it DID mean a lot to me). 

There was a period in our relationship that was particularly strained. Every night we quarrelled on the phone over trivial things.  Every time we met, it always ended on a sour note. Hectic schedules and other priorities prevented us from being there for each other when we needed support. It was the rockiest point of our time together and I felt so utterly alone that I knew I needed to reach out. 

I have this friend I used to be close with and slowly drifted apart after graduation. I really cherished our friendship and the conversations we had. I reached out to this friend after a long time of not speaking to each other, and we bonded really well. It felt like we fell exactly back in place where we left off. The dynamics were the same. We got each other's jokes. We could confide in each other without the fear of judgement. I remembered how good it used to feel. 

I got the warm fuzzy excited feeling of anticipation - the thrill of a renewed bond, the emotional satisfaction of a fulfilling companionship after such an extended period of emptiness despite being in a relationship. A spark was re-ignited in me.  I felt alive, and it wasn't all grey and dull and sad inside I saw bits and pieces of colours. Of hope. 

I think it was then I realised I'm actually doing a heinous, abominable thing - not only had I emotionally cheated (no excuses regardless of how brief or how unconscious it was) but I had also exploited the companionship this friend was willing to offer. This friend was loyal, sincere and kind - almost to a fault. I know this friend was not  romantically attracted to me but I couldn't help feeling the way I did.   

When I realised this, I was absolutely disgusted by myself. I hated myself to the core. How could I do such a thing? It's being extremely unfair to the two persons i care about and that is not okay. 

I decided to delete that friend from my contact list and suppress all urges to get in touch again. I never told my ex about it. 

Keeping it a secret was an overwhelmingly horrible feeling and I continued to be enveloped in disgust and contempt at the kind of person I am, the kind of person I have become. 

I have never clarified this matter with either of the parties involved. And to this day, I still feel guilty about it - even though I believe none of them truly cares anymore. 

I don't know how you will ever know this is for you. I guess i can only pray that the telepathy that used to exist between us remains intact. 

I just want to say I am really sorry for the way I treated you and our friendship. It's a horrible move on my part, and I acknowledge my mistake. I am learning to cope with being on my own and control the instinctive urge to find someone, anyone to fill the gap and silence. Now I force myself to sit with loneliness, to befriend it, to understand its core - and to overcome it. 

I hope that wherever you are now, whatever you are doing, you are safe and happy. But I  know you will be okay. 

I wish you nothing but the best in life. And if we ever speak again, I promise I will treat you the way you deserve to be treated.

She looked around to check that the coast is clear, before sticking her hand into a dark corner under the counter to pull out a plastic straw!

She didn't blame me, but asked if I didn't receive the email about the straw ban. I said I did and it mentioned about paper straws. She seemed confused about how a paper straw will ever work as a straw..

Apparently, stall owners like us students, aren't given any notice about the impending (or immediate, rather) ban on straws. I chatted further with auntie and asked what if she had just topped up her supply of straws just before the email was sent out? She shrugged in defeat, ""what to do?"".

5050,54089,"The iReject campaign has been going on for about a week now. I have tried hard to suppress my disagreement with the campaign due to the good underlying values it was trying to promote. However, from my personal experience, the aggregate value that the campaign is achieving seems to be less than the inconveniences and problems caused to the general student body. 

First as many on NUSWhispers have repeatedly lamented, the implementation of the campaign seems to be sorely lacking in proper planning. An email was sent out and the campaign was launched the following day. What then is the aim of the campaign? Is it merely a superficial act of stopping the usage of straws, or should the campaign be targeted at the larger problem of environmental conservation and changing our consumption habits. If it is the latter, where is the informative campaign that should accompany the initial launch. Overall the campaign feels like just another half-hearted attempt at appearing to care.

Secondly, there is no information disseminated by the campaign about the reason for promoting the alternatives of metal and paper straws. Has there been studies to show that metal and paper straws are better? The amount of energy needed to mine, refine and shape a metal straw may have the same carbon footprint as thousands of plastic straws. Paper straws on the hand, may face again the problem of either having a plastic lining or glues and wax used for waterproofing. This creates huge problems for recycling or reusing and may not actually be more environmentally friendly compared to plastic straws. I believe that as an institute of higher learning, we should question the pragmatism and impact of ideas we are propagating. 

The iReject campaign has caused many inconveniences for the student body, I believe that a campaign that the school runs on such scale must be backed up by facts and a proper plan of action. This is a call for all concerned individuals to join the telegram channel @strawfairiesSG as we seek to promote a constructive platform for discussion and search for answers.

5051,54088,"Every little bit matters even a straw. 

But one of the biggest environment decision one can make is to go child free. Let me explain.

while singapore being a developed country use more resource per person compared to average, there is a saving grace!

Our birthrate is Low and continue to be Low. Which is great coz from environmental perspective. solve overpopulation.

When you have one less child, you are bringing one less plastic consuming, fossil fuel burning, meat eating human to the world and hence reduce the burden. 

Economically might not make sense but environmentally it certainly does. World population are nearing 8billion. Time to do our part to reduce our population. (Singapore birth rate is good evidence of our commitment to reducing global warming) As Long as domestic birth rate is below replacement rate, we are doing our part. 

To make up the population shortfall, immigration is the main pillar of population growth. 

So singapore is net negative humans production facility. By allowing immigration we are taking excess human capacity of other countries.

Think of humans as a resource grabbing unit, the less the merrier. 

Optimal world population is probably about 3 billion. 

conceptually we are doing right by compensating the hyper population growth of other countries. Our Low birthrate really helps

How is everyone so upset over the removal of the straws?  Sorry you suffered a minor inconvenience on one day so that some wildlife doesn't end up suffocating.  The responses to (a very minor) change have shown exactly how entitled Singaporeans are.  We don't have time to ""slowly phase it out"" - we need to do things quickly.

Plastic cups should also be banned and replaced with bring your own cup (for those who want to take away) and borrowed cups (for those who stay).  We do that with cutlery, why not cups?

Stop complaining about people taking transport or generating other waste.  That only provides a reason to find a way to make these things sustainable or reduce their use.  It is irrelevant to the straws.  Any difference is better than nothing!

Yes, the waste in Singapore are indeed appropriately disposed at the landfill in Pulau Semakau. But guess what, thanks to the unprecedented amount of waste that we are generating, even with burning to reduce waste to ashes, the landfill will run out of space by 2035 (15 years earlier than expected). Then where shall we disposed our waste next? Cordone off another cluster of islands, drain out all the seawater, destroy the local marine life in the process, and go about our ""proper"" way of disposal? 

Yes, plastic straws take up minimal space in the landfill, but the rationale behind the entire movement is so that we, as university students, can take the lead in realising that we can forgo certain conveniences for the betterment of the environment. Think of the plastic bag that comes with the bubble tea drink that is promptly disposed right after the drink is finished or the plastic coffee stirrer that is used for merely 5 seconds, I think we can do much better.

I lost it around the afternoon after my lab in the morning at E4-03-07 (Digital Electronics Lab). My routes can be traced from E4-03-07 and to E3-06-11 and then to EA level 2. I only lost it this afternoon :(

My route was probably E4-03-07, then I took a lift to E4 level 5, walked past some study benches and LT1/2 and towards the toilets near E3-06-08 which is also near a water cooler which is next to a staircase landing. Then I proceeded to E3-06-11 for a tutorial I wanted to ""crash"", but the tutorial was cancelled so I went to EA level 2 (via passing by LT7) and then I realized my bottle was not with me when I was at EA.

Although it is just a water bottle, it is something I have grown sentimental towards over the course of a few months. I got it during a holiday to Melbourne during the summer break.

I know maybe it does sounds funny, but this water bottle is my favourite water bottle :/

The people behind it are claiming that they are “fighting” for the environment. Yet, we see the same people driving their own cars daily, taking Grab out of convenience, taking planes for leisure purposes, eating meat daily etc, harming the environment in more ways than using 100000 plastic straws would. 
An organisation that does not practice what it preaches has absolutely zero credibility. 

If a staunch environmentalist succeeds in lobbying the removal of shuttle buses around NUS, stating that we can all walk/use bikes and not be “lazy”, I am sure there would be an uproar, even amongst the supporters of “ban-the-straw”, due to the inconvenience caused. Who then sets the standard? Why is it that your convenience in taking the shuttle bus matters while my convenience in using straws does not? “The extra 20minutes of walking wont kill you” is the equivalent answer to “Bringing and washing a metal straw wont kill you”. 

“But at least we are doing something”. Once again, who sets the standard? The fact of the matter is we are ALL “doing something”. My choice of taking public transport instead of taking grab is “doing something”. If the standard is set to making meat only available on Mondays and Fridays, would BTS supporters be agreeable? After all, we do not need to eat meat and saving the earth is definitely more precious than your mere desire of wanting to consume meat.

5107,54002,"I had always believed that love is a choice. It happens because two people have made a decision to commit themselves to one another. When I saw how my parents' divorce had caused so much pain and misery to my mother even after a decade, I promised myself that I must always choose forgiveness no matter how ugly things become. So regardless of what my boyfriend or his family did to me, I forgave. Every single wrong, even if they are marked as red flags by my friends or family, I consciously choose to sweep them under the carpet one by one. 

But I am so tired. It has become difficult and exhausting to love him. Every day, I feel increasingly more detached and recently, I feel like I have reached my breaking point. Because of his impatience, he has caused a permanent shift in my medical condition for the worse. And now, I feel so bitter towards the man I once loved. I keep telling myself to forgive, but I really can't. I am just so angry and filled with hatred that I ripped the carpet apart. Now, I pick those mistakes up one by one, reminding myself of what he has done. The things in the past I thought I forgave, now makes me burn with hatred and rage.

I was so prepared to end this relationship. But before I could, he sensed it. He realised I stopped texting as much so he unmuted me. He says ""I love you"" whenever he sees me but it doesn't reach my heart anymore. He used to limit our dates to two meals a week but now, he wants me to come over almost every single day. I feel a change and I went soft. But at the same time, I am not won over. I can't seem to love him anymore. What he has done still cuts me deep so I give stupid excuses to slowly detach myself from him. ""You live too far."" ""You are too calculative."" ""Your parents treat me like I don't exist."" Things that don't matter are suddenly cited as my main reasons to push him away. Because while I am bitter, I can't bring myself to tell him the truth and the weight of what he has done to me. 

This one-sided relationship has turned a hundred and eighty degrees. Stepping away and looking at us, I can't help but feel like I am the bad person. Now, I am the unfeeling one. He is the one trying to make things work and I am the one detaching myself and making him cry. 

I feel bad and I think I should stop, not out of love, but out of the commitment I made to him 4 years ago. After all, love is a choice, isn't it? Even if the heart is confused, as long as there is a decision to commit, it will work out eventually. This is the man I promised, the one I gave my heart to. I don't want him to be cast aside. I don't want him to be left alone. But I am so conflicted. 

Either way, break up or stay, something doesn't feel right. I don't want to break his heart especially now that he has seemed to change. But I feel like I can't be with him anymore because of all the irreversible mistakes he has made. I am lost and so confused. I simply do not know what to do. "

Another 5% for 2000 word writeup on a random topic of choice (that somewhat had relation with the module), 5% MCQ midterms.

5126,53967,"Aside from the 1000-Straw Warrior, I get some of the valid points raised by those who don’t take well to the iReject campaign and hope to offer my views in response.

Going straw free is undeniably inconvenient and I agree with #53848 that they really add up and can make a bad day suck more. But I see it no different from stuff like taking a detour because of finding out that there’s construction on your usual route. Over time, we’ll adapt – walk another way, bring our own bottles etc. Once we come to expect it, we won’t be thrown off any more. I think calling the initiative draconian is an exaggeration. It seems like in Singapore, convenience is perceived as a human right, not a privilege and I believe this mindset has contributed to much of the backlash.

Some also suggested developing alternatives to straws. Given that researchers manage to produce a comparable, biodegradable, disposable alternative with their scientific sorcery (they probably have), consumers will still have to do their part – give them a rinse and dispose of them separately, so they don’t get mixed up with all the food waste and be incinerated with the rest of the trash. It takes two hands to clap. If people simply avoid straws/other plastics, nothing has to be done at all.

And of course, ideally, people would find the good in their hearts to be eco-friendly and we can slowly promote the culture without ‘forcing’ it on them. But most of us are too caught up with life to make eco-resolutions and stick to them despite being concerned and so could do with the push. And, as many uni students can relate, we procrastinate even for things of direct personal benefit, what more environment stuff? However, as studies have proven time and again, the environmental crisis is pressing. If “slowing down global destruction” was due at 2359, we’re probably at 2300hrs. I think too much is at stake for us to blindly hope for divine intervention or technological revolution. We can’t s/u Mother Earth yall.

Also, to agree that helping the environment should be encouraged in principle while refusing to give up even the smallest little luxuries or conveniences is just a politically correct but vacuous statement IMO. It’s like wanting to have your cake and eat it too. I’m not saying this to pagro at people who use straws but contribute in other ways. Rather, I’m referring to those who are expecting change with absolutely zero compromises or work on their part.

I think it’s perfectly fine to be pissed for a bit and offer constructive criticism about the implementation of the campaign (like having more education). It’s still in its teething stages and I think the initiative should be applauded. I’m glad that there is some healthy debate going on but the blind hate and angry tirades need to stop.

5131,53959,"In light of the recent drama against the plastic straw “ban”, here is a perspective from someone who supports the iReject campaign and hopes that the world can rid itself of disposables someday. 

Regarding the entire plastic straw “ban”, (I say “ban” because the school stated that they provide paper straws upon request) I agree that there was a lot that can be better managed. Yes, it could have been better communicated. Yes, it might have come as a rude shock to many of us who are used having straws with our drinks. Yes, there didn’t seem to be an alternative because of how paper straws that were supposed to be given on request were not given out. Yes, it’s so inconvenient when you reach out for that familiar straw to stir your drink, only to realise that it wasn’t there. 

You know what? I like straws too, because I’m used to having them around and I can’t deny that they are convenient. But when I know that I don’t NEED them, which I don’t take them anymore. (I know I am speaking from a position of privilege when I say this because not everyone has this choice to reject straws because they can.) When I committed myself to stop using straws last year unless necessary (i.e. bubble tea pearls :3), it wasn’t hard. It’s not like going on a plant-based diet where you have to actively look for meat-free food. All it took was saying no when offered a straw while getting weird looks and questions like “huh then how you drink” “walao can don’t so environmentally friendly or not?” and using my two hands to hold my cup and drink from it. Sure, it took some getting used to but soon drinking without straws became normal – normal enough for me to diss friends who were drinking with straws. Habits can change.

I just hope that the angst that the lack of communication of the project has brought does not dilute the greater meaning behind rejecting straws in the first place. Straws are just a small part of the entire problem of single-use disposables, which are although at times necessary, most of the time they are not. At least recognise why they are a problem and realise that we as consumers are also part of the problem. All single-used disposables have a super short life cycle, which means that lots of energy goes into producing them. Energy means fossil fuels which also means emissions that could have been avoided if we all just took one less plastic straw, plastic bag, or even paper cup etcetc. They pollute oceans (google Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch), ruin lives of marine creatures (sea viral turtle video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw) and take forever to break down. Even though we incinerate our rubbish in Singapore, remember that toxic chemicals are still produced in the process. The list goes on, and I can write more if we want to bring in the topic of climate change and how it affects animals and people around the world. 

I think we can differentiate for ourselves what it means to be a need and want. Instead of tearing the campaign down, let it be a reminder to what you can and should do as a fellow human being living on this planet. 

TLDR:

[1] I hope people see the straws ""ban"" as a well-intended project despite its shortcomings, and definitely not write off the cause against disposables as meaningless. Think about whether you really need that straw, plastic cup, plastic bag, flyer before you actually take it.

[2] Differentiate between what it means to be a NEED and a WANT. (No, convenience =/= need). 

[3]  Please, please remember that the implications of taking another piece of disposable does not just come at the price of your convenience, but at the cost of our planet too. 

[4] On a sidenote, for those who feel that they absolutely cannot live without straws, here’s a gentle reminder on other ways to be more environmentally friendly –bringing your own containers to takeaway food (you even get a $2 discount in NUS!!), bringing your own reusable bags/ reusing  plastic bags for shopping, taking public transport, supporting ethical businesses etcetc

5132,53958,"Uni really has shown me the tediousness and frustrations of group work, especially where different personalities mix. 

Put one extrovert who can't shut up in a group and suddenly that extrovert will literally drive the entire group in his/her direction, shooting down objections and insisting on his/her way.
But due to the extrovert's amazing charisma, no one really dares doubt or go against him/her. It's impossible to politely tell an extrovert to just...STOP talking for once. Meanwhile it's very easy for this extrovert to politely tell OTHERS to shut up.

A group of introverts only on the other hand, can peacefully pool together their ideas more collectively while taking into account everyone's different opinions and interests. Unfortunately it's quite rare for the latter and more common for the former, to have at least one domineering extrovert present.

With more than extrovert on the other hand, and you're likely to have some group conflict OR these extroverts now dominating the entire group direction and discussion in their way.

However, I think it's quite apparent that you are uncomfortable with his current actions (eg. pestering you, waiting for you for long hours just to eat, etc). Bottom line, I think you should set proper boundaries with him. Since he's just a friend, and not your boyfriend or anything, I think its alright to let him know that he should not transgress sound boundaries.

But I do find the readings manageable as long as you keep abreast of them and clarify your doubts through email or by asking prof when you can.

There's no reason to bash him for selecting the readings - it's a intro course, so we don't go in depth, but there is still a large scope of content to cover to give a full overview of the differing philosophies. To be really frank, I found this week's readings hard too, but I don't think it's really anything to take to the streets (NUSWhispers) and shout about.

If you're really struggling and the TA cannot help, I guess you could always book a consultation with prof himself. It's philo, nobody said it was easy.

Hello #53863! Just want to say, dont put yourself down like that. I too lost all my JC friends after JC, entered army and made a lot good friends there, so I can relate to that front part of your story. In fact your story reminds me so much of myself back in my JC-army-Y1 days.

However I would like to say that making friends in Uni is a totally different ballgame from NS unit days. In NS, everyone is going through the same thing together at relatively the same pace. Its easy to relate to one another, and hence make friends. You guys also live together(or even work office hours together for non-combat soldiers) 5 days a week, and in NS its generally better/advantageous to work well together with your unit mates. Hence under such conditions, friendship actually comes rather naturally, and even if it dont come in 1week, you still have the next week, next month, in fact 2 years.

Now Uni is totally different. Everyone has different commitments, everyone leads their life at a different pace, there is also not a need to work together. To make things ""worst"" you only have like perhaps 1-4hours of interaction per week from either tut/lec/cca. If you dont capitalize on that short amount of time to talk to people and try to know more people, you will find that time pass by so fast, 1 sem is over and you know no one. Next sem comes, you see new people again. 

In my y1 days i was in a similar situation as you, I wish people would just open up to me, and i was afraid to open up to others because I did not think i was worthy of anything. I was a quiet person throughout my sec sch to jc to army. However I soon come to realise that by waiting for someone to open up to me, that will be like gambling and hoping I get lucky to meet such a person. 

Year 2 came, and from that year on all the way to y4 I decided to just try to talk to anyone beside me in tutorial or lecture who I find interesting. I would say the number of times i felt like i embarrassed myself was so many I cannot count. However this should not stop you! Take it as like a learning process. Its easy to say ""I am quiet thats why i have problems making friends"". Identifying that is good, but you have to work on it too! I promise you it gets easier as you ""practice"" more and more. It doesnt matter even if you made no friends eventually, what is important is you have learned to open up and be comfortable initiating conversations, and this my friend will go a long way.

If you dont take the first step to try, you will never learn. Dont think about how others will judge you, everyone is in fact too busy thinking about themselves anyway to judge you. But one important thing to remember and live by is ""No one owes you anything"", talking to someone does not mean he will be willing to be your friend. But it doesnt matter, KEEP TRYING. 

Love yourself! When you stop putting yourself down all the time, you will become more comfortable opening up to others. When you think you are not worth others time, of course you will fear interacting with them.

Just take it as a learning process when it comes to interacting with strangers in Uni, leave friendship to fate. But one thing i know for sure is: If you dont try even fate cant help you.




"
5148,53930,"#53863 To the guy who posted about having no friends: I certainly can empathise with u as I'm a loner myself too. You are certainly lucky to find a group of mates in army. I graduated from NUS 4 years ago and am happily married now. I feel that it would be good to share my experience here since this topic was brought up. Since young I am always extremely introverted and shy. This means not only I feel difficult to approach people, I have also no motivation to make friends. And this goes on in a vicious cycle for years. From primary school till university, I have zero friends and social life. Because of my personality, I find it extremely hard to socialize in large groups. Even on 1-1 with people, I always find that I run out of stuff to talk in a few minutes. I lived life pretty much in silos and spent almost all the time at home. 

Most of the precious few friendships I had are based on practical reasons e.g. project mates or colleagues and immediately died off once the activity is over. Other friends are mostly hi-bye friends whose friendship never progressed past a certain point. I find that as I age and mature, I do gradually overcome the shyness part but I am still the introvert I am. This means I love to spend time alone. I am working now and while I am able to get the job done with colleagues, I am never truly friends with them. I felt very lucky to have met my wife in NUS (she's a fellow introvert too, I met her by chance and it does make it easier to interact between 2 introverts but that's another long story). Now apart from my wife and family, there's no other person whom I can truly have a friendship with and enjoy the time together. I certainly have accepted myself for who I am as I know that deep down, I am still the introverted loner I am and that part will stay with me for as long as I live. I believe every one has some part in them that they might not be happy with. But it's more important to appreciate the small little good things that come into your life and be grateful for what you already have, and not mull over what you don't. Best wishes to you and hope that you'd be able to live life without regrets."
5149,53929,Found this in the business school. So apt. 
5150,53926,"#53888: first, the idea that modern wars will be fought not by men with rifles but rather machines, network, precision-guided munitions, etc ... is a rather old idea. It was called ""revolution in military affairs"" (RMA). Soon after, we found out that there was a ""counter-revolution"". Indeed, if you look at wars after 1945, they all followed a common pattern. Somehow they all, except for Gulf War 1.0 1991, ended with boots on the ground, infantry with rifles going in personally. This is true for Israel-Lebanon war, Gulf War 2.0, Afghanistan (the most recent, ongoing one), and will likely to be so.

The reasoning is very simple: RMA idea is surveillance technologies will become so good that anything that can be spotted will be firepower mouse clicked away. Of course your enemy is very impolite and they will try to avoid getting killed. Thermal imaging with million dollars drones in Afghanistan was defeated by ... Talibans draping blankets over their bodies, but I digress. The problem with RMA's idea is if you don't show up to the battlefield and present a target for them to shoot at, why should they? They disperse, go into hiding, then ambush a convoy of soft-skin wheeled trucks that roll down the road, plant roadside bombs, bomb the restaurant your officers go to for lunch, assassinate the officers when they pop down to the local brother, etc ... All wars have descended and regressed to infantry on infantry with rifles on rifles.

The idea of a scholar-officer is a rather British method of recruiting officers. You find a overly educated chaps with bloodlust, slap on them some nice uniforms, give them a pistol (to threaten executions of insubordinate privates), then push them to the front. The company and below commanders' primary jobs are to stand up straight and lead the men into fire. If they get killed, they did their job. On the other hand, the British army is a professional and rather well-trained volunteer army with a decent non-commissioned officers who are well-versed at the tactical fightings. The upper echelons of the British commands are also generally good officers with good leadership skills though their tactical, operational skills maybe below that of the best. So the idea of a scholar-general is not a bad one; though remember that generals have a ""last-war-itis"": they try to fight the current war like last war. Note that big wars used to occur once every 2-3 generations or so and the changes in technologies and tactics meant that the soldiers will have to pay for the mistakes in the first period of the war. The point of my post was to point out that there is nothing glamourous or macho about being a conscript; they are all meat for the meat grinder anyway. However, the knowledge that generals and officers being so far away from danger, coddled in security and comfort have a deleterious effect on morale. It manifested occasionally by the privates lashing out at the officers by ""fragging""; or killing of one's superior. Good generals have to have a balance. A compromise approach is to have a charismatic, courageous general the likes of Montgomery, Patton, or MacArthur to be the face of the command (while being less than stellar), and to have another actually competent Chief of Staff who do the actual cold-blooded calculations and planning.

The cold-blooded calculation goes something like. OK, the enemy has one Division occupying a 5km front. We want that sector. So we'll concentrate 5 Divisions on that 5km front and breakthrough. However, we need to confuse the enemy of the real axis of advance, so we'll need to tell a few poor divisions over there to attack on a 20km front. They will likely be slaughtered in the face of numerically equal but dug-in troops, but it's a necessary sacrifice to win (a paraphrased plan of Operation Bagration, 1944). Here is the point where you need a charismatic officer/general to tell the poor divisions to attack wholeheartedly and suffer the casualties.

Brad Pitt's War Machine is a thinly-veiled fictionalisation of the service of General McChrystal in Afghanistan. For a very good overview of how battalion and below commanders really work, I'll recommend the book Generation Kill by Evan Wright, which documented the action of 1st Recon Marine battalion in Iraq. The book was adapted into the HBO series: Generation Kill. The officers in there are colourful people: one good platoon commander, an aggressive but somewhat dimwitted sister platoon commander (Captain America), a more dimwitted company commander nicknamed Encino Man (a caveman-thawed-out-in-modern-day fictional character), an ultra-aggressive battalion commander who is a cancer survivor and seemingly intended to get everyone killed so he can get medals. The problem with the majority of them seem to be that the unit was a stealthy, recon unit with scholarly commanders who typically stayed behind the line and analyse the intel, but suddenly thrown into a blitzkrieg type of combat. The officers adjusted slowly and the men had nothing but contempt for them. The ""good"" platoon commander put out his own book: One Bullet Away by Nathaniel Fick.

In general, the defense of Singapore, few publications available on it as it is, is rather sound. Singapore has an arms manufacture company: ST Kinetics, and a few Defense Research organisations. They are good ways to channel tax money into developing new technologies (the easiest way to convince the public to throw money at uncertain research projects is by telling them ""it's for defense""). ST Kinetics is producing all the important weapons for modern wars: rifles, mortars, artillery, and light tracked vehicles (given that all wars descended to infantry combat).

All HDBs appear to have hardened shelters: casualties in a bombardment rise significantly if the civilians have to scramble from their homes looking for public shelters. Now if the occupants of HDBs stop shoving miscellaneous crap into that shelter (or taking off the heavy steel door) and start putting food, water, radio, battery, stove, fuel, etc ... that will be excellent. There are impressive saber-rattlings by the Singapore Air Force.

It's so much easier be a girl in school. It's easier for normal girls to form friendship than normal guys. It's much easier for girls to get help. Girls are way less likely to get ""arrowed"" or picked up by teachers. Girl cliques can hold hands and go toilet together, boy cliques, never.

I can empathise with what you're going through, and what you're feeling.
And I won't bother trying to convince you or proclaim to be an expert on the technicalities of socialising.

Long story short: Make the best outta life. Literally.
When you start to genuinely realise the time you have alive and the time you have to do what you love, is finite, then do you truly understand how to ""make the best"" out of life. You mention you're ""secretly filled with emotions"". Why keep it a secret? Is that what you'd want to do for the rest of your life til you die?

""Move on with life"" ""Adapt, I was told"" ""I try, but it just doesn't get me anywhere""
That's because you aren't really trying. You're just taking those phrases at their shallowest level.
MY advice to you would be to live life to the fullest. Still can't grasp what I'm trying to mean?

5177,53888,"#53888: first, the idea that modern wars will be fought not by men with rifles but rather machines, network, precision-guided munitions, etc ... is a rather old idea. It was called ""revolution in military affairs"" (RMA). Soon after, we found out that there was a ""counter-revolution"". Indeed, if you look at wars after 1945, they all followed a common pattern. Somehow they all, except for Gulf War 1.0 1991, ended with boots on the ground, infantry with rifles going in personally. This is true for Israel-Lebanon war, Gulf War 2.0, Afghanistan (the most recent, ongoing one), and will likely to be so.

The reasoning is very simple: RMA idea is surveillance technologies will become so good that anything that can be spotted will be firepower mouse clicked away. Of course your enemy is very impolite and they will try to avoid getting killed. Thermal imaging with million dollars drones in Afghanistan was defeated by ... Talibans draping blankets over their bodies, but I digress. The problem with RMA's idea is if you don't show up to the battlefield and present a target for them to shoot at, why should they? They disperse, go into hiding, then ambush a convoy of soft-skin wheeled trucks that roll down the road, plant roadside bombs, bomb the restaurant your officers go to for lunch, assassinate the officers when they pop down to the local brother, etc ... All wars have descended and regressed to infantry on infantry with rifles on rifles.

The idea of a scholar-officer is a rather British method of recruiting officers. You find a overly educated chaps with bloodlust, slap on them some nice uniforms, give them a pistol (to threaten executions of insubordinate privates), then push them to the front. The company and below commanders' primary jobs are to stand up straight and lead the men into fire. If they get killed, they did their job. On the other hand, the British army is a professional and rather well-trained volunteer army with a decent non-commissioned officers who are well-versed at the tactical fightings. The upper echelons of the British commands are also generally good officers with good leadership skills though their tactical, operational skills maybe below that of the best. So the idea of a scholar-general is not a bad one; though remember that generals have a ""last-war-itis"": they try to fight the current war like last war. Note that big wars used to occur once every 2-3 generations or so and the changes in technologies and tactics meant that the soldiers will have to pay for the mistakes in the first period of the war. The point of my post was to point out that there is nothing glamourous or macho about being a conscript; they are all meat for the meat grinder anyway. However, the knowledge that generals and officers being so far away from danger, coddled in security and comfort have a deleterious effect on morale. It manifested occasionally by the privates lashing out at the officers by ""fragging""; or killing of one's superior. Good generals have to have a balance. A compromise approach is to have a charismatic, courageous general the likes of Montgomery, Patton, or MacArthur to be the face of the command (while being less than stellar), and to have another actually competent Chief of Staff who do the actual cold-blooded calculations and planning.

The cold-blooded calculation goes something like. OK, the enemy has one Division occupying a 5km front. We want that sector. So we'll concentrate 5 Divisions on that 5km front and breakthrough. However, we need to confuse the enemy of the real axis of advance, so we'll need to tell a few poor divisions over there to attack on a 20km front. They will likely be slaughtered in the face of numerically equal but dug-in troops, but it's a necessary sacrifice to win (a paraphrased plan of Operation Bagration, 1944). Here is the point where you need a charismatic officer/general to tell the poor divisions to attack wholeheartedly and suffer the casualties.

Brad Pitt's War Machine is a thinly-veiled fictionalisation of the service of General McChrystal in Afghanistan. For a very good overview of how battalion and below commanders really work, I'll recommend the book Generation Kill by Evan Wright, which documented the action of 1st Recon Marine battalion in Iraq. The book was adapted into the HBO series: Generation Kill. The officers in there are colourful people: one good platoon commander, an aggressive but somewhat dimwitted sister platoon commander (Captain America), a more dimwitted company commander nicknamed Encino Man (a caveman-thawed-out-in-modern-day fictional character), an ultra-aggressive battalion commander who is a cancer survivor and seemingly intended to get everyone killed so he can get medals. The problem with the majority of them seem to be that the unit was a stealthy, recon unit with scholarly commanders who typically stayed behind the line and analyse the intel, but suddenly thrown into a blitzkrieg type of combat. The officers adjusted slowly and the men had nothing but contempt for them. The ""good"" platoon commander put out his own book: One Bullet Away by Nathaniel Fick.

In general, the defense of Singapore, few publications available on it as it is, is rather sound. Singapore has an arms manufacture company: ST Kinetics, and a few Defense Research organisations. They are good ways to channel tax money into developing new technologies (the easiest way to convince the public to throw money at uncertain research projects is by telling them ""it's for defense""). ST Kinetics is producing all the important weapons for modern wars: rifles, mortars, artillery, and light tracked vehicles (given that all wars descended to infantry combat).

All HDBs appear to have hardened shelters: casualties in a bombardment rise significantly if the civilians have to scramble from their homes looking for public shelters. Now if the occupants of HDBs stop shoving miscellaneous crap into that shelter (or taking off the heavy steel door) and start putting food, water, radio, battery, stove, fuel, etc ... that will be excellent. There are impressive saber-rattlings by the Singapore Air Force. I remember reading the SAF bragging somewhere that everyday they take off from an airbase with the aircraft nose pointed at Malaysia; after taking off, the aircraft all took a sharp hard turn to avoid entering Malaysian airspace, showing readiness and skills. A lazy general will simply tell the pilots take off with the nose pointing at the sea. An effect counter-saber-rattling by the Malaysian in Johor will be to tell the anti-air radar to switch on the targeting radar and ""paint"" the SAF jets, which will be detected by the Radar Warner.

Story 3: this is something that still embitters me to this day. When I was working in Singapore in a shockingly average research job for a shockingly average salary, I rented a room in an HDB owned by a Muslim Indonesian family of three. The husband was a worker in Jurong West food court; salary was somewhere in the 1000-1500 range, according to similar job postings. The wife was a housewife with a bad pair of legs and not so good mobility. The only child was a secondary school student. The child was probably on some sort of financial aid (I saw a sticker for such service). Another I noted was their very late dinner/family time. Food Court workers in Singapore go home very late (the food courts open until quite late). The family dinner quite often included leftovers the husband brought back, as a result, the family had late dinners (~12pm). Think about this for a second, the child was in secondary school; when do secondary schools starts? How much quality sleep could she got? She probably made up for this by early evening naps (I notice she sleeping in the living room couch, which I passed by going to my room).

What embittered me was what happened shortly before my departure from Singapore. When I left, I cleaned the room spotlessly and nothing was broken. The landlord checked the room and agreed to pay me back the deposit (one month of rent). He, however, cited difficulties in getting the money: “I have 200 dollars in my bank account”. He did noted that I was flying off and to this day, he did not pay me back the deposit. I still have the agreement he signed and if I have time, I can definitely get it through Small Claims Court. However, doing this will cost me more than that paltry deposit.

During the time of my departure, there was an effort to slow down hiring of foreigners for middle-class type jobs, mostly due to Singaporean middle-class types decently vocal complaints. I have no problems with them doing that; it’s their countries and their political systems. I spoke to the Executive Director of my Institute and he confirmed the situation that A*STAR was prioritising my kind of jobs to Singaporeans. Nevertheless, he assured me that there were enough leeway to keep someone like me around. I’m not sure how much of that policy helped middle-class Singaporeans; research institutes live and die on public funding and my institute was on a dry spell of funding cuts (30-50% cuts in a 4 years period). However, I realized that the policy hurt the poorest the quickest and they reap the least benefit. Let me explain: the family had a three bedrooms flat, which is by no means poor by most cities' standards; they rented out 2 and the three of them piled up in the Master bedroom, which had bunk beds and such. Also think for a moment the kind of privacy a married couple need and how hard that will be since children are always home. This family was by no mean a rarity. Let me list a few other family situations in HDB rooms I rented:

-	Young, recently married, and childless couple in spanking 3 bedrooms new apartment. The husband was a Singapore Air Force mechanic (Iron Rice Bowl kind of job) and  the wife worked as unpaid, volunteer (probably) residential “advisor” of some sort in NTU. Rented out all 3 rooms and they live in a makeshift, cordoned off section in the rather spacious living room built out of glass panes and curtains. The occupants of the bedrooms: a student couple, me, and a contract researchers couple (for one of the Bio Contract Research company) from the Philippines.

-	Indian family of 4: working husband, housewife, overboard university student son (found his diary in my room), and secondary school daughter in 3 bedrooms apartment. Again, all piled up in one bedroom and rented out the other 2. Renters are myself and a Chinese foreign student couple.

The problem of middle-class foreigners like me leaving Singapore is in the short run, the income of those families are cut by 30-50%. The two rooms were rented out to me and another foreign software engineer. I stayed there for 2 years, after one year, the other guy left and the room was not rented out to the day I left a year later. Possibly was due to the decreased flow of foreign workers. That room was ~300-400/month.

All the families I rented from all have decent flats, but they are married couples with children who had to sacrifice their privacy and marriage life to have the same income as I did (or a bit less); feeding a family of 3-4 and paying off the mortgage. The ""extra"" middle-class type job left opened by someone like me, does not help them at all; it's unlikely that any of them are qualified for such job. Statistically speaking, the girl from that family is unlikely to get into the same University that I did (though the standards may slide in the next few years). The deposit that was scammed off me represented about 4% extra monthly rent for my stay there. Thinking about it now, them getting a few hundreds extra bucks did not get them any richer, nor did our relative financial standings change significantly."
5184,53880,"Regarding the i reject campaign, the vocal minority has voiced their displeasure. I feel that however strawless campaign has benefited me a lot of ways.

I am bringing KFC habits to other fast food restaurant.

On a more serious note, Nothing is too small. 1 straw is just the beginning. 
As we go on go with our lives, we should reduce wastage (food, electricity, materials, books). Bring your own containers if possible. Take public transport. 

If we cant even bear the inconvenience of 1 straw, how can we expect companies to change, who are we to expect countries abide with Kyoto Protocol. 

Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. In this era overpopulation and over consumption, Singapore being a developed country consume resources disproportional to its population. And you will realize compared to an average human, we do place a large burden on the environment. 

ONE straw is just a start. A small gesture of your commitment to reduce pollution and global warming.

But your immature action of buying 1000 straws and throwing them in dustbins is pointless. You need to understand that the accelerator of the movement really came from the sea turtle that got a straw stuck up its nose. Because of that, we are experiencing a blanket ban on all straws so that a small percentage of them do not accidentally leak out into the ocean and kill more sea turtles. You know what I would do? Instead of being a childish prick, I would dump 1000 straws into the ocean. Not only will this offset the movement but it will double down on the stupid straw ban. Maybe 1 million straws were used and 100 leaked out into the ocean. Now less straws are used but yet 1000 leaked out into the ocean. “Environmentalists” : 0. The rest of the world: 1"

Think about this for a second, the child was in secondary school; when do secondary schools starts? How much quality sleep could she got? She probably made up for this by early evening naps (I notice she sleeping in the living room couch, which I passed by going to my room).

What embittered me was what happened shortly before my departure from Singapore. When I left, I cleaned the room spotlessly and nothing was broken. The landlord checked the room and agreed to pay me back the deposit (one month of rent). He, however, cited difficulties in getting the money: “I have 200 dollars in my bank account”. He did noted that I was flying off and to this day, he did not pay me back the deposit. I still have the agreement he signed and if I have time, I can definitely get it through Small Claims Court. However, doing this will cost me more than that paltry deposit.

During the time of my departure, there was an effort to slow down hiring of foreigners for middle-class type jobs, mostly due to Singaporean middle-class types decently vocal complaints. I have no problems with them doing that; it’s their countries and their political systems. I spoke to the Executive Director of my Institute and he confirmed the situation that A*STAR was prioritising my kind of jobs to Singaporeans. Nevertheless, he assured me that there were enough leeway to keep someone like me around. I’m not sure how much of that policy helped middle-class Singaporeans; research institutes live and die on public funding and my institute was on a dry spell of funding cuts (30-50% cuts in a 4 years period). However, I realized that the policy hurt the poorest the quickest and they reap the least benefit. Let me explain: the family had a three bedrooms flat, which is by no means poor by most cities' standards; they rented out 2 and the three of them piled up in the Master bedroom, which had bunk beds and such. Also think for a moment the kind of privacy a married couple need and how hard that will be since children are always home. This family was by no mean a rarity. Let me list a few other family situations in HDB rooms I rented:

-	Young, recently married, and childless couple in spanking 3 bedrooms new apartment. The husband was a Singapore Air Force mechanic (Iron Rice Bowl kind of job) and  the wife worked as unpaid, volunteer (probably) residential “advisor” of some sort in NTU. Rented out all 3 rooms and they live in a makeshift, cordoned off section in the rather spacious living room built out of glass panes and curtains. The occupants of the bedrooms: a student couple, me, and a contract researchers couple (for one of the Bio Contract Research company) from the Philippines.

-	Indian family of 4: working husband, housewife, overboard university student son (found his diary in my room), and secondary school daughter in 3 bedrooms apartment. Again, all piled up in one bedroom and rented out the other 2. Renters are myself and a Chinese foreign student couple.

The problem of middle-class foreigners like me leaving Singapore is in the short run, the income of those families are cut by 30-50%. The two rooms were rented out to me and another foreign software engineer. I stayed there for 2 years, after one year, the other guy left and the room was not rented out to the day I left a year later. Possibly was due to the decreased flow of foreign workers. That room was ~300-400/month.

All the families I rented from all have decent flats, but they are married couples with children who had to sacrifice their privacy and marriage life to have the same income as I did (or a bit less); feeding a family of 3-4 and paying off the mortgage. The ""extra"" middle-class type job left opened by someone like me, does not help them at all; it's unlikely that any of them are qualified for such job. Statistically speaking, the girl from that family is unlikely to get into the same University that I did (though the standards may slide in the next few years). The deposit that was scammed off me represented about 4% extra monthly rent for my stay there. Thinking about it now, them getting a few hundreds extra bucks did not get them any richer, nor did our relative financial standings change significantly."

5198,53863,"(Disclaimer: did not expect it to be so long.. so well)

Hello #53863! Just want to say, dont put yourself down like that. I too lost all my JC friends after JC, entered army and made a lot good friends there, so I can relate to that front part of your story. In fact your story reminds me so much of myself back in my JC-army-Y1 days.

However I would like to say that making friends in Uni is a totally different ballgame from NS unit days. In NS, everyone is going through the same thing together at relatively the same pace. Its easy to relate to one another, and hence make friends. You guys also live together(or even work office hours together for non-combat soldiers) 5 days a week, and in NS its generally better/advantageous to work well together with your unit mates. Hence under such conditions, friendship actually comes rather naturally, and even if it dont come in 1week, you still have the next week, next month, in fact 2 years.

Now Uni is totally different. Everyone has different commitments, everyone leads their life at a different pace, there is also not a need to work together. To make things ""worst"" you only have like perhaps 1-4hours of interaction per week from either tut/lec/cca. If you dont capitalize on that short amount of time to talk to people and try to know more people, you will find that time pass by so fast, 1 sem is over and you know no one. Next sem comes, you see new people again. 

In my y1 days i was in a similar situation as you, I wish people would just open up to me, and i was afraid to open up to others because I did not think i was worthy of anything. I was a quiet person throughout my sec sch to jc to army. However I soon come to realise that by waiting for someone to open up to me, that will be like gambling and hoping I get lucky to meet such a person. 

Year 2 came, and from that year on all the way to y4 I decided to just try to talk to anyone beside me in tutorial or lecture who I find interesting. I would say the number of times i felt like i embarrassed myself was so many I cannot count. However this should not stop you! Take it as like a learning process. Its easy to say ""I am quiet thats why i have problems making friends"". Identifying that is good, but you have to work on it too! I promise you it gets easier as you ""practice"" more and more. It doesnt matter even if you made no friends eventually, what is important is you have learned to open up and be comfortable initiating conversations, and this my friend will go a long way.

If you dont take the first step to try, you will never learn. Dont think about how others will judge you, everyone is in fact too busy thinking about themselves anyway to judge you. But one important thing to remember and live by is ""No one owes you anything"", talking to someone does not mean he will be willing to be your friend. But it doesnt matter, KEEP TRYING. 

Love yourself! When you stop putting yourself down all the time, you will become more comfortable opening up to others. When you think you are not worth others time, of course you will fear interacting with them.

Just take it as a learning process when it comes to interacting with strangers in Uni, leave friendship to fate. But one thing i know for sure is: If you dont try even fate cant help you.

5200,53857,"To post #53857,

I like how you did all the calculations for the military strategy. But my post is slightly off topic from your main focus.

I want to talk about the idea on having scholars in the army. I am not a SAF scholar, but I don't like it when people say that scholars make lousy generals. From what I see in places like ST's fb comment section, many people assume that those with the rank of LTC and above take up arms and charge towards the enemy like recruits in BMT. 

Like what OP 53857 mentioned, military tactics involve a lot of calculations and strategy when you're at the top. I believe the movie War Machine with Brad Pitt as a 4-star general shows the REAL work of the upper management in military during conflicts. It's a lot of policy making, strategy and politics (in it's true sense, not office politics)

With that being said, doesn't the idea of scholar generals make sense? Just my 2 cents."

5205,53848,"Aside from the 1000-Straw Warrior, I get some of the valid points raised by those who don’t take well to the iReject campaign and hope to offer my views in response.

Going straw free is undeniably inconvenient and I agree with #53848 that they really add up and can make a bad day suck more. But I see it no different from stuff like taking a detour because of finding out that there’s construction on your usual route. Over time, we’ll adapt – walk another way, bring our own bottles etc. Once we come to expect it, we won’t be thrown off any more. I think calling the initiative draconian is an exaggeration. It seems like in Singapore, convenience is perceived as a human right, not a privilege and I believe this mindset has contributed to much of the backlash.

Some also suggested developing alternatives to straws. Given that researchers manage to produce a comparable, biodegradable, disposable alternative with their scientific sorcery (they probably have), consumers will still have to do their part – give them a rinse and dispose of them separately, so they don’t get mixed up with all the food waste and be incinerated with the rest of the trash. It takes two hands to clap. If people simply avoid straws/other plastics, nothing has to be done at all.

And of course, ideally, people would find the good in their hearts to be eco-friendly and we can slowly promote the culture without ‘forcing’ it on them. But most of us are too caught up with life to make eco-resolutions and stick to them despite being concerned and so could do with the push. And, as many uni students can relate, we procrastinate even for things of direct personal benefit, what more environment stuff? However, as studies have proven time and again, the environmental crisis is pressing. If “slowing down global destruction” was due at 2359, we’re probably at 2300hrs. I think too much is at stake for us to blindly hope for divine intervention or technological revolution. We can’t s/u Mother Earth yall.

Also, to agree that helping the environment should be encouraged in principle while refusing to give up even the smallest little luxuries or conveniences is just a politically correct but vacuous statement IMO. It’s like wanting to have your cake and eat it too. I’m not saying this to pagro at people who use straws but contribute in other ways. Rather, I’m referring to those who are expecting change with absolutely zero compromises or work on their part.

I think it’s perfectly fine to be pissed for a bit and offer constructive criticism about the implementation of the campaign (like having more education). It’s still in its teething stages and I think the initiative should be applauded. I’m glad that there is some healthy debate going on but the blind hate and angry tirades need to stop.

Instead of being a childish prick, I would dump 1000 straws into the ocean. Not only will this offset the movement but it will double down on the stupid straw ban. Maybe 1 million straws were used and 100 leaked out into the ocean. Now less straws are used but yet 1000 leaked out into the ocean. “Environmentalists” : 0. The rest of the world: 1"

So how did this start? With my ice kopi. I've come to enjoy my simple pleasure of getting a cup of ice kopi, the top sealed with plastic and a colourful straw to sip it from. Today, I did not have that pleasure. I received the same ice kopi, same plastic cup, but a different cover for my drink. A plastic one, similar to those you find at any fast food restaurant. BUT there were no straws. This, according to a tiny sign available at the stall, was due to the iReject Campaign to reduce waste.

Now I don't want people thinking that I don't support environmental conservation, I do. I think it's great that the school is trying to help the environment. At the same time, there are certain inconveniences that happen when you try to change things overnight. Like for example, this unhappy post on NUSWhispers. Personally, I dislike drinking my ice kopi straight from the top, the ice melts and dilutes the flavour. It's also caused me a bit of grief in that it still spills despite the cover. I'm sure a lot of people will be talking about how I should suck it up for the greater good, but the thing is, minor inconveniences like these add up.

So hopefully, now I have your attention with the ice kopi story. Let's now talk about one of the first things that bothered me. Those new to the school probably don't know this, but the internet used to be far more stable. Around 2-3 semesters ago, my Wi-Fi connected automatically. Essentially, the school was a second home to me. The network was smooth, I could do my work or even play games on the network. IT. WAS. WONDERFUL. Not to say it didn't have disruptions now and again, but overall it was stable.


Now, the Wi-Fi fails frequently and constantly requires me to retype my NUSNet ID and password. Even after entering it successfully (I made my password visible so I can ensure it was correct) multiple times, I still fail to connect. If you've ever rushed a deadline, you'll know how important it is to have a good internet connection. As I recall, this only began happening once the school decided to switch from 1 NUS Network to multiple sub-networks (NUS_STU etc.). Sure maybe I don't need to have internet access all the time, I should go enjoy nature, or talk to someone, maybe over a meal?

Turns out, even having a meal could be an issue if the Campus had truly gone cashless! E-Payment uses the internet (that should be obvious, but just in case I'll state it). Now if you have a data plan, that may be a slight nuisance but you can still pay, but if for whatever reason both the school Wi-Fi and your data do not work... Guess you'll starve? Now you probably think what are the odds of that happening? Well given the frequency that the school Wi-Fi doesn't work, in addition to freak accidents (like a fire at Singtel), I'd say the chances are very likely.

So maybe I am being overly angsty, but could whoever is rolling out these initiatives at least TEST THEM OUT first? Or at very least, transition a little more gradually? Even a feedback box is fine, rather than saying ""this is your life now, deal with it.""

Lastly, if any NUSSU members are reading this, I voted for the current committee, I hope you could help me voice these concerns to the school, as was promised in your campaign."

5233,53802,"I always hear or see people asking if its still possible to score an A after getting 25th or median percentile for midterms.

Assuming your midterm weighs less than 30% of your entire grade.

You gotta estimate if your midterm score differs far from the 75th percentile. If you think that you are only 1 or 2% away from 75th percentile, then definitely you are able to get A for finals. Lets say you score 16/20 and got 25th percentile. If that test weighs 20%, you have only lost 4% of your grade.

In my experience, if you get 90% or even 85% for your entire grade, chances are you are an A. Of cos lets not talk about those easy modules whereby people score close to full marks to get an A.

Even if you score 10/20 and lost 10% of your grade for midterm, if you work hard and get close to full marks for finals, you are still able to secure ~90% of the grade.

Moral: its definitely possible to get A for the mod even flunking midterms. Maybe not A+. Is it hard to score well for finals? Yes. Is it possible to score well for finals? Yes. Why? You still have half of a semester to do something about it. "

It might be a bold step to ask - and I do still fervently believe in that, regardless of what I have been through - but that doesn't guarantee you a direct reply and you shouldn't use that to encourage you to be bold and ask. In other words, don't be encouraged by the fact that you can open Schrodinger's box once you ask. Only ask when you are sure you want to start a relationship with this person, and put all thoughts of whether this will lead to awkwardness and whatnot aside. A mature question begets a mature response, and if the other party fails to rise up to the occasion, perhaps you wouldn't need an immature friend like this anyway.

I would also like to encourage you that you should not regret not asking her out at all. Because not being with her is the reason you are now happily attached to your girlfriend. Think of it this way, the opportunity is not something you want to have anyway. If you had gotten into a relationship with her, you could have not gotten along and broken up with her by now. If you regret, are you thinking along the lines of ""the relationship could have been better if I were with her instead?"". Drop that unhealthy thought!"
5240,53792,"Hi all, I am having a dilemma on whether to do honours thesis and need some advice. While I would like to do HT for the experience, my CAP is currently a borderline second upper(4.1X). Given that HT is a hefty 15MC, I am afraid that I may screw it up and graduate with a second lower instead. Taking modules would in a sense be safer cos I get to spread out the risk over 3 modules.

5241,53791,"It really annoys me when people say that the newer universities (SIT/SUTD) are better than NUS/NTU/SMU just because they have a higher employment rate. 

The newer schools have higher employment rates because the courses they offer are courses that are in demand in today’s society, such as computing, theraphy, info sys etc.

In contrast, NUS/NTU/SMU offer a greater variety of courses. Some of these courses have traditionally lower employment rate, such as the humanities, music or sciences. Obviously as a whole, the more establised schools would then have a lower employment rate.

If we were to compare the more popular course in NUS with SIT, such as accountancy, chem engineering, NUS’s employment numbers are actually higher. NTU’s number are higher than SIT’s as well. Of course SIT have many other courses that trumps us in employment rate but these courses are mostly not in demand in NTU/NUS in the first place whereas in SIT/SUTD, these courses are all that they have.

Also not to mention that NUS/NTU/SMU have way more students. Of course in terms of employment rate they would be disadvantaged.

Some of the people that made statements about how the newer universities are better suggested that this is attributed to the newer unis having a longer internship/attachement period instead of having a more theoretical teaching approach like the established unis. These people of course do not realise that NUS/NTU/SMU offers students the option to have a longer internship period. Anyway, universities, being acadmias, should be about imparting knowledge and developing and interest in the subject matter, rather than mimicking factories and churning out employees.

Anyway pardon my grammar. I wrote this without proof reading."

Looking at pharm sci 20 cores modules, 13 core modules are identical with pharmacy. 

The 7 non identical modules are: 
a) fyp x 2
b) bioinformatics offered by lsm
c) stats for life sci offered by stats
d) pharmaceutical qm 
e) drug product development and lifecycle
f) lab techniques 


Therefore you could say if you studied pharmacy, but decide to read up on (d), (e), (f), intern at a lab, you can actually more or less cover more of what a pharm sci student do. 

The major disadvantage of pharm sci is you cannnot become a registered pharmacist. Only pharmacy course + pre reg grants you the right. 

Pharm sci career will be focused on sales, regulation and development. Of which, once again being a registered pharmacist would have advantage in sales and regulation. 

For sales, if you go to hosp sell drugs, go to gp land to sell to gp, being a pharmacist may be more trustworthy. Not to say ordinary life sci peeps cant sell, they made good drug reps actually. i have met many great life sci sales reps. trust me they are really good. 

For regulation wise, once again being a registered pharmacist will be advantageous, as you knows how the system works and can intepret clinical studies with ease. 

For development wise is where pharm sci peeps will shine, the medicinal chem knowledge of an average pharmacist is dismal. really they can hardly synthesize anything. some times they cant even recall simple pharmacokinetics eqn and calculate simple things like half life. poor maths skills. lab techniques also very mediocre as the course is clinically oriented. i believe the objective of pharm sci is develop a group of graduates with strong scientific skills for the industry. the current pharmacy course is too clinically oriented and may produce graduates not ideal for the industry. there is simply no way to squeeze the both clinical and scientific components into a 4 yrs course. 

so in general, 
a) if you wanna go clinical route and practicing pharmacist, definitely pharmacy.
b)  if you wanna go development and lab work, definitely pharm sci. the internships and training provided are simply better. Free up clinical time for scientific skills.
c) sales and regulation wise, doesnt really matter coz general life sci (dont even need pharm sci) can do as well.

5271,53740,"There are 4 types of inequality and not all of them are remediable.

2nd type - wealth inequality. If you born in a wealthy family and inherit millions, while I have to pay the debts of my parents, that is wealth inequality 

3rd type- connections inequality. If your dad knows who and who, and you can get a competitive internship in certain firm which translates to a perm job, while I have problem finding internship, that is connections inequality. 

4th type- iq inequality. If you can recall stuff better, good cognitive skills and have iq of 130 while I’m of average iq of 100, that is inequality.

Resubmissions of the same assignment carries a separate penalty for late submissions. Our ideas have to be 'new to the world' and 'radical'. We can try but it seems that this is an avenue to steal ideas from students for future course material.

5290,53711,"Dear G,

After all this time (two and a half years) I never thought you would pop up in my life again like today, in the most unplanned way. Were you surprised? I thought you did when I saw that look in your eyes when you looked up at me. I might have treated you with common courtesy and no acknowledgement of our past acquaintance, but little did you know about the emotional turmoil ensued after you left, until now.

Seeing you again I could not help but thinking back about those two years. It's hard not to find those memories bittersweet. The effortless chemistry from the first day I went to our school, all the crazy coincidences, from life goals to school activity choices to food choices and other small things. All those things that made me think that our fate intertwined somehow, and I didn't know you had the same thought until one year later. All the memories that had been left untouched for years; I thought I would never dig them up from the bottom of my brain again. Yet today I was surprised at how much I still remember. But those memories no longer reduced me to tears, now they only filled me with a bittersweet feeling that has no name.

And I'm also aware that there is a reason, or many reasons, why we ended our relationship. Seeing you today, I was surprised at how many things about you I just could not see back then. I won't go into details, not to undermine you, but I felt relieved not having to be in the same situation as the girl you were with today. 

I apologise if I was cold towards you. Unlike the last time we met three months after the break up during A levels result day, we really have had our own ways this time. You and I have lost contact somewhere along those years and with everything we have gone through, individually, we might as well be strangers by now, with the only thing in common being our past connection. But it is not something we can reminisce and talk about when we meet. Why bring the past up when it does nothing but making us sad and may even affect our current relationships? I no longer know how to talk to you, which is why I could not give you anything more than common politeness.

Funny how as I thought about our encounter today, I kept thinking if this had happened much sooner, closer to our break up, I would certainly have jumped to the conclusion that this is a sign from the universe and heaven above that we should get back together. Now, for many accumulative reasons, seeing you is just like hearing an echo from my past. A past that has so little, if not nothing, to do with my life nowadays. You're probably wondering why I spent so much time writing all this. I know you, like most of our schoolmates, read this page and deny about it irl. I can not carry these thoughts and feelings with me right now, so I have to get it out of my system some way.

Thank you readers if you're still with me until now. What other thoughts do you have upon seeing a (long-lost) ex? (:

Guys, be thankful to what you have in your life. Not everyone has that. I am single, came from another country to develop myself among the best community in Asia.

Having no 'real' friends here yet, I try to enjoy their company to the most. Trust me, they are not even friends according to my definition (every person always got some work, and I am always the one who manages the work to come for their proposed meet). I cannot blame them or tell them that they aren't my good friends, the fact is they are really bad at managing their time. Maybe I am habituated with what I had earlier, my friends from my homeland made me so much dependent on these connections that I still miss them.

I see these beautiful girls here, I feel like having an emotional relationship, and sharing my bed and thoughts with a girl. But as I do not have that (couldn't find THE ONE here, or maybe they didn't me), I try to engage myself traveling to new places most times or trying new things. Obviously, you cannot get everything, I can see that girls aren't interested in me (it's the beard - I have a great European beard which I am not shaving for a girl here). I would love to know some hiking spots here in Singapore.

I love NUS, it has provided me with the best resources in the country: talk about U-Town! You can possibly get the best lifestyle possible here. Gym, Sports, Food, Cafes, Greenery, best residences, everything under some hundred meters. 

Obviously, everyone has negative experiences, even I do -- nobody's living without problems -- it's a sinusoidal wave. But why tell those to people here on a social group who don't even know you and your emotional situation or condition. Instead, talk to your close ones regarding the same. These social groups aren't going to help you. Fking be thankful for what you have! Be happy and be high on euphoria dude. It's that time to develop into something better. This definitely ain't coming back.

PS: NUSWhispers should add another category for such posts. Euphoria will make a good name for the same."

5299,53685,"Reading #53672 on a cool rainswept evening brought back bittersweet memories from a distant past. Many years ago, I too was young and, like many of the youths here, filled with these dilemmas of ""does she like me back"", ""should I ask her"", ""will we work out"", etc. I met this girl at college and we clicked so well and had such similar interests and outlook in life, that our friends always teased us and thought that we were a couple or about to be a couple. We went for meals and movies together, hung out, texted etc but ... I never asked her the question as I was unsure if she liked me back in that way. In a way, I also didn't feel sexually attracted to her and saw her (back then) as more of a sister, although I knew even then that rationally we would have made a great couple as we shared so many similarities in terms of perspectives, temperament, religion, family background etc. 

Life took its course: college ended, we went separate ways at university, and we began to drift apart, though we still kept in touch, visited each other at our halls, and met up during the vacations. We both graduated and got professional jobs. We stayed in touch and met up for dinners on weekends, and even then I hesitated to ask as I was unsure whether she saw me as more than a friend. I also wondered if she would settle for me (despite our similarities, her family situation is slightly better off) and I told myself that I doubted my readiness to commit. Obviously she never asked either.

Seasons passed and one day she told me that she was getting married. Well, I wasn't really surprised of course as she was eligible, and there was no reason to suppose she wouldn't move on in life at some point. I wished her well, although I did not think I wanted to attend the wedding and so I made up an excuse. We did schedule one last meet-up before that, in the presence of her fiance. I was very glad to see at least that he seems a fine young man who will give her the sort of life and happiness that I, a struggling graduate student, would probably not be able to provide. Unlike you, I never got to ask her the question whether she ever felt for me and whether we ever could have worked out if I had asked back then, when we were close. I felt it would have been awkward, and pretty selfish, to ask for the sake of my own closure when she was already engaged, so I simply wished the happy couple well, and I never contacted her again ever since. Also, unlike you, I never found another, and so today the loves of my life are only my immediate family, my work (which I do love a lot), my former students, and the campus cats.

The purpose of writing this is to tell those of you out there, especially the guys, not to overthink and not to hesitate too much in the prime of life. It is easy to make up excuses for not asking and for not taking the friendship a step further, but remember that inaction has consequences too, many of them irreversible. If you want a partner/spouse, you have to go for it, you have to risk some things. Looking at many of the earlier posts expressing doubts and uncertainty on this page I just want to say, from the perspective of one who's been through that phase and unfortunately missed the boat, that:

Young ones shouldn't be afraid 
To live, love 
While the flame is strong 
'Cos we may not be the young ones
Very long"
5300,53684,"There's this common saying in CS or perhaps any other major ""Grades are not everything"", which means ""grades are not that important"" , often said by the people who got good grades. It still doesn't answer the question of ""Are grades important?"" Maybe that is true when you're comparing 2 good scores(4.5 and 4.8), which is somehow like an upper bound for the score you can get. 

However, considering the lower bound now, you happen to be one with a CAP of 3.0(or even struggle to graduate) and you're not good with anything else employers want from you. In that position, would anyone still bother to learn ""extra"" stuff out of their course curriculum that help ""boost their portfolio""? I think not."
5301,53682,"I got rant this off my chest because it sounds pretty ridiculous but is a true story. As much as I like my mother, I really her way of feeding the family to the point she is over feeding and causing my family members to be fat. 

My mum really loves eating and eats a lot in one setting since she does alot of housework, which I find it reasonable. But because of this, she feeds the entire family with her amount and pampers my brother and sister with so many extra food in a meal. 
For instance of a meal, she would get each of us a packet of rice (with extra rice) with 2 meats and 1 tofu, then she will get a bowl of soup and very often will add in more meat or fish separately to share. She also tends to store the fridge with tons of desserts and drinks in case we get hungry and can eat at any point of the day. As a result, both my brother and sister are now severely overweight, my sister can be considered obese now. 

I confronted my mother on many occasions to tell her about this issue, told her that's not how you should feed your children and stop assuming they are still growing when they are already on their early twenties, but she would always be so annoyed and refuted my father and my argument saying its nonsense. Because of that, as much as possible, I begin to shun away to eat with my family and would dabao my own meals since we cannot agree. However, I felt this is causing communication problems and also more importantly, my mum's ignorance is slowly bring my family member's health to danger. 

What should I do?"

5307,53672,"#53672 Thank you for your post, it really reaffirmed my decision in asking my crush out, despite it not ending well. I would say I was in a very similar situation as you, and ended being ghosted and subtly rejected (which I couldn't tell if it was a rejection or that it was a legit reason for quite a long period of time). It was a devastating period of guessing game and constantly picking myself up to try again and ask again. Nevertheless, my crush got attached to someone else after a few semesters of guessing game. While I was sad, it was a relief that the torturous guessing games can finally cease.

Therefore, I would like to add a clause that asking should not come with an expectation of a reply. It might be a bold step to ask - and I do still fervently believe in that, regardless of what I have been through - but that doesn't guarantee you a direct reply and you shouldn't use that to encourage you to be bold and ask. In other words, don't be encouraged by the fact that you can open Schrodinger's box once you ask. Only ask when you are sure you want to start a relationship with this person, and put all thoughts of whether this will lead to awkwardness and whatnot aside. A mature question begets a mature response, and if the other party fails to rise up to the occasion, perhaps you wouldn't need an immature friend like this anyway.

I would also like to encourage you that you should not regret not asking her out at all. Because not being with her is the reason you are now happily attached to your girlfriend. Think of it this way, the opportunity is not something you want to have anyway. If you had gotten into a relationship with her, you could have not gotten along and broken up with her by now. If you regret, are you thinking along the lines of ""the relationship could have been better if I were with her instead?"". Drop that unhealthy thought!"
5308,53671,"Friends. What are friends? Sometimes I wished I was the ignorant one.

Thanks all for the whispers-consensus that we are likely to be just aquaintances than friends. (have to be careful with definitions and confirmation bias)
I'm definitely hoping to look for genuine friends within the same major. However for now, I've decided to settle with this bunch of aquaintances while having friends outside school. Giving them the BOD, and hope the situation might get better. (This might just be an excuse to maintain the status quo. Who knows if I don't know myself?)

But to give you a gist of the situation now: I am shoving out all my thoughts about seeking a friendship where I can say ""I'm bored..how ah?"" with this bunch and just drown myself in studies.

You first saw her in school,
your heart raced whenever she enters your field of vision,

after all that,
you decided you will move on,

as you sat in the library,

#53562, #53581, #53597: There are multiple reasons it could be broken actually, but usually generic parts are available. However, what we're talking about here is not a simple swap. I've never asked the staff at co-op before but I doubt they have the equipment and expertise to do it. (Not saying that they're bad!)

Unfortunately, and this may seem like raising your hopes to dash it again, I don't know of any local third-party repair shops. Maybe someone reading this can suggest?

I can do the repair, but it will probably take a week or more waiting for replacement parts. Again, other nerds can feel free to volunteer if you have the expertise/confidence!



One thing I left out in my original reply to you: The 600-800 you're paying at Apple for the repair goes into them giving you an entirely new logic board. A third-party repair will just replace the small tiny components on your old logic board that broke.

Let me break that down for you: In both cases, your original issue will be fixed, and has the same (hopefully low) chance of recurring again. However, for the third-party option, you still have the accumulated risk of other things breaking down with age, since you are still using your old logic board.

So it is up to you to decide whether spending the 600-800 on the official repair is worth:
1. A firmer repair schedule
2. Practically getting a partial refurbishment of your mac
3. Proper liability coverage in case the same issue happens again in 1 month

I usually sit through almost all of my lectures without even absorbing anything; basically wasting 2-3 hours of my day each time sitting there like an idiot.

This handicap has put me lagging tremendously far down compared to all my peers.

I'm like in an entirely different timezone.
And of course it's even worse when CP marks are involved which basically amounts to a test of whoever can think up of something to say the fastest.

This slow rate of thinking is so slow, I can't even grasp simple conversations with friends at times or instructions for say, an orientation game. It really makes me look like a fool to everyone most of the time when I'm actually not.

Sometimes, I don't even know how I made it to NUS to begin with. I guess my only redeeming factor is that with enough time I can grasp the knowledge, and that's only how I managed to always score well in exams.

One thing I left out in my original reply to you: The 600-800 you're paying at Apple for the repair goes into them giving you an entirely new logic board. A third-party repair will just replace the small tiny components on your old logic board that broke.

Let me break that down for you: In both cases, your original issue will be fixed, and has the same (hopefully low) chance of recurring again. However, for the third-party option, you still have the accumulated risk of other things breaking down with age, since you are still using your old logic board.

So it is up to you to decide whether spending the 600-800 on the official repair is worth:
1. A firmer repair schedule
2. Practically getting a partial refurbishment of your mac
3. Proper liability coverage in case the same issue happens again in 1 month

I've blocked most of them (unfortunately I simply deleted the initial requests before I realised) but it feels more of a reactive rather than a preventive measure. I've since removed all trace of my identity on Tumblr, which initially had posts linked to my Instagram account, but they're still finding me. Changing my url didn't work as Tumblr will somehow link your account. I'm not sure how effective changing my Instagram handle will be, given that my name is in my handle and I've removed my account from the place where this all started. They have even found me on Carousell, a very localised app, which made me fear for my safety, given that most people only stalk on social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. To add to this mess, I have been badly affected by the recent Facebook security incident, and am afraid my information can be used to impersonate or stalk me even further.

5383,53556,"When I was a kid, my parents taught me the same formula for success that most of us probably learned: go to school, study hard, and get good grades so you can get a safe, secure, high-paying job with benefits and your job will take care of you. Later in my life I came to realize that this education system is not bolstering my skills, knowledge and abilities, rather it has limited my opportunities and understanding. This whole education system taught us the blueprint for working for others, serving others, and making them rich through our hard work.

Have we ever thought where will this outdated education system lead us? What will be our future? I can assure most peoples’ future if they keep following this system. We will be working for other, making them attain their financial success through our hard works. If we ask students “why do you join institution, college or university?”, we often hear the same answer- to get a good and secure job in a big company or a renowned employer. My concern here is not what is the answer but whose is that answer. Going to university and getting a degree with good grades to get a secure job with benefits is actually not their own personal opinion. Most of us are so brainwashed by our society and authority that we should go college to secure our future. Our educational system and culture train us, from the cradle to the grave, to follow this obsolete pattern that worked a century before.

This education system has implanted, in our brain, a solid formula to obediently follow authority that is damaging our own future. Yes, it has taught us how to earn money but not how to make money. There is a great difference between earning money and making money. I believe earning money means getting a paycheck from an employer by working for them. Paycheck is actually trading our time for money. We get paid per hour of our service and work. But don’t get me wrong here, I’m not saying employment is a bad thing. I’m just saying it’s only one way of generating income, and one that is extremely limited.
We all see our live from our own core values. Some people may love being employees, while others hate it. Some people love owning companies, but do not want to run them. Certain people love investing, while others see only the risk of losing money. Most of us are a little of each of these characters. I believe we all have our own goals and I categorized these goals into two types: social success and financial success. Social success means gaining reputations through service while financial success means making money and live the life we want to live. We all are running for any of these two things. But we are not sure whether we are able to achieve it or not.

I don’t mean you have to quit your college to attain your future. I only mean don’t fall in the trap of this education system that will lead us nowhere than to works as a slave for others. Who will you blame for your future? Authority? Society? No, it’s all our fault, our weaknesses because we and only we have the power to take control and determine our destiny. The only way for all of us to have a genuinely secure future is to take control of our future. For that, we have to change our mindsets because what is in our head will be in our hand. First, we have to choose our destiny and feed only the things that will take us closer to that destiny rather than following the formula that are deep-seated in our brain by someone else.

But here lies the most tragic thing, we all know that this education system has ruined us and will lead us to nowhere than to make other peoples’ dream come true. So why don’t we take the actions? Why don’t we change our way of thinking? Why don’t we alter our pattern? The reason is because we don’t believe ourselves. Yes, the one thing that hold all of us back to go against this pattern is some degree of self-doubt and fear because these are the greatest distraction of our personal genius. So, if we want to control our life and destiny, if we want real freedom, freedom to set our own schedules, spend time with friends and families, doing the thing we love to do, living the life we want to live and we are designed to live- a life of passion, excitement, fulfillment and success then it’s the time to pack all of our stuffs and move on towards our destiny."

I am just too awkward to talk to others properly in real life. Picture Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory but way worse than him, at least he has close friends. 

When I try to talk to others in real life, they shun me because I think they find me obnoxious because everything I say seems so closed and kind of leave them no room to answer (even when I don't intend to), sometimes I try to talk to people but words come out at the weirdest timings so it seems like I am interrupted their conversations, or I talk about the most retarded things...

5390,53549,"I love to (try to) lead and organize events for other people. I love reading and applying for online courses to supplement my learning. I love bundling commitments after commitments to get myself busy.

But the biggest problem is, I don't follow through ANYTHING that I set myself to do at the start. As a leader, I slacken off, start ponning exco meetings, doing less work than I'd promised, and not constantly being ""on the ball"" as what I know is expected of an exco member. 

I have probably close to forty ""started but gave up somewhere at the start/in the early middle"" Coursera/EdX  courses stuck in my bookmark somewhere, that I'm either too lazy or unmotivated to click to continue learning. Then I forget everything and it's pretty much useless to continue anymore, and I just delete that bookmark.

Commitment-wise, I do just a bit of everything - it's quantity over quality, but I simply love that. I'm a faster learner, and I can get things done pretty well, but I'm just so lazy to motivate myself to do anything at home. When I should be planning for the next major event/delegate tasks to my juniors/commence e-learning/practise that piece for a duet performance with my friend/prepare tuition materials for my next student, I end up procrastinating and just browsing the web, having a good laugh with Season 5's Brooklyn, dating, etc etc...

I honestly don't know if this phenomena is actually normal, or I'm really really bad at following through commitments. I write my to-do lists that go neglected, that evolve from ""daily"" tasks to ""weekly"" tasks and then to ""just do them sometime this lifespan"" tasks. If I had better motivation, I'm very sure I would be able to do so much more, but I just don't see the point of a lot of things. Makes me feel that if I don't see something immediately tangible come out of it, I don't immediately recognize the need and drive to do it.

5393,53538,"I have a good friend who is rich, not in terms of money, but in non-material terms, like kindness, generosity, experience, advice etc. He is very street-savvy and knows the best places to go to have a good time, and he enjoys bringing us along to these places. He finds it fulfilling to be sharing these riches with his friends, and I have been a fairly frequent recipient, and I'm super grateful to him for that.

I've been on the receiving end so much so I'm very willing to reciprocate the same qualities back to him. Unfortunately this is where I get annoyed, because he is very disinterested with whatever I provide him? For example when I try to give him well-intentioned advice, he starts getting defensive, as if an outsider's opinion is always inferior to his own opinions.

When I give him food/books recommendations, he drifts off to lala land and then comes back momentarily to give me a few polite nods. Sometimes he tries to one-up me by saying he knows an even better place, or an even better book, and insinuates I should stop assuming that I know more than him, because obviously he's the one who's more savvy right. And obviously we've never been to any place which I would recommend because of how uninterested he is, and he'd suggest a different place, and we end up going to that place.

Am I thinking too much if I conclude that his reason for being so generous with his ""riches"" is primarily to show off what he has, and less because he genuinely wants to share them with the people that matter to him? He's such a good giver, and I try my best to be a good receiver. I try my best to be a good giver, but he's such a bad recipient and he's not even trying.

I have no intentions to break off this friendship, but I'm thinking of voicing my concerns with him. But I'm afraid his defensive nature might come out again and then it might permanently affect this friendship. He can be quite temperamental. I've seen him raise his voice and express his anger publicly before, at the slightest of offences. It's funny because I genuinely admire his savviness and grateful for his generosity, but at the same time fearful of his temperament and defensiveness. What should I do??

I'm overloading MCs, juggling three clubs, and doing part-time work, and it is nearly unmanageable. I never have a day where I don't have late/delayed tasks, and my social life is nonexistent outside of the clubs. And I still feel extremely worried about being employable. 

I think it is also getting to me that many employers only seem to want Year 3s for their internships, and I'm only Year 1. But I am told that I need internship experience now right now, because employers prefer interns with prior internship experience. It's a Catch-22, and I get very bitter at peers who escape this paradox by using family connections. My close friend has a lawyer as her dad, so she got a law internship she isn't at all qualified for-- and she didn't even help me, so I still can't stop resenting her. 

My parents still caution me about two relatives who are roundly shamed by everyone in the family for being ""useless"", because one of them changed majors halfway through uni life, and the other was unemployed for a year.

5438,53438,"To #53396: While most of the commenters are painting rosy pictures about people with mental conditions or guilt-tripping you, I've actually been there and done that. As all mental conditions are not the same (and many have multiple conditions apart from just autism), I would really urge you to evaluate the seriousness of it before committing. 

At first, he was a sweet guy (with Asperger's), just socially awkward. As we dated, I started realising he has moods. Sometimes he would be 'normal', but other times he would be frustrated and lash out at people. It's like unpredictable PMS. Then when he realised that he could get away with it by blaming it on his mental conditions, our relationship took a turn for the worse.

The mental condition might be real, but it is no excuse for some of the things he had done. Violence and abuse is wrong, regardless if I'm on my period or someone has autism. Sometimes  you might be tempted to give him a chance because of his condition, or that it is 'not really' him, but I accepted that this IS part of him. We may never be able to tell apart what is his 'true character' and what is his condition, but either way it's simple.

Love  yourself first, if it works for you go for it. If it doesn't, then don't. Don't be biased either way.

In the end I broke it off, as I could not live with him anymore. Note, I did not say I could not live with his condition. Since it is a permanent condition, they are effectively one and the same. "

OK, at this point, she sort of duped me into the rs but it's fine. I got her out, told her that I respect her views but it's not gonna work between us, give her the whole ""it's not you it's me"" talk, which is quite true and reflective of the situation, and we broke off.

He has never ever said that i'm pretty nor has he ever praised me before..

5467,53388,"Just a rant here after reading an assortment of posts and misogynistic comments. Apologies for the length (pun intended). 

Honestly, your dick size should not generally have that much influence on how much love and affection your girl has for you (anomalies do apply of course). 

What matters from what what i’ve Observed, at least on the sex perspective, is how you treat your girl.  Do you love and respect her? Do you reciprocate? As cliched as this sounds, and it probably does, are you a good partner? Do you try to be that guy whom she feels safe, cherished and happy with? Are you the understanding and supportive partner who encourages her to partake in activities like a part-time job, even though it might potentially result in less time for the both of you, because you KNOW it’s for her own good? Or are you that asshole who insists on gratification at the expense of her discomfort? Are you that selfish partner who lies in bed, expecting to be pleasured and then assume that she’d be alright with settling herself? Are you that jerk who insists on sex every time, be it via guilt tripping, pleading or forcing, you must have your girl pleasure you, even when she’s uncomfortable, like if she’s on her period? 

Some of my buddies hate giving oral but love receiving it. Where’s the fairness in that? They claim it’s disgusting; it’s tiring...to hell with All that. Your girl puts up with the same shit by sucking and licking yours, is it too much to ask to reciprocate? Worse still for those who force their partners to do certain things; let insisting to cum in their mouth. Don’t get me wrong, it feels awesome and it’s so satisfying, some times it’s even better than sex. If they like it, good for you! But if they don’t, WTF do you still insist? 

It might sound like it doesn’t matter, but a little consideration and care goes a long way. I love my girlfriend, and even at the expense of being teased by my mates that i’m whipped or that I can afford to be more demanding, i’d still stick with what I do now. I’m happy that she’s happy, i’m glad that she enjoys sex as much as I do. Be that partner she deserves; be that partner she’s proud of. If you can’t respect that, then it doesn’t matter what size dick you have, you’ll always be that shit partner who’s not only bad in the sack, but also a terrible, jerk-ass boyfriend. Don’t blame her for dumping your ass, blame yourself for being one.

5470,53385,"I am an alumni who has graduated sometime within the last decade (keeping it ambiguous). Didn't do well at all, even failed a core module during my first year, but somehow I graduated with a less-than-average CAP. Somehow I was offered a job (even though it was a couple of months after almost everyone), and somehow I am still working in the same profession as what I did. For that I ought to count myself lucky.

Fast forward (x years later) to recently, I was considering options to do postgraduate [coursework] studies (open to both local and overseas) either next year or the year after, and unfortunately quite a good number of postgraduate courses from the overseas universities strongly suggest that I require a good CAP (which I obviously don't), and a submission of (usually a minimum of) 3 letters of recommendation, (most if not all) from professors/academia. I seriously doubt any of the professors even remembered that I took their module(s) several semesters ago, and I don't expect them to. These two requirements really make me feel like I regret not making the best to do better or make smarter decisions back then, even though I had always made myself think that I don't regret the things I did (and only regretted the ones that I never got the chance to).

I am envious at my fellow classmates that went further and have the greener grasses now. The chances of me ever following the footsteps, even if I were to give myself a few more years, seem bleak now...

5491,53351,"#53336 To Mr. P.

I broke up with you because you were just as unaccommodating. I accommodated you, went over to your workplace on the other side of Singapore, went to school on holidays to see you because you were ""busy"", went over to your place a fair amount of times, only for you to continue working and ignore me in all of the times I listed above.

I know your design degree is tough. I know your workload is heavy. I didn't complain because I knew you were working hard for your submission. When you graduated last year, I was truly happy for you. I wanted to bring you out for dinner after commencement, but what did you say? You told me that you wanted to go out with your friends. So I relented, it's going to be the last time in a while you'll see them. But for the entire month afterward, you didn't want to meet. You wanted me to come over because you were ""tired"". You were at home, your insta story shows you cleaning your fish bowl and you tell me you're tired? After you started working, it was impossible to get a hold of you at all. You were always at the office, on weekends too. My friends in your firm tell me your schedule is nowhere near as hectic as you make it out to be. You tell me inspections last till 6pm? My friends' instastories show you and them knocking off at 3pm. You wanted to know how I know? Now you do.

I work part-time. I can't leave work until 1, and your house is on the other end of the purple line to my workplace and my house. You never want me to stay for dinner. I've never met your mother, or your father in the one and a half years we were together. And the one time I came over after work, I arrived at 3, and you chased me out before 4 because we were done having sex. I'm your girlfriend, not a call girl. That entire incident made me think you're just with me for the sex. And you ask why I don't initiate sex?

Despite all these things, you never once gave me any help. My parents are strongly religious, and you are a ""free thinker"". When you come over, you don't talk to them, and you keep quiet when they try to talk to you. Think for me, I begged you, don't put me in a spot. But you told me that ""I am the way I am, your parents are just going to have to accept it"". So I stopped inviting you over. 

I got angry at you choosing to show up at our date half an hour late, without any warning. I got angry at you ignoring my texts and calls. I got angry at you happily texting another girl while I was talking to you and you didn't pay ANY attention to me for the whole date. Are all of these things ""small things"" to you? You complain and guilt trip me when I text my male friends, but somehow because it's you, you can text members of the opposite sex just fine?

I'm needy for meeting once a week? You never want to do anything, and if we go over to your place, you'll just be playing your games, after you ask me for sex and I decline. Of course I'll ask you to go somewhere else, if not you'll just spend your time ignoring me.

You complain to me about everything and I lend a listening ear, but you won't listen to my problems, telling me that ""it's nothing la"" and ""like that only?"". I open up to you and you dismiss my concerns? You'd rather watch your videos than listen to me talk? How disrespectful can you get?

I've raised breaking up with you many times. This breakup was a long time coming. Each time I chose to give you another chance, but you didn't make good on it. My friends told me that you were egotistical and selfish, and that's why they told me to break up with you. I guess they were right. Why the hell would you want to be introduced to them anyway? You think all my friends are ""rabak"" anyway.

This new guy? I got together with him a couple months later, not a week. Don't exaggerate like you always do. He's patient, unlike you, and he tries to work things through. He's not religious, but he tries to show respect. He talks to me. He accommodates me, and so I am more than willing to repay the favour. He's everything you never were.

I'm very happy with him. I hope you find happiness too.

Yours Sincerely,
M.

Admins, please at least allow me to clear my name."
5492,53349,"To OP of #53336,

Here are some free advice for you: I just broke up with someone, who has a very similar view of the world like you. Blame blame blame blame and blame again. Because it is easier to choose to blame someone else. Somehow everything about the relationship has to be about your own needs first, putting your own face, your own wounds, your own idea of how the relationship should be like first. 

I'm sorry to break news to you, that the world does not revolve around you. Well, at least not your ex-girlfriend. She doesn't owe you ANYTHING for her decisions. Even for things that you think you have done for her or for the relationship, please take some accountability and claim those 'things' as YOUR OWN DECISIONS. You can choose to love someone, but you cannot blame her if it doesn't work out. It's not her fault. Sometimes she is not just the right person for you, and you have to accept that. 

Have you ever taken a serious look at your past relationships?  Why did they fail? What did you do? What did you say? How many times during an arguement, that you sincerely took responsibility for what you said or did, and held yourself accountable for it? You can play the victim card, but nobody is going to pity you. Because we all see through your lies. Well, at least I'm referring to myself, who is a stranger online who doesn't even know you. And the other people commenting on that post.

From your confession, it seems like you haven't been able to move on yet. I can empathise with you on that, but i can only offer advice here. Which is to re-evaluate your priorities in life. What do you want to do in your life? What is important to you? How do you plan to get there? How important was your girlfriend to you, and how was she supporting you towards your dreams? If she isn't as great as you hoped to be, then let's just use this to cut her off completely. Stop looking at her social media accounts and let yourself​ go. Because you deserve someone who can support you and your dreams.

Hope you are able to recover well and take care."

Yet, it was so difficult to fall asleep when I tried to go to bed earlier (even at 1 a.m.) that I gave up trying to do so and started sleeping even later. Most of the times I'm not even doing work, just using the computer for entertainment. Furthermore, I may have some anxiety issues that makes me treasure my nighttime much more that I don't feel like wasting it by sleeping early. This seems to be a vicious cycle to me."

However, going through the whole process this year, I felt that there are alot of things that the overall committee involved in IFG that can work upon.

Firstly, I do not think it is wise to use the ""backdoor"" approach to get people into committee, as you end up forming cliques and make others in your committee feel left out beyond the superficial fact of just being in a committee. What happen to openess and inclusivity?

Next, why is it necessary for Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson to be in every chat that exist anyway? Isnt the hierarchical structure already there to ensure work is done efficiently? Why must we allocate Sports Club MC to be the PD of different cells anyway? Capability to match up the role cannot be purely by who is in MC and who is not what!

Lastly, why is the structure of comm so segregated, almost like there is little interaction among the different comm. I mean we are one committee, would it not be necessary to know each other more to work better together? We all joined IFG for a reason, why the separation anyway?

Sports Club, while I respect your dedication and hard work, please make some good changes and work on all these problems or a lot of others will suffer unnecessarily for it"

5537,53278,"I was struck by how many people relish loading their speech with the word “like”. I Googled about the phenomenon and found this on Quora:

Q: Why do people use the word ""like"" as a filler word? How did it spread so quickly when it makes us sound so unintelligent?

A: Because, like, you can put it, like, pretty much, like, anywhere, and it like, makes you seem, like, casual. (Actually not quite everywhere.) It's also a hesitation word (like um), and functions as a sort of, like, disclaimer that you're uncertain about your choice of words.

A clever answer. I hope practitioners, professional or unconscious amateur, of this manner of speech will seriously reflect on what they have been doing to themselves and their listeners. Are there books, sacred manuals or empirical studies that suggest this way of speaking -- using “like” so indiscriminately -- “sounds so unintelligent”, as the Quora user puts it? I don’t think any serious academic could say anything about intelligence in this context, but otherwise, under two approaches to language: the prescriptive and proscriptive, the (slightly exaggerated but telling) passage you have read above definitely reminds me of a spreading linguistic malady.

Prescriptivist is defined as “believing that there are correct and wrong ways to use language and that books about language should give rules to follow, rather than describing how language is really used.” It is a position, as far as I know, that few outside the English language department of schools would voluntarily advocate. Most people are “nonchalants” with descriptivist (the opposite of prescriptivist) inclinations, people who simply don’t care or believe that we should all embrace language as it is really used, rather than giving rules to follow saying what is correct and not correct. 

When you hear people using bad speech (to the extent you believe it matters), and yet don’t want to inform them outright, what is the recourse? The proscriptivist -- someone who tries to restrict or forbid -- can help. As a soft proscriptivist (I try not to forbid), let me lay out some reasonable positions on the word “like”: 

▮ I’m for the restriction of the word “like” used in speech as an excuse to not think or carefully select words to advance a point or argument clearly and accurately. 
▮ I’m for the restriction of the word “like” used to make a factual claim that should be conveyed with minimum ambiguity, or used in an attempt to equate one’s subjective feelings with objective facts. 
▮ I’m for the moderate use of filler words such as “like” (and “Um/er/uh”, “actually/basically/seriously”, “I guess/I suppose/ I feel” as well) especially in a time-constrained conversation or discussion where participants aim to learn as much as possible, because the use of such words or phrases necessarily dilutes and reduces the weight of every sentence and consequently entire speeches. 

The reasons for my position are self-evident. “Like” is becoming an absolute cliche, both as a word and chime. The novelist Martin Amis reminds us about “clichés of the mind and clichés of the heart”: when we slump into “herd-words and herd-phrases,” those “rhymes, chimes, repetitions, obscurities, dishonesties, vaguenesses” that come so easily to mind, we abdicate our responsibility to the hard work of original thinking, and abandon our claim to original thought. Clichés are the path to prejudice and intolerance, to ignorance and indoctrination.”

I urge everyone to approach the rampant user of “like” not with a summons or traffic ticket but with a wary eye for the imminent crash -- of a potentially refreshing and intellectually rewarding conversation. Do not follow their manner of speech because their style seems vogue and cool, or conveys a casualness that you admire. If there is a casual coolness or niftiness about him or her, it is definitely not because he has proven capable of wielding the word “like” as a weapon of cliché but something else. Look out for qualities of freshness and energy and emulate those instead. By adopting good speech and habits of mind ourselves, we restrict the space for bad ones.

Add to that the various clothes that are designed to give the illusion of a certain shape like leggings that go all the way to the waist or accessories like neutral glasses that make your eyes look bigger and it’s hard to believe you are doing it out of some great philosophical love for aesthetics. That’s why when one comes across a woman who has minimal makeup or is without it it’s admirable.

Our volunteer cat feeders, both guys and girls, take care of the resident cats at UTown and you may have seen us doing the rounds with our containers of cat food. Most of us do not claim to be 'cat lovers', but we search for and attend to the campus cats every day with our own time and at our own expense, so action speaks louder than words. I am sure that most of us, and certainly myself, would be happy to speak to genuine enquirers about the volunteer feeder programme and what we do, but that does not mean we are even remotely interested in hitting on you. We are ordinary members of the student community and we have our own significant others - even fiances in some cases - and of course we have our own studies to attend to.

So please do not tar the feeder community with the same brush due to the actions of one individual who, as far as I know, is not even part of the volunteer feeders. Feel free to say hello or to chat with us regarding the campus cats - you can keep a safe distance if you wish, being cat people, we're used to dealing with skittishness!

Add to that the various clothes that are designed to give the illusion of a certain shape like leggings that go all the way to the waist or accessories like neutral glasses that make your eyes look bigger and it’s hard to believe you are doing it out of some great philosophical love for aesthetics. That’s why when one comes across a woman who has minimal makeup or is without it it’s admirable. If you are so irritated with men’s attitude why don’t  you look into why so many girls feel so insecure and what role do cosmetic companies and social media websites play in fostering it?

5640,53124,"Anyone here has exes that turned a bit psycho after y'all broke up? 

I have.

Funny thing was, the breakup was mutual. We both knew we'd be better off without each other, with someone else. It was a peaceful one, one where both of us finally accepted the fact in silence. I thought we could remain as distant friends after that, but somehow he acted really coldly and rather rude towards me. At that point in time, I was just taken aback but just shrugged it off; I mean if he doesn't want to be friends, what else could I do, right?

What's even funnier was that I actually still felt really thankful for the relationship even after we broke up. I mean, it wasn't all that good, but we had our good times. I tried really hard to solve the problems we had, and so did he. Just because we failed to keep our relationship didn't mean that it wasn't valid for the past few years. 

The funniest of all is that he actually started to talk shit about me in front of our friends, and his family. The thing is, none of them are even true, he twisted the truth such it was unrecognisable from the original events that happened, just to paint me in a bad light and make people think that I was the crazy one. Like, I never ever expected these actions to come from him. Maybe there were things I didn't know about him, perhaps I did not understand him that well, but this is about one's moral character, which is something I 100% trusted he had. 

Boy am I glad that I ran far away from someone like that. It's so scary how someone can just change 180 degrees suddenly. "

5650,53108,"#53085: couples, especially married couples don't drift apart because of a single cause. It's more likely to be one thing on top of another that build up over time. The only way to stop this is for one of the two to immediately realise it very early on and fix it. If it has gone on for that long, one side start finding sex elsewhere, and the other side despite knowing it, ignore and/or find fun of their own, then probably only a real miracle will reverse it. If your father was the sole breadwinner, then it makes it impossible for your mother to divorce him. A divorce would end up costing your father more (in terms of alimony and suddenly without a woman to do all the cookings and chores [you can hire people to do that but it cost a lot]), so the current arrangement works for both of them, in a rather twisted way.

Think about kicking him out for a moment: can you support yourself and your mother financially? Probably not. Does he love you? What happiness can you bring him? Most parents love their child unconditionally, especially so if the children make their parents proud. A whiny child draws irks from the parents. Unhappily married parents don't like their children very much (since the child has the hated person's blood)."

5657,53096,"I'm not sure if this has ever been suggested, but I'd leave it here for all to consider.

Recall back to your primary and secondary school days when there were four academic terms in a year. Each term had its own assessments for a few topics from each subject syllabus. Having the tests bite-sized helped us enjoy studying and focused better throughout each term.

We do have Special Terms now and I'm sure there are good reasons why the two Special Terms aren't combined to make a Special Semester.

Perhaps, the teaching period could be modified to become two-term in place of a semester. Delivery for a typical 4MC module can span 6 weeks, and then ends with a Term Exam to conclude the module. For modules such as FYP, of course, it can continue to run through 2 terms, that's fine.

On the average, single major undergraduates would then offer 10MCs per term, with fewer gaps between lessons from the same module, through which students and faculty can achieve a seamless teaching and learning experience. This would also help us the students retain knowledge as a result of more focused attention on a particular module. On a side note, having 4 terms instead of 2 semesters also help reduce course bidding problems and  helps provide greater flexibility!

There's already so much pressure surrounding body image for women (I'm not saying men don't have any at all, but the pressure to look ""pretty"" seems to be more disproportionately present among women) and men like you come along adding fuel to it. What's wrong with wearing makeup to help with self-confidence? In my own personal experience I used to think I was horribly ugly and that nothing but plastic surgery could change me, but with makeup I've realised that I can be pretty when I want to. Red lipstick can make one feel powerful and for me makes me feel a lot more put together. At least we put in a lot of effort to take care of ourselves. Make-up isn't only worn just to please you and/or straight men. Most of us humans are not blessed with naturally ""perfect"" appearances, and I'm 90% sure you aren't the next Singaporean Adonis with a jawline carved by the gods either (if you are, congrats on the genetic lottery I guess). Don't insult the hard work that others put into themselves, and make it seem as if girls are vain for trying to look good just because we don't roll out of bed and straight to school like (most) guys do. If you continue with this misogynistic attitude towards makeup, don't worry, the girls with thick makeup also don't want you.

(Sorry if this sounds like a disorganised SJW rant. I'm not usually the kind to start drama over the Internet, but as a girl, a makeup hobbyist and a friend to many other girls who are constantly trying their best to look good everyday, I can't help but angry at this kind of attitude. Seriously, @ men, it's not attractive.

Put yourself out there to experience new things, talk to people about what you want to do, then you would realise what is practicable and whether you had over-idealised your dream. That's why doing shadowing and volunteering may help. If you can envision yourself working in that setting in the future, you would be more motivated to continue pursuing the dream.

For me, at this point, closing in on graduation, I start to see the possible job prospects should I graduate from my current course. I start to waver a little considering how I may still find something suitable for me in this industry if I ultimately don't do medicine. I have come to terms with the fact that while Medicine is my first choice, there are many other ways I can contribute to a good cause with my skillsets. My 'backup plan' is to work with NGOs after getting some years of work experience, so I am currently quite at peace with myself should I not obtain admittance to med school. Anyway, no med school means I get a life. If you think that life is hard now, it may be worse in med school, so there is nothing to 'complain' about at this stage.

While the future seems bleak, while 4 years may seem like a long wait, be at peace with yourself and live your life to the fullest. I understand your worry and anxiety as I was where you were.

Guys need to have a greater sense of dignity, and that does mean knowing when to pull the plug on the friendship when it's become clear the girl is using him. Friendship is a two-way street, and even if we all did believe it were possible to remain friends in the face of a one-sided crush, there are ways the party who's not interested can let the other party down easy and continue the friendship. But it'll come as no surprise that just like in the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"", guys and girls can rarely if ever just be friends. The only way is probably if they're both dating other people, or both would never consider each other. But more often than not, feelings from one party will develop over time, quite often unreciprocated. The sooner we accept this truth, the sooner we can all guard our hearts and not get hurt. Move on to another girl who you might actually have a chance with? And unfortunately, it does mean distancing yourself from the girl who's been stringing you along all this while - she does not deserve your friendship. Also, if we could all learn how not to lead people on (by being more conscious of signals from the other side, and knowing how to signal back), we'd save everyone a lot of heartache. "

Why police the residents so much, if no one causes any actual trouble why are they cruisin for a bruisin, looking to start shit?

All these people had to do was stay at home. They could be spending quality time with their family, binging a miniseries, doing actual work, whatever.

Hear someone causing a ruckus? Residents complain to you about inappropriate decorations or behavior? One dude's shoes blocking half the damn corridor? Please, go ahead and be a hero. It'll make the college a better place to live.

The interview only lead you to be a working slave for the rest of your life. 4 years of your time, could spend on learning more useful stuffs, like family planning, how CPF works, how to buy HDB, buying investment products like stock, reit, future, etc. Only doing business and investment, will lead you to a better life.

5697,53037,"In respnse to #53037: All too often we've heard similar stories wrt ""platonic"" guy-girl friendships - guys always being ""second fiddle"" with a girl that has apparently decided that he will never be good enough but strings him along anyway for a sense of emotional security. Guys need to have a greater sense of dignity, and that does mean knowing when to pull the plug on the friendship when it's become clear the girl is using him. Friendship is a two-way street, and even if we all did believe it were possible to remain friends in the face of a one-sided crush, there are ways the party who's not interested can let the other party down easy and continue the friendship. But it'll come as no surprise that just like in the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"", guys and girls can rarely if ever just be friends. The only way is probably if they're both dating other people, or both would never consider each other. But more often than not, feelings from one party will develop over time, quite often unreciprocated. The sooner we accept this truth, the sooner we can all guard our hearts and not get hurt. Move on to another girl who you might actually have a chance with? And unfortunately, it does mean distancing yourself from the girl who's been stringing you along all this while - she does not deserve your friendship. Also, if we could all learn how not to lead people on (by being more conscious of signals from the other side, and knowing how to signal back), we'd save everyone a lot of heartache. "

5704,53029,"@ #53029 Why are you shaming girls who wear ""thick"" makeup? There's already so much pressure surrounding body image for women (I'm not saying men don't have any at all, but the pressure to look ""pretty"" seems to be more disproportionately present among women) and men like you come along adding fuel to it. What's wrong with wearing makeup to help with self-confidence? In my own personal experience I used to think I was horribly ugly and that nothing but plastic surgery could change me, but with makeup I've realised that I can be pretty when I want to. Red lipstick can make one feel powerful and for me makes me feel a lot more put together. At least we put in a lot of effort to take care of ourselves. Make-up isn't only worn just to please you and/or straight men. Most of us humans are not blessed with naturally ""perfect"" appearances, and I'm 90% sure you aren't the next Singaporean Adonis with a jawline carved by the gods either (if you are, congrats on the genetic lottery I guess). Don't insult the hard work that others put into themselves, and make it seem as if girls are vain for trying to look good just because we don't roll out of bed and straight to school like (most) guys do. If you continue with this misogynistic attitude towards makeup, don't worry, the girls with thick makeup also don't want you.

(Sorry if this sounds like a disorganised SJW rant. I'm not usually the kind to start drama over the Internet, but as a girl, a makeup hobbyist and a friend to many other girls who are constantly trying their best to look good everyday, I can't help but angry at this kind of attitude. Seriously, @ men, it's not attractive. Heck, it would be extra attractive if you went the extra mile and noticed say, my winged eyeliner, shows you take an interest to the girl's interests and not look down on it as if female hobbies are 'lesser' than male hobbies.

5723,52999,"Dear RVRC,

The intent is to provide residents with a sense of pride and accomplishment for gaining more demerit points.

As for number of points, we selected initial values based upon data from the random number generator and other adjustments made to milestone points before giving them out freely. Among other things, we're looking at average per-resident demerit points rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that residents have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via offences.

We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on NUSWhispers, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.

Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.

5725,52997,"I am a year 2 science student currently residing in RVRC, and in light of the supposedly negative confessions on the college, I just want to highlight a few things on the college.

1. Yes, to some extent the demerit system here is a bit harsh. Some offences indeed are not worthy of demerit points. Perhaps the issue is with the Resident Fellow (?) and not the college itself. Come on we are all adults at least respect our privacy. Just pray that you get to stay in the tower block like me if you are an incoming freshman looking to stay on campus.

2. Flag days, Walk for rice, International Coastal cleanups, other events etc which require you to wake up 7am, wear the purple RV shirts and have your Saturdays burned. Yes these events are kinda boring, compulsory, waste of time, etc. But before you even applied you should have did some research that these are just some of the college requirements to fulfill, and RVRC focuses on sustainability. Not as if they expect you to commit to a few CCAs like in the residential halls to earn your stay for year 2 in beyond. So just suck it up.

3. Central location. Need I say even more? 5 minute walk to the exam venues, 7 minute walk to Science (And Yes, there is sheltered pathway from RVRC all the way to science S16) and compared to the people staying in UTown we actually have it easy. No need to worry about squeezing on the campus buses.

4. Some of the hate towards RVRC on NUSWhispers is unjustified. Read the other related RVRC posts with a pinch of salt."

5730,52992,"Hi NUS,
On another note, RV requires students to complete a module, and 2 forums (~12hours each), all of which amount to 0 MCs, students can get the RV certificate. For seniors in RVRC, the senior year programme was not developed yet when we entered the college, as it was just transitioning into a two-year programme. We were only told that there would be forums, which we expected not to be intensive, due to it being non-credit bearing. This year, we were newly informed that each forum comprises multiple sessions, adding up to around 12 hours. All non-credit bearing.

For prospective freshmen, do take this piece of information into consideration, if you are interested in applying for an RC academic programme. Consider VERY CAREFULLY"
5731,52991,"Dear NUS,
Once again, this is another post about RVRC. As a student from RVRC, I cannot deny that there are benefits to staying at this residence. It is conveniently located near to several faculties, and right across the road from the examination halls.

Initially, RVRC struck me as a down-to-earth college that was peaceful and suitable for an introverted person like myself. I used to be proud of being part of the RC and was somewhat glad that I was re-directed to this college instead of the UTown college I had originally applied for.

Well, not anymore. 

I believe that those who disagree with the influx of complaints on NUSWhispers are those who have not heard stories directly from peers who have been unfairly treated, or who have not had close dealings with the RVRC management. Over the time I spent in the RC, I heard many stories from direct sources about the management's antics (both small and large scale) which has soured my opinion of them.

Examples of unfair treatment would be when some students had a particular RF barge into their rooms, for trivial reasons such as having more than a pair of shoes outside their doors. Or other students who experienced having their doors knocked and then immediately opened by that RF, who did not wait for the student to respond to the knocking. In itself, this act on the part of the RF reflects utter disregard for students and has led to students feeling enraged and violated.

To give an example of a more high-profile violation in the college, there was also a fiasco regarding the College Student Committee for the batch of 2016/2017. A new committee of students was hand-picked by the management without the CSC's knowledge, and the CSC was later abruptly dismissed without proper notice. There are also more stories regarding the unprofessional behaviour of RV's management.

To clarify matters, I myself have not gotten any demerit points from the college. I am not here because I am unable to accept the weight of my 'mistakes'. I believe that RVRC students are posting these complaints on NUSWhispers instead of sending in emails or posting on RV's facebook page because we want to make these issues known to NUS, and thus provide an external pressure to the college to change their management style. Because if we sent in a private email, would they really bother doing anything?

5737,52982,"To the writer of #52967, you are misrepresenting the rvrc students and the seriousness of the problem by alleging that these complaints on NUSWhispers were the work of a salty immature kid. I assume you are a rvrc resident too, and you will know the issue of overpolicing here is real, stiffling, and has caused many problems to many students and even seniors. It is a fact that there are rvrc staff who barge into student's room for spotchecks, it is also a fact that rvrc staff have tried to review the ohs rules and impose more stringent conditions, such as leaving the door further than just ajar - it must be one elbow length when opposite genders are inside. At the heart of the issue, it is evident that the focus of rvrc is on regimentation, even if it is at the expense of the quality of residential life of the students. These are not issues that can be resolved or glossed over because of rvrc's good location or because you can be a phantom here. You also know better why people choose to complain on NUSWhispers instead of talking directly to the management, because so many batches of seniors have tried and failed. Its not like NUSWhispers is a better way to resolve the problem, but it is a good platform to rant and share our experiences. While you are indeed right that rvrc has her own fair share of problems, rvrc's problems are way larger and more serious than the other colleges"

I love competing with my fellow residents for demerit points through means that I didn't know existed! The more points the better right? First to 16 points wins. I love it when I am heroically rescued from fires by the removal of an extra shoe outside my door as it makes me feel like a Disney princess. I love the 5 Michelin star food served everyday that tastes like a wet dream from a K-drama. I love displaying my boy-on-girl action when I leave my door wide open for everyone to see me being a naughty girl. I love the dictatorship and it makes me feel like I'm on tour in North Korea for free! I love reliving my primary school days through the extreme disciplinary regime, and I am even thinking of going for RVRC flag raising every morning at 7am with pride in our RVRC purple!!! I love having no fun culture in RVRC because I can focus on being a loser instead. I love the way the College Master is not the highest authority as it gives me hope as the underdog. I love the suspense from not knowing if I will be expelled today, tomorrow or next week. Every time I open my email I hope that they give me more points to set a new high score. All in all, I love RVRC and would recommend staying here to anyone who hates themselves so much that they enrolled into university to torture themselves and wants to die 50 years early "
5739,52977,"I am from RVRC (Ridge View Residential College) and I would like to share my views on the recent musings on whispers. I am just an ordinary person, with one pair of shoes outside of my door, and I try not to inconvenience my friends living around me.

RVRC is a place where I met made new friends and meet passionate people from all walks of life. I do not know how it will be like if I were in another college, but I do not have much regrets staying in RVRC. It's pretty comfortable and cosy here, with slightly larger rooms in the blocks A to E and the convenience of being at the centre of the school. 

So far I have never encountered any RF barging into my room, and i think it is because they have no reason to do so. I don't think it is fair of previous commentors to make such incidents sound like it is super common? Maybe these news are being oversensationalised just for the laughs amongst other things."

I assume you are a rvrc resident too, and you will know the issue of overpolicing here is real, stiffling, and has caused many problems to many students and even seniors. It is a fact that there are rvrc staff who barge into student's room for spotchecks, it is also a fact that rvrc staff have tried to review the ohs rules and impose more stringent conditions, such as leaving the door further than just ajar - it must be one elbow length when opposite genders are inside. At the heart of the issue, it is evident that the focus of rvrc is on regimentation, even if it is at the expense of the quality of residential life of the students. These are not issues that can be resolved or glossed over because of rvrc's good location or because you can be a phantom here. You also know better why people choose to complain on NUSWhispers instead of talking directly to the management, because so many batches of seniors have tried and failed.

They completely removed a fully functional and up-and-coming student leader committee as the power hungry management leader wanted things her way.

Yeah mine was a similar predicament, so I applied to those in more affordable countries (not approved by SMC), but was rejected a couple of times. 

Put yourself out there to experience new things, talk to people about what you want to do, then you would realise what is practicable and whether you had over-idealised your dream. That's why doing shadowing and volunteering may help. If you can envision yourself working in that setting in the future, you would be more motivated to continue pursuing the dream.

For me, at this point, closing in on graduation, I start to see the possible job prospects should I graduate from my current course. I start to waver a little considering how I may still find something suitable for me in this industry if I ultimately don't do medicine. I have come to terms with the fact that while Medicine is my first choice, there are many other ways I can contribute to a good cause with my skillsets. My 'backup plan' is to work with NGOs after getting some years of work experience, so I am currently quite at peace with myself should I not obtain admittance to med school. Anyway, no med school means I get a life. If you think that life is hard now, it may be worse in med school, so there is nothing to 'complain' about at this stage.

While the future seems bleak, while 4 years may seem like a long wait, be at peace with yourself and live your life to the fullest. I understand your worry and anxiety as I was where you were. If you were meant to be a medical doctor, it would happen somehow, and since a part of it would be dependent on what you do now, don't leave regrets:)"

5756,52953," I'm another student from RVRC. I don't like writing rants like this online but I feel like I have to as the college have really alienated its students with it's recent antics (which explains the recent surge of RVRC students complaining here)

Here are some examples of some of the ridiculous things which RVRC's management have reprimanded and/or charged students demerit points for:
1) Leaving decorations on our room doors (which is perfectly acceptable in  other RCs/Halls)
2) Leaving more than 1 pair of shoes outside our rooms. They justify this rule by saying that every additional pair constitutes as a fire hazard, but then again there's a Residential Fellow with 5 pairs of shoes outside her door so... What's worse is that I know somebody who was woken up at 6am just to be told to keep his shoes in his room
3) Having mutually agreeable room swaps. Both parties were agreeable to swap rooms and had the backing of the Office of Housing Services. But RV management blocked it and gave demerit points to both of them for swapping rooms beforehand
4) For leaving a towel in the toilet. Someone had their towel thrown away and was threatened with demerit points just for that (is this really necessary? Surely a simple ""please remove your towel"" will do?)
5) For not locking our doors 
6) For leaving our stuff in lounges while we're not there
7) For an untidy room (Tidiness honestly is so subjective, what could be untidy to one could be tidy to another)

While I do agree that rules are rules and they are meant to be followed, I feel that there is some leeway that can be exercised here. I don't agree that any of the above instances even warrant a reprimand or demerit points. If there isn't any major inconvenience or repercussions to our fellow residents from those instances then I don't think it warrants disciplinary action. I believe as young adults we know if our actions are really too much. 

RV is a very young RC and honestly, a lot of us have really tried to improve the culture here and to make ourselves distinct from the UTown RCs. However, this over the top disciplinarian approach and constant interference by the management is killing the freedom of its residents and  any attempt at forming a distinct college culture. 

Also, if you are planning on going on exchange in Y2S2 (especially for biz students), join other RCs. Unlike the UTown RCs, RV doesn't reserve a place upon your return in Y3S1, despite contractually being given a 2 year stay as part of the college program. The people in RVRC who are affected by this have said they feel alienated by the college, especially as all of them has contributed to the college as part of its FOC committee

TL:DR: For incoming freshmen, if you desire to enjoy a hall/residential college culture, don't join RV. You will just feel restricted with no freedom to enjoy yourselves.

Turns out they were wrong. There is a culture. The NS style, anal, watchful, no freedom, treated like kids kind of culture. I mean seriously. 

No more than 1 shoe outside corridor?? I mean I get there has to be a limit to prevent the common corridor from being blocked but 1 is wayyy too little!! 

No member of opposite sex in the room without leaving thedoor open?? Help la all are young adults here. This isn't the 1960s where having a girl/guy in your room automatically means having sex. Platonic friendships do exists. And besides so what if they decide to have sex? Again, uni students, legal consenting adults. NUS offers married rooms for married suites for MBA students so I don't see this as an issue of NUS not allowing sex in school. As long as it's behind closed doors, doesn't disturb neighbours and MOST IMPORTANTLY IS LEGAL (aka consensual and parties are not minors) then there should not be an issue.

And also what's with staff members barging in to our rooms?? Hello have some respect for our privacy please. You wouldn't want people barging in to YOUR rooms would you? It's not a matter of having nothing to hide, it's a matter of respecting others privacy.
Guess I should have saw it coming when the FOC was already so micro managed by the staff members instead of being what uni level camps should be. A camp FOR students BY students.

Unless I see a change in the rest of the year, I really see no reason to tell my juniors to join RVRC."
5762,52942,Is Uni all about the grades? I can feel that my friends judge my intelligence based on my tutorials and assignments. I might be a lot dumber than them but I at least try to my best in studies. 
5763,52940,"Admin please don't remove this post. I have already done my due diligence in censoring and watering down the tone of this post so that it could be published. So here goes: 

Another student from RVRC here. In all honesty, if you intend to stay on campus, do yourself a favour by applying for other halls or RCs instead. Aside from what was already mentioned in the previous posts about demerit points, I would like to also point out that RV has a notorious RF who would barge into students' rooms without seeking permission. 

Yes we understand that RFs do have the authority to enter rooms without permissions, but only under strong justifications. This particular RF would enter the residents' rooms for the most trivial matters (such as for leaving more than a pair of shoes outside), and this RF may even do so in the room owner's absence, which I personally found to be an utter disrespect of personal privacy. 

I did not spend nearly $3000 per sem for a single room only to have my privacy invaded so easily. RV may argue that they are doing so to uphold house discipline, but I feel that this still doesn't warrant the RFs the right to abuse their authority so easily. While it is true that I have signed and agreed to certain terms and conditions before moving into RV, I would still be uncomfortable knowing that there's a RF lurking around, ready to jump on unsuspecting residents in the comforts of their own rooms. It would be nice if RV could actually respect the residents' privacy, and at least knock and inform them about spot checks instead of just entering a room uninvited. 

For a young and budding RC, RV still has a long way to go before they could finally establish a sound reputation that can easily draw in students the way UTRCs do. Seeing how RV has been so readily dispensing demerit points to its residents, and how the RFs are increasingly intrusive and uptight, RV may one day find itself in a chokehold caused by no one other than themselves.

P.S For my fellow residents here in RV, it would be strongly advised for us to keep our rooms locked and bolted at all times, otherwise the RFs would just take it as a sign of invitation.

I was in a similar position. It was not Medicine, but Teaching. My parents were teachers so for most of my life I aspired to be a teacher. But when I failed to get higher tier scholarships unlike most of my friends, I was devastated. It did not matter how absolutely well I was doing in life, I measured myself relatively and was resentful at life and at my peers who could get what I thought was a better deal. 

Our problem is actually our own idea of ourselves. We are fixated on an idea we constructed of what we must be.  If we gave ourselves a chance to grow instead of wallowing in resentment, we could actualize in ways that we can't even envision now. It need not be Medicine for you. Even if it was or wasn't, your sense of worth and validation need not be linked to this.

I just graduated this year. I struggled with this sense of resentment but gradually understood more about life in general. You seem way younger in uni, so do utilise your chances there to discover and do something worthy!"

5797,52883,"Guys, when you come to NUS and plan to stay in RC, do put rvrc ridge view residential college as your first choice!- its highly recommended- especially for people who just come out of NS. They penalize demerit points (3 for each offense) for leaving 2 shoes outside your room (instead of 1), not switching off your lights when you leave your room, for bringing your male/ female friend to your room for 45 secs, for leaving your things in lounge unattended for 2hrs, for not locking your door (yes, that is a really irresponsible offense) and many more. Along with the natural greenery and natural vistors such as bees, wasps and rare species, it is a perfect place for military outfield like training! I am proud to say- rvrc has evolved to become more disciplined and exciting! I hope that add discipline into their motto next time:) Hope to see yall here!

So this is why people queue. Perfectly logical.

On the other hand, if you would want to own a car, minimum monthly  depreciation is $700. (Just the car itself, excluding operating cost) For people with relatively sufficient disposable income but not enough and not willing to spend on a car, buying the newest phone model really make sense.

Even if iPhone goes to 2.5k to 3k, and depreciation goes beyond $100 monthly, the sales will be good. Because the next jump to a car is far too wide.

They are also less likely to have any background information on the companies, and would probably not think as much about their compensation as their employers.

It is understandable that the university wants their students to have some real world experience. An internship is perhaps a demonstrable way to show that. Unfortunately in some cases it is the student who has to pay the price for their ignorance, where simple questions are all it takes to prevent it. If you think the people running the show are going to do that for you, good luck. Hopefully people going on internships will question their prospective employers, because it is not money, as much as it is time, that one stands to lose."

Like it or not, sex is an important part of a relationship. If your partner can't find sexual compatibility with you, it's a perfectly legit reason to break up. Let's not judge people just because of that. 
To the commenter that said: ""If the girl breaks up with the bf because of this, she is not worth it""? Come on man... What's the other alternative? She remains unfulfilled for the rest of her life? Or are you saying other girls with naturally lower sex drive are more ""worth it""?

It's all about compatibility.

5898,52725,"Hey,

I just want to apologise for reaching out to you in an inappropriate way and causing you discomfort because of my action.

In a weak moment very uncharacteristic of mine, I forgot the fact that we both have had our own lives without each other. That I have no idea how the situation is like for you at the moment. That I have no rights to suddenly pop into your life once again and inevitably bring along the memories that I don’t know whether cause you pain, disgust or merely indifference...

And thank you. Thank you for not reaching back to me and preventing us from making a terrible mistake for the second, or third time? For teaching me that life doesn’t always go according to my plan, and how to continue being gracious in those moments. I guess I have more growing up to do. I guess, I might no longer be a girl but I’m not yet a woman either.

And thank you, for giving me back that part of me that seemed to have gone with you. I don’t even think I’m making much sense here but somehow, I feel like myself again. I can feel a sense of control of myself going back to me from my head all the way to my fingertips. And I don’t think it will go away. So once again, I just want to apologise and thank you, and wish you all the best."

5906,52715,"This post is intended to provide a balanced view with  regards to NUSSU Internal Council Election yesterday.

*Disclaimer: I was there as an observer and asked a number of questions to both Presidential Candidates. I am not associated with any clubs, any parties or whatsoever. The views and opinions expressed below shall reflect mine and mine only.

I am a Y4 student who have never once interested in NUSSU's affairs. To be honest, I am just a typical apathetic NUS student who mind my own business throughout my 4 years in NUS. However, something drew my attention during this NUSSU election. It was none other than the manifesto put forward by the concerned students' (CNS) team. I was strongly motivated by their their agenda which captured the ideals and values that I religiously believe in. Hence, I exercised my right to vote for the first time and voted for them. Although I personally  know the 2 candidates  (belonging to the so-called ""Insider Team"") that are representing my constituency since both of them are from my major, I still voted for the CNS
representative. I really had full faith in CNS. 

However, I also came to realise that I have yet to hear much from the other team and understand their side of the story. Besides that, I also wanted to see the candidates physically, especially the Presidential Candidates, and assess how dedicated and committed they are to their campaign promises. I thus decided to attend the meeting yesterday. I honestly did expect a fair bit of commotions and drama,  especially given that it has been such a contentious and controversial election campaign. In fact, I was also interested to know how each candidate would respond to questions on the importance of having an united NUSSU exco regardless of parties (I did raise a qn on this to both candidates) as I am of a view that  now is the time to put aside the differences and work together as one. 

CNS Presidental Candidate was the first to present which followed by a Q and A session.  I found him eloquent, idealisitc, determined and knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I was pretty impressed. I felt that he does deserve to be the President of NUSSU. 

Next was the Presidential Candidate from the so-called ""Insider Team"". He did a pretty simple presentation mainly emphasising on his motivations to run for the post and his past experiences, which then followed by a Q and A session. I found him frank, understanding, sincere and pragmatic. To be honest, he did not impress me as much as CNS Presidential Candidate especially in terms of presentation. However, he did one thing that took my breath away. His frank and humble  admission to the council that he is neither a visionary nor a strong communicator. To me, the fact that he is willing to lower himself and tell everyone that he is an imperfect being like everyone else instead of portraying himself as a perfect leader who is above everyone else is a good indication that he is not an elitist and that he truly believes in the philosophy of servant leadership. Moreover, I was really blown away by his track record in advocating for the welfare of disabled students as he could easily recall their names and explained with concrete examples what he proposed to the NUS management in his capacity as depty welfare sec for them. Only then, I realised how sincere and genuine this guy is unlike how some people have tried to portray him online. It then hit me that I should not have judged him based on a 3rd party's opinions (especially if the defamations made are anonymous).

Although I dont wish to end this post on a negative note, I would like to highlight that I was totally appalled by the conduct of some of the CNS candidates and their allies during the Q and A session for the ""Insider Team"" Presidential Candidate as they were not only harping on his marginal win as a candidate representing his constituency but also getting emotional and raising voices towards the candidate. These kind of disrespectful acts are uncalled for in a civilised setting. Please refrain from such acts during the second session later today. Do remember that getting emtional does not solve any problems and issues. I am extremely disappointed to see such behaviors in people that I have voted in with full faith. 

By the way, please stop playing
politics guys. No one is going to benefit from it in the long run. Do grow up please. 

With best intentions, 
Zay

5907,52714,"""One of the official reasons given for the requirement of outgoing club's MC endorsement is for the outgoing club MC to only endorse students who have contributed to that club. However, curiously, some of the past NUSSU exco candidates for clubs were not active members of the clubs. With such candidates still being endorsed by the outgoing MCs, questions have to be asked on the reasons why the outgoing MCs decide to endorse or not endorse certain candidates.""

Not just in the past, even in the current exco, there is a significant half of the elected exco representatives who have not made any contributions to the club that they represented in the external elections (Engineering Club, CAC, CSC, NUSPA just to name a few). It was more like a strategic way to garner votes university-wide since voting booths were set up in a prominent area in one of the clubs' compounds during the voting period.

We would also find out in due time whether these representatives really represent the voices of each constituent club in the exco, given the lack of experience and past contributions in the club they represented in the external elections. Only time would tell if these students ran the elections for the sole interest of serving the student population."

5912,52708,"I've finally let go of my ex, and it took quite a bit of work. Months of clearing out all memorabilia of him only to find something else tucked in some corner, and then feeling really terrible for a week or so... And there were days where I just missed the entire relationship and remembering all the good things and all the good times we shared and basically how good a boyfriend he was to me.

But I remember all the shit he did too, and I remember how badly it ended and exactly how his selfishness landed me in that pathetic state of misery. How his unwillingness to reassure and deal with my issues but rather choosing to ignore me when I felt down caused me no end of social anxiety and mistrust in relationships. How he was toxic to everyone I knew, choosing to rather tear me away from my friends than to get to know them. But that's over now, it's all in the past, and with time I'll forget.

I choose to let go. I choose to realise that it does not matter anymore; the past is the past. I can't change anything, and missing those times will just make me long for it more, and so as bittersweet as it is, I'm letting go of the memories as well. I won't let them control me any more. I choose to let them fade and age, one day to be less than a bad dream a long time ago.

They're in the past, and they don't matter.

Slowly, I began to see that who I am is not defined by who I'm dating, but who I choose to be, and what I choose to do.

It feels good, liberating.

How do I know? Because today I can look at the photos I accidentally found and not feel any more pain, no more longing, no more sentimentality or nostalgia or whatever.

I've finally let go.

I am absolutely disgusted especially by how self-righteous and arrogant he is. He is the literal embodiment of a keyboard warrior - lecturing others while on an imaginary pedestal of ""maturity"", all while hiding behind the comfort of anonymity. 

Besides, why visit meme pages if you are so sensitive to the content? Nobody goes into a whore house to espouse morality, so please do yourself a favour and get off that high horse. I personally feel that one's perceptions of your own supposed maturity are subjective - you don't affirm that yourself, just like how you don't singlehandedly claim you are the most good-looking, or the most intelligent.

2. I had a new essay done at the cost of not sleeping for a night on that day.

3. I am on a scholarship requiring a certain CAP for my degrees. (For those who said I need to improve my writing, despite my A Levels rankpoint, I come from a poor family background and my parents are hawkers who communicates in Chinese and tries their best to afford my school fees.) I was very depressed when someone implied that I am spoilt and complained for no reason.

4. It has been stressful for me to take ddp but I really need the scholarship to pay the school fees and travel fees. Without it, I will probably drop out of uni.

5974,52605,"The MRT East-West line track fault between Jurong East and Clementi on 19/9/2018 clearly shows top level mismanagement.

There needs to be a parallel MRT line running from Jurong to CBD. At least with the DTL, the East side of Singapore has multiple redundancies in the event of a MRT breakdown. Currently, there is no such redundancy for the critical Jurong area until at least 2030.

See, the thing is that the West part of the East-West line is overloaded. It has been extended greatly to accommodate six additional stations from the original terminal at Boon Lay. That's a 46% increase from the original designed capacity.

That area also took on the additional load from housing estates like Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang, both are incredibly dense towns with relatively poorly designed road infrastructure, compared to Yishun, Ang Mo Kio and Tampines.

I believe the JRL project, specifically the section between Jurong East and the proposed future station at Haw Par Villa, should be pushed forward and be number one priority right now. Or at least, an additional MRT track should be constructed to ease the bottleneck between Jurong East and Buona Vista.

In the meantime, there should be compartmentalization of tracks. A track fault should not impact the entire or half of the MRT line. If a track fault occurs between Jurong East and Clementi, then trains should turn around at Jurong East and turn around at Clementi (i.e. more turn-around points must be built). It would have been better if SMRT stopped train service between those two stations and fixed the issue than to continue at slower speed. Think about it this way, would you cross a suspension bridge if one cable snapped but the bridge is still fine?

Anyway, good job to those people at LTA, SBS and SMRT working hard to resolve these problems. Nowadays, the North-South line and other lines have lesser delays and breakdowns all thanks to you guys. Cheers!

TLDR; Identify bottlenecks and build more redundancies at choke-points."

5979,52600,"Why does everyone claim to be an introvert nowadays? It's really just an insult to the real introverts out there. 

""Oh. I'm an introvert and stepping outta my comfort zone."" You hear this alot nowadays, in interviews, in personal relfections, in beauty pageants, competitions and in conversations to describe oneself.
It sounds so fake. They dont act like it. You check their Instagram and they have 1000+ followers and tons of photos of them showing off in bikini and washboard abs and posting an Insta story every hour.

Even those extroverts will dare call themselves at least a ""half introvert"" or some other made up term. Like, what is that? You see the person hanging out with a large cliche 24/7, drinking and going clubbing and going all rabak, and when asked to describe, they're like ""aah...I may not look like it but I'm actually very shy ah, I'm an introverted person one"".

Gimme a break. And well, I suppose no one will dare call themselves extroverts anyway since it sounds self-appraising. Thus, in this world, apparently every millenial is an introvert.

I'll tell you who the real introverts are though. They're the ones with only one or two or no friends at all. The ones who usually eat alone at the canteen and mind their business. The ones with a blank profile pic and hardly uploads on instagram or facebook or better yet, have none at all. And the ones like me that post a silly rant on NUSWhispers anonymously.

5986,52592,"With the release of the NUSSU exco rep elections results, the bitter campaign season has drawn to a close, at least for those of us plebians not on a management committee. Those who are, however, are likely to see even more drama in Saturday's council meeting. However, here's a quick highlights of interesting points in the vote results.

-Arts Club showed an outsized turnout of 455 valid votes cast, the largest among the faculty clubs. Even accounting for FASS being the largest faculty, the percentage is still higher than almost all other clubs, reflecting a more politically engaged student body.

-Clubs which were not contested at all, such as Business and Science, showed a correspondingly depressed turnout.

-The insider team's presidential candidate came within 14 votes of losing his seat in Computing Club, despite it being an uncontested race, and was the poorest-performing candidate to be elected. Another sign of the massive drama surrounding this election, as he was previously elected president of Computing Club 2 years previous.

-SDE had the challenger team's single losing candidate, losing by a wide margin to the insiders' two candidates.

-Engineering Club had the most exciting race of all, with candidates on both sides being popular among the student body and the challenger team's presidential candidate running there. It came down to an extremely narrow victory for the challenger team, with 6 votes separating their less popular candidate from the insider's more popular candidate. Percentage turnout for the vote, however, was below the average for contested faculty clubs.

-University Scholars Club (the faculty club for USP) had both the highest turnout by far (305 valid votes out of a total population of ~800) and the highest approval rating for the challenger team's (uncontested) candidate, at 98.7%. As USP students can vote both here and in their respective faculties, this offers some insight into how critical USP and Tembusu support was for the challenger team, in particular for RC-Engin students who most likely decided the ~20 vote winning margins in Engin club.

-For the non-faculty clubs, the real shocker was in NUSPA, an uncontested race with one challenger and one insider candidate. The insider candidate failed the vote of confidence by 15 votes, in an election limited to Singapore Citizens, depriving them of a critical exco rep seat.

As it stands, the challenger team has lost by a hair's breadth, with 9 candidates elected to the insiders' 11. The next round of elections for NUSSU positions will be internal, limited to those elected here and representatives from the constituent clubs."

I am the only one who was initiating talks.

I do not like to appear as being too desperate for friends, hence usually when this happens I tend to let it go and stop talking to them when the semester ends. 

I am starting to wonder if the problem lies with me or is it a common thing in Uni? I am fine with being alone or with just hi-bye classmates, however I just feel a slight regret if I cant get to experience this social part of University life that others can.

So what do people usually do to make friends in Uni? Do you still continue to try to talk to people who dont seem interested/dont bother to intiate convos, in a hope that they will change their opinion about you? Or does it all boils down to luck."

6011,52551,"Recently, I was very inspired by the mental health awareness campaign Beyond  The Label launched this month by NCSS. I knew some of the ambassadors of this movement because they came out with their mental health struggles openly, even with the stigma surrounding them. 

I like to share my challenges here, and hopefully encourage people to share theirs. The best way to get rid of prejudice is by listening,  understanding and empathising. I don't know who would care about what I have to say - but I know that it has always made me feel better when I read similar struggles by others and I know I'm not alone. 

I am not clinically diagnosed with any sort of mental disorder, but I am a generally anxious person who gets worried way, way, WAY too easily. Just because there's no official diagnosis from the doctor doesn't mean the symptoms is less severe/paralysing.

I can ruminate on the same things for hours on end each day - just trying to connect all the possible causes, reasons, factors why the things that happened to me happened, and what the bigger problems are that lie ahead of me. 

I contemplate suicide on a weekly basis, I google ""I want to die"" more times than I can remember. I have almost concrete plans on how I want to leave - including plucking up the courage to write goodbye notes to my loved ones. Never completed them though - it felt too painful to write on.

When I tell people I think I'm not gonna live past a certain number of years, I see skepticism in their eyes. I know they don't believe me when I say I want to die. I wish i could choose not to believe in myself too.  

Last month has been my worst struggle with this anxious/depressed mood. A slew of unfortunate things hit me in unexpected and continuous waves. I was swept by the harsh currents of life's maelstrom and I am still slowly piecing myself back together from the utter wreckage that is my current existence. Sometimes the half-built puzzle threatens to crumble entirely. 

My health is irretrievably in shambles, the one I trusted most has left me at my most vulnerable state, I'm struggling to keep up in school, my family is distant and aloof. 

Everyday feels like a struggle to wake yourself up. Sometimes I hope to sleep much longer because reality is so painful to confront.

But I'm still here. 

And that's the most important thing guess? Sometimes I have to remind myself how strong I am because despite all of that which has smacked me, I am still here. I'm still breathing, existing, trying even I'm failing to succeed.

6035,52518,"If anyone is still following the nussu election drama... I have to say it is a really sad tussle between 2 sides for what amounts to not more than honorary titles. So far, both teams have had their fair share of grouses and jabs, and it has been fun watching from the sidelines.

However, the filed notice for EOGM, which has been spearhead by a student with apparent (not necessarily actual) support for the ""Concerned Students"" group is particularly concerning. If this comes to pass, what essentially will happen, based on my interpretation, is that the fate of some candidates for the nussu elections, which has been participated by a wider student electorate, can be nullified by what is most likely a much smaller group of students (as few as 100 students needed to vote!), a group who is willing & able to be present at ONE specified time and place to physically vote on whether the election results of particular candidates could stand. I see 2 issues with this agenda:

a) While accountability is critical and necessary, the call for election candidates to present their clubs' financial statements, with the potential for ruling them out solely because of their involvement strikes as counter-intuitive. Significantly, this will be decided before any proof of irresponsibility in their roles, if any. What this amounts to is that those who contributed as a leading member of these clubs can be ruled out of the election even if their finances are in order, but are barred, simply because OSA rules or bureaucracy (or whatever) has prevented the release of finances. More significantly, this is a form of disincentive for future students keen to serve in nussu, but are afraid of facing similar constraints that other students, who happen to run for election without prior service, do not have to face.

b) While admittedly there are undertones of bias on the end of nussu with regards to TLSR, the set-up for the EOGM leaves much to be desired. Not only is a smaller group of voters required to pass any given agenda (just 100), the restriction of time and place introduces a potential voter selection bias (proposed holding of EOGM is at the UTown Chua Tian Poh Hall, which is at the USP doorstep) Ultimately, these factors have great potential to reduce the representativeness of the vote for the EOGM agenda. For a team that touted loudly the fairness in democratic processes, exploiting perhaps less-than-thoughtful nussu regulations for an EOGM to bar opposing candidates, while following the letter of nussu law, clearly goes against both the democratic spirit of letting the majority make the decision, and against their own previously implied standards of what democratic elections should be about.

If my interpretation of the EOGM agenda is in any way fallacious, students who were signators to the document (there are 70 of you, after all) are welcome to lay out your explanation. And for the benefit of the student population, in less legal-speak if possible."

6038,52514,"Second year of JC, I cheated on my then-boyfriend with a guy from one of my CCAs.

He'd been ignoring me for a good 2 months, avoiding me and not wanting to meet up on pretext of being busy and needing space and whatnot. He'd blue tick me for days and ignore my messages... and this other guy was a close friend whom I kind of got close to very fast. He was I guess the closest friend I'd ever had. We clicked well despite not being that similar, and he was someone I worked with frequently because he was helping out with the department I headed though he covered a larger scope of work... So I kind of took comfort with him and basically took advantage of him I guess.

We had some action in one of our CCA rooms after wrapping up events most days, but my ex found out and we broke up.

Not saying what I did was right, but I'm learning to forgive myself for it, and it's taken a long time. I didn't dare to date anyone since and I pretty much cut off all my male friends after that incident... And then I found out he'd been cheating on me too which was why he'd been so unresponsive. It still leaves me with a lot of trust issues here. It probably helps that my school will pretty much not exist from next year on so I guess that's one less trigger I have to deal with. :/

I know the saying is once a cheater always a cheater, but honestly, I feel terrible about it and I don't think I could ever do it again. It was an indiscretion I don't think I could ever repeat, but the worst part is that I can't even say that I was drunk or ""not in the right frame of mind"" like the stereotypical ""bad-decision"" in those cheesy drama plots. I can't even find comfort in saying I don't remember it because I do and it sticks with me, every moment of it clear as day, just feeling guilty about all of it.

And to my best friend, I'm sorry we had to end like this. It was really liberating knowing you. It's been over 4 years now but I still feel really bad about using you like that. I know you're in NUS now, so this is probably the only way I can reach out to you. I hope you're doing fine and I hope you find your closure. I'm very sorry.

Maybe one day I'll find mine."

About 5 years back, I was at an event that was hosted at NUS Utown for a few days. I remember talking to the leader of one of the smaller delegations or teams, and we hit it off quite well.

At this point he was attached, but was going through some issues in the relationship and I can't really remember how but on the second night he sneaked me into his room and things got a bit frisky.

So about a week later we met up at my place for a date and to have sex, but eventually it didn't work out too well. After a few more dates we decided to call it quits and we were never really officially together, I guess.

So I don't know why seeing him together with his girlfriend in school triggered such a uncomfortable feeling, like as if I'm still emotionally involved in this? I'm not sure what was worse, the fact that he didn't seem to recognise me, or the fact that he's happily in a relationship while I'm just another forgotten memory to him.

Before any of you guys jump on this, I don't think he's from NUS from the clothes he was wearing, and I haven't seen him around school, so I don't really need to ""avoid"" him or anything, just wondering if anyone has ever felt the same thing.

I had a friend like that. 

We were good friends of more than 3 years. I was there for her whenever she needed me. I lent her my ears when she had troubles; I let her cry on my shoulders; I gave her advice when she asked for some, even though she never followed them. Till today, I am still keeping the darkest secrets that she entrusted upon me, and I intend to take them to my grave, even though she hurt me. 

We were good friends. However, there came one semester where I had heavy CCA commitments that I was struggling with, and I could no longer be physically there for her. We met much less frequently; I apologised whenever I couldn't make it to meet-ups (I don't ghost. I made sure to notify at least a few days in advance if I couldn't make it), and sought her understanding that I was having a hard time juggling with my CCA, school, and part-time work. Instead of comforting me, she chose to shun away, avoiding texts and all forms of communication. When I finally ditched my schedule to meet, she had already moved on from our friendship. Our usual dialogue became more like an interview, a monologue. I felt the discomfort that surged between us. 

That night, I was unable to sleep. I recalled the past 3 years of our ""friendship"", and realised that it wasn't true at all. For the past 3 years, I was there for her whenever she needed me, yet during the 3 months (just 3 months!!!) when I was struggling the most, she abandoned me. Since then, she only texts me to ask for favours (not to ask how I'm doing, or what I'm up to, but to take advantage of my lingering feelings). It took me some time to get over our ""friendship"", but ever since I did, my soul feels so much more cleansed and calm having disposed of such a toxic friend. 

If you are reading this and have faced a similar experience, please share! That feeling of having your body and soul cleansed of toxic friends is so much more powerful than any juice cleanse :').

Tell me about it. I knew this one girl in a GEM when I was in y2.

She wasn't ready and wanted to be friends. I was heartbroken and stuff.

Took me over a year to get over her. It was painful at that time. I was flooding my ears with ""Another Song about the Weekend"" and ""Have Faith in me"" at every possible waking moment.

I started comparing myself with her, how she was always positive, patient, kind and outspoken. She works hard for her family biz and her grades. A bit neurotic but all girls are like that. I needed to become a better person.

Started putting in way more effort on my studies, drowned myself in self improvement books, got the motivation to start hitting the gym after years of being a calisthenics worshipping cardio bunny. Grew thick skin, tried as hard as I could for everything.

(Stopped RuneScape for a few months too but nobody quits RuneScape lol)

My grades didn't improve a lot but my whole attitude towards life changed positively.

I talked to him and he told me that he ""woke up"" during his time during NS and really started working super hard, focusing on his business.

Guy B on the other hand, managed to get into NUS engineering. He average in JC either but he managed to barely get into NUS engineering due to the low cut-off point. However, due to his average foundation in JC, and the fact that he entered NUS engineering not because he had a passion for engineering but simply because he wanted to feel proud about being in the best uni, he struggled hard and didn't do very well during his time in NUS.

Guy A is already working in a bank and I heard he is earning 10k/month. Guy B on the other hand, is earning 3k/month

I could still remember Guy B was very smug during uni days and liked to show off about his uni hall life and look down on private uni and NTU students.

It seems that we are decaying into acquaintances and soon to be total strangers. 

I admit that a few months ago, I started to take a liking to you. I told myself it was just a crush that would soon past. Weeks past and I realised that it wasn't. 

I have never felt this mental connection with someone else before. Your personality and character just captivates me. And we just seem to click so well. 

It was at this point where things started to change. Being someone who has never been in a relationship before, the realization that it wasn't just a crush, and the potential of us actually being together, I developed symptoms of withdrawal. 

I became someone that wasn't me. Afraid of doing something that will hurt you, I became a little more distant, but yet I was always around when you needed me.

6142,52356,"I am writing this because I want to express my thoughts about what happened during this year's IFG selection. 

I am from Science fac, and I really do want to participate and represent my fac for this year's IFG. I wouldn't want to mention the sport that I signed up for, but I believe the people involved in this should know who they are?

What actually happened:
I signed up for IFG sport X and as usual, there were trials with loads of keen players expressing their interest. It was my first time attempting to get into the main team of this sport and I have been playing this sport for years, so I think I do stand a chance? 

So I went for trials, everyone was given ample playing time and it ended off okay. And the captain told us that he will release the results for the selection process soon.

A few days later, to my horror, the captain revealed that he was only picking 2 players out of ALL the players that went for trial! I was questioning myself why ONLY 2???? 

Some background: This sport have around 10 players in the main team + a few reserves (maybe 2-4?) = total of maybe 12 players.
Quick Math: how about the remaining 10 players???? where did they come from?

After a few days, I found out from legit sources/members inside the team itself, the mystery of the 10 odd players.

These players were players that were already 'pre-selected' even before trials. Most of them were past year's IFG sport X team that wants to participate in this year's IFG again. 
The reasons why this was done:
1. They are good players
2. Have chemistry with each other
3. They want to win and they are confident in winning.

Coming back, I understand that the team wants to win. I also want Science Fac to win. But why deprive close to 50 people the chance to join the team even if they are equally good? 

We keep telling people to join IFG even though they have no experience bcos it's all about having fun.... but where has the fun gone?

I am disappointed at the management of this whole selection process. I know it's hard for me to change anything right now, but I hope that in future this whole thing doesn't happen again. (I hope this isn't happening in other faculties???)

Anyway I hope that the team wins something. If they dun win anything even after doing this, I am even even more disappointed. :X

Tell me about it. I knew this one girl in a GEM when I was in y2.

She wasn't ready and wanted to be friends. I was heartbroken and stuff.

Took me over a year to get over her. It was painful at that time. I was flooding my ears with ""Another Song about the Weekend"" and ""Have Faith in me"" at every possible waking moment.

I started comparing myself with her, how she was always positive, patient, kind and outspoken. She works hard for her family biz and her grades. A bit neurotic but all girls are like that. I needed to become a better person.

Started putting in way more effort on my studies, drowned myself in self improvement books, got the motivation to start hitting the gym after years of being a calisthenics worshipping cardio bunny. Grew thick skin, tried as hard as I could for everything.

(Stopped RuneScape for a few months too but nobody quits RuneScape lol)

My grades didn't improve a lot but my whole attitude towards life changed positively.

6146,52351,"Recently had a group meetup with some of my JC mates. I made a comparison between two friends and noticed something interesting. Let's call them guy A and guy B. 

Guy A studied in SIM-UOL and graduated with first class honors in banking and finance. He landed SIM-UOL because he was very playful, unfocused and lazy during JC days and didn't do well for A levels. I talked to him and he told me that he ""woke up"" during his time in SIM-UOL and really started working super hard, focusing on his studies as well as internships. 

Guy B on the other hand, managed to get into NTU engineering. He wasn't very good in JC either but he managed to barely get into NTU engineering due to the low cut-off point. However, due to his weak foundation in JC, and the fact that he entered NTU engineering not because he had a passion for engineering but simply because he wanted to feel proud about being in a local uni, he struggled hard and didn't do very well during his time in NTU.


Guy A is already working in a bank and I heard he is earning 4k/month. Guy B on the other hand, is jobless. 

I could still remember Guy B was very smug during uni days and liked to show off about his uni hall life and look down on private uni students. He also liked to throw the ""NTU"" word around to boast about him being in a local uni. In the end, I guess the SIM-UOL student had the last laugh. Don't know why but I feel jin song when I think about how the NTU student feeling right now."

But you tell me now that I am holding you back. That while I am there, I must cut you some slack. To let you go, be wild and free. Building your network and chasing your dreams. I hold back tears and swallow my pride. Because in some sense, I know you are right. When I return, you must still be strong. You must have friends who will guide you along.

But my question now is: What am I? Your girlfriend or a stifling fly? Do I really just pin you down? A burden you have to carry around? 

I am strong too. Why can't you see? I came all this way, with my own abilities. A 4.9 but deemed unworthy - both by you and your entire family. I guess I will never be good enough - inadequate, nothing but fluff. Because of you, I lost my soul. My passion, my beliefs, I put all on hold. 

But despite everything, I want to try. I want to fight your battles by your side. To be seen as your equal, to be worthy of your love, I just want to be good enough. So please do not push me away. Don't cap our dates and limit our days. Let me love you and give me your trust. Don't break me please. That's all I ask."

6162,52329,"Hi Op of #52325
I'm not from either of the courses you're interested in, but just wanted to share my two cents on your comparison of NUS vs NTU. Yes NUS is 'more established' in terms of how old the university is and therefore more immediately recognizable by people overseas (and locally). However, 'more established' doesn't mean it'll confirm be the best choice for you. 

Even if the name of the course is the same, do look more into the content/modules offered by each university and pick the one that has the area(s) of specialization you prefer. At the end of the day, it's not where you're studying but what you're studying that will affect how you feel about your course and uni life in general. (And NTU is rapidly rising in recognition and rank globally so it's not a bad choice at all.)

I feel (and so do quite a few friends across different faculties/schools/departments) that NUS can be lacking as compared to NTU and other unis when it comes to the diversity of modules it offers. In some majors, we barely have enough modules to meet the graduation requirements so we're forced to take modules we don't like just so that we can graduate. Whereas NTU (from what I hear and have researched by myself) has a wider offering of modules and content. 

So at the end of the day, don't just go by which is uni is 'more established' or which one people are telling you you should go to (like I did and I regret it), but do your research and see which uni and which course is best suited for you.

6176,52310,"I got so cynical whenever someone tries to sell that ""every school is a good school"" rhetoric. Coming from someone who had to transfer from a sap school to a neighbourhood school after dropping from express to normal acad, I can assure you that rhetoric is just empty talk. 

As a kid that had gone through a branded primary school and being dsa-ed into a sap school, transferring schools taught me what it meant being in an average neighbourhood school was like and the stigma behind it. It wasn’t until I traded uniforms for did I realised the kind of dirty looks I got from random people that made me self-conscious how people really viewed by simply which school you are/were from.

As kid who lived a sheltered terrace-house upper-middle class life, the toilet fights over petty shit, the weekly cameo of the police car in the school compound, the kind of labels I got as a normal acad kid really forced me to opened up and made me feel like a maggot in the mud about myself at times. 

Even now in uni, I do get a bit uptight when telling people I was from xxx High School vs yyy Secondary School. Maybe its because I'm overly self-conscious, maybe its because my ego hasn't recovered from transferring schools but Iets be honest with ourselves, there will always be a little inkling in the public mind that judges you based on the schools you went to.

People have different ways of letting go,
Be it by finding another person, 
Be it by seeing you as a foe.
Or find within them, a reason. 

Being planted in a foreign environment, 
Tested my determination and resistance. 

I am trying very hard, 
As I've been since the start. 
The tornado of emotions you cast upon me,
The chains of your attention not setting me free. 

I've told myself ""I'd let go"" again and again, 
But each time with an intent to pretend.

It's all in my head, no one will know, 
I whispered to myself, bent my waist and took a bow.
You don't know the struggles within me, 
You don't know the extent of agony, you
Put me through. 

But it's not your fault for existing, and being nice, and giving me your time, and smiling sweetly.
Its not your fault for being so keenly, 
Into her. 
It's my fault for these I see.

I want you to like me, 
I want you not. 
I want you to be beside me, 
I want you not. 

I want to make you smile, 
I want to erase your frowns. 
I want to walk with you for miles
And miles and miles. 

Though manly, you pms daily, 
Scrunchy faces and subzero sentences, 
A bad reaction I fear
With each interaction that's near. 

Nagustuhan kita, 
Je t'aimais bien.
naega dangsin-eul joh-a, 
Tôi đã thích bạn.

I used to recall times where it's only you and me,
Faces that I've made you shown to me. 
Seconds and only minutes it may be, 
Etched deep within my memory.

Your proximity made this pathetic heart throbbed, 
it could be the norm for you. 
But, for me it's very new.

I've never admitted to myself I had a crush, 
I thought I was strong enough to simply brush, 
It off. 

I don't expect you to ever like me,
Not even in my imagination would I dare to. 
I don't do these for your attention, rather, 
To let go. 

Finally I think it's time, 
For the feelings to sublime.
I've learnt to not subject myself to homosapiens' judgment,
A painful lesson well learnt.

So don't hate me for the disgusting reactions, 
Lime like emotions and differences.
I'm simply learning to let it go, 
In a lesson you're teaching me. 

And when I do learn, 
To accept you and her, 
It'll all be back to normal.

Could be as fast as the otters we saw, 
Could be as slow as the snails we thaw.

I broke up a year ago with my girlfriend, who wasn't happy with being together. Fast forward to now, and she's happy with someone else. Meanwhile, I'm still mired in the past. Thinking about what I could have done wrong, and what could have been.

I know I should move on. I haven't managed to do it, though.

The self esteem problems that came about from that relationship have ended up with me messing up my chances with promising relationship prospects. Each failure only sets my mindset back further. Perhaps I should just give up and free myself from this endless cycle? I feel trapped.

6214,52248,"Why do guys (or girls) find fwbs, or random one night stands, or even prostitutes to lose their virginity to someone who don't mean anything to them? I mean sex is great and it's their own life, their own virginity and sexual organs they can do whatever they want with them but I just don't think the thought of casually sleeping around is nice at all. If it's like a steady partner it's fine cos at least you know it's someone who mean something to you. At least next time when you tell that to your future s/o, it will hurt less. I mean nobody would want an S/O who had multiple casual partners before right? And it's not right to lie to them too. Unless that's the kind of relationship you're looking for.

I have not worn SAF admin shirt ever since I ORD but I do wear SAF singlets at home which are quite comfortable. I'm not a huge fan of NS, I wasn't a high-flyer, but I still must say I like SAF singlets. 

So I replied to his story ""What's your prob?"" 

Then he just got triggered, overreacted, and verbally attacked me this and that and making other vile personal attacks on me, saying that I must be too poor to wear SAF shirt. 

Of course I was angry and I attacked him back and blocked him.  

Then he screenshot the fighting conversations and posted on his Instagram and his Whatsapp group/s. 

Then one of his female friend whom was a stranger to me also started making personal attacks on me and messaged me. She doesn't even know me!

6259,52184,"With paragraphs. Been good friends with this girl for a few years. We came from the same family background: not very well off, and we have similar family problems. We care deeply for our families. She once went through a bitter breakup/broken engagement and i always try to be there for her, listening or giving moral support. She has been there occasionally for my problems too. The past year she suddenly went cold to me by keeping a distance. At first i thought it was because she felt bothered by my family problems. 

Then again i did not ask for much. I just wanted to speak with someone on the phone and i asked if she could speak to me just one time on the phone. She said no she is busy she is tired. Then she went online facebook and uploaded a lot of photos of her ""fun"" days. And commented on peoples photos. One of my family member was in hospital and on the verge of dying. I didnt know what to do and when i asked to speak to her because i was scared, she gave those excuses. 

Another time we bumped into each other. I was with my friends, some foreigners and locals. She was with her new boyfriend. I greeted her and she didnt seem happy to see me. She claimed she was in a hurry and did not make an effort to introduce her new bf. We got stuck at the traffic light for a while and the whole time she made sure both her new bf and she did not look at me. I was aware of her new bf for some time so it was not a surprise, but we just have not been formally introduced. It is fine w me but what she did later upset me. She looked at my friends and later said in a condesending tone, ""these are your friends? Never knew you had such friends."" I was surprised and just brushed it aside. 

Later she texted me and said she was off to somewhere so no time to talk. The truth is we were stuck at the same traffic light and later on same bus stop. My friends told me it was strange she did not introduce the bf to me. And they said maybe it is because she didnt want him to know me. I am shocked. She knows i absolutely have someone else in mind and would never go for her bf. I have avoided her since then because her actions have made me realise that she was never a true friend. 

Perhaps a friend that needed my moral support but when i needed hers she cannot even bother to call or talk. A friend who was ""jealous"" or afraid that her new bf will be friends w me even though she introduced her new bf to other friends. A friend that judges my other friends. A friend that was just making use of me all along. 

I have held back my words so far on how sometimes i feel that she can be quite fake at times. When we go out and take photos, i take for remembrance. But She tags me on fb and says things like "" oh yet another crazy day i have to listen or entertain my friend while i cant say anything"". It feels very insulting because i thought we met up because we wanted to catch up. I wasnt the only one talking abt my probs. She talks abt her probs and insecurities too. I dont know. Do most of you behave this way w friends? 

She will also tag me that i treated dinner and drinks for her birthday and all that. But she never once treated or asked me out for my birthday. Not even for coffee/teh. 

She makes a lot of effort for her other friends who are pretty successful in life (good jobs and happy relationships) like making hand made cards or gifts for them, plans food outings with them and treats them to expensive meals and all. For me? None. Pls dont be mistaken i am greedy. Yes i am jobless on some months. Yes my family has a lot of probs. Yes i am single and probably unwanted. But i am sure i treated her as well as a true friend can be. 

In her fb she keeps saying all ""positive and motivational"" messages publicly and how to be kind and live life ""great"" and how good one has to be. But when it comes to your one friendship, you surely are a big hypocrite. 

To add on, there was a period when i was unemployed and searching for jobs. Her department had 2 full time open vacancies for entry degree holders and she never once told me about it. I know because another friend works in the same civil service place as her and told me about it. We werent close but i appreciated her gesture. 

When i finally got a job elsewhere by myself and she knew about it, she contacted me and i dont know if she was pretending or what. She offered me a ""2 or 3 months contract job that required only o levels"" in that same department of hers. I declined and told her i was working for a year already and told her that she knew. She said "" in case you need a job again and also this job is better than nothing"" implying that i would be jobless again soon or that i was expected to quit my current job for her offer. 

Last i saw, she has been promoted to a senior manager in that dept. Never knew she didnt want me on her team because she thought i would be an obstacle to her promotion. 

Another time i asked if her friend could help give my resume to his company, a bank. Both of them readily accepted my resume but just kept quiet after that. I followed up but he said he already gave to hr. Last i heard he went for my job in my previous company. She knew about it but pretended not to know and continued hanging out with him. Maybe because he has a house and is more successful than me? 

I know you probably think i am so stupid to continue the friendship that time. But i have learnt my lesson well. "

6280,52157,"If you have close friends of the opposite gender and he or she makes it clear that they want to take the relationship to a romantic level, 

How do you reject him/her without harming your precious friendship that you have forged over the years? 

Answer : your bff status is officially doomed the moment you say no. Find a new close friend.

I had a very close friend. We could talk about so many things, and we could relate to each other for most of them. My friends told me how it was so obvious I liked him because a rare smile (yes, that unique one you'll give when you fall for someone) would only appear when I mention him or I see his texts. One fine day, I plucked up my courage and confessed and he tells me ""oh I only like you as a awesome pal"". I force a smile and say ""it's ok, we are still good friends then"" and still try to carry on with our regular friendly conversations. 

Needless to say, over time his enthusaism dwindled and his replies become noticeably slower and shorter, and our special friendship fizzled out miserably (at least for me, I would never know how he felt) 

x2

I go and talk to my friends for support, and they all comfort me 

with similar tales for both genders. 

So if your friendship is already going to be dead, the excuse of ""I don't want to ruin our special friendship because what if we break up?"" is totally bullshit.

IT IS ALREADY RUINED. 

It is actually best for both of you to attempt a relationship together because even if it fails due to a lack of romantic feelings, you two at least tried, and both of you are convinced that it wouldn't work 

And I'm sure I don't need to elaborate on the awesome perks of being in a relationship with someone who knows you really well loves your company and accepts you for who you truly are

Please, give him /her a chance. 

Because if you don't, a person who is always there for you will soon disappear.

They now have to absorb the 20-cent discount (per order) that customers enjoy when paying via PayLah which I feel is a little unfair to them. Meanwhile, the other vendors who increased their prices later are not affected. The aunty - who is so awfully nice btw - will not mind if you use PayLah, but just thought I'd announce this here to get more people to help them.

6287,52148,"I'm having this severe social media addiction issue of stalking someone online. Almost every hour, I would check on my feed to see if there's any updates about the person. If nothing, I'll search for the person's username / name to check if there's any new post. If there is, I would look through all the new posts, to see who liked / commented on the post, and check out those people to see their relationship. If there isn't any new posts, I'll check on the person's friends' accounts to see if I catch any glimpse of the person. Every night, I would see if the person has followed / added new people, or any new followers / friends. And go through the list to find out who. I've done it so many times that I can possibly remember every single one on the list.

It's getting very unhealthy because I often get very affected by all the new posts and interactions on the posts. I know it and I've been trying to stop. I've tried hiding the person's posts and stories so they don't appear on my feed, but it's really useless as I ended up searching for them manually. I can't block the person because I don't want to lose all contact permanently. Yet, I really need a solution to end this stalking. I'm just wondering if anyone knows any apps / methods to really hide a person's profile, and won't appear even if I search for it? Or any methods to really stop missing & stalking someone?"

Met this girl, let's call her C, in J2 after Prelims. She seemed nice, quite reserved can be pretty animated once you get her fired up. We met during a supplementary lesson for KI since we both got rekt by the paper, and we kinda hit it off well right from the start.

Well one fine day we decided to go out for a date over the weekend. And at the end of that date, I walked her back home and I'll just say that her house's front yard is as big as a small neighborhood park. Okay that may be a slight exaggeration but it was huge.

Alright so SES divide notwithstanding, we went Dutch on most things except gifts, obviously, and we were kinda cool for the first few months.

She'd always said that she hadn't dated anyone before, and that she hadn't had any male friends growing up so she said it was refreshing to have me.

Well I found out that she'd had 3 boyfriends previously so obviously that was a big fat lie. And did I mention her temper? She'd flip out at a drop of a hat.

Her 18th birthday came up and her dad got her a necklace. One with diamonds on it. One that costs more than most people's wedding rings. And she complained that it wasn't flashy enough. And so she got a second one, now flashier.

Her monthly shopping bill comes up to about twice the minimum wage. She's never learned how to do housework, never learned how to fend for herself and her cooking skills stop short of cooking water. She can't.

And then I found out from one of her old friends and a good friend of mine that she'd been in a relationship with this one guy for... Go on take a guess. 

It's not just a couple of years. It was closer to 10 years. Mind you we were in jc and that was more than half our lives at that point.

I also found out that she'd cheated on him through multiple well meaning friends who, concerned for me, were worried I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
Well, I didn't.

They'd broken up because of this whole thing. And I thought, hey, if she could cheat on this dude she's been with for freaking 10 years, what about me who's not even been here for 10 months? I'd wanted to hear her end of it, because barring some massive vindication factor, this was a deal breaker for me.

When I asked her about this, not in a hostile confrontation with her or anything, just wanting to clear it up, she flipped out and asked me why I'd been snooping around. Like er, well, shouldn't the question be why'd you hide it? And like, shouldn't the entire issue be that you saw fit to hide something this large from me?

But no, she went on a tirade about why she was entitled to hide whatever she wanted to hide and do whatever she wanted to do. In the argument, she threw her necklace out the window. You know, the one that costs 5 months salary? Yeah that one.

Sheesh, what a spoilt brat.

I am so tired of this shit. It happens time and time again and I am so damn sick of it. 

Why must sex always be a factor in a relationship? Why can't anyone respect the fact that there are women who desire to remain abstinent? I don't dress provocatively and I have never even been to the club before. I study hard, don't really go out, and seldom post stuff on my social media. I am basically a boring no-life nerd. I don't know why I am attracting such guys. 

My previous 2 relationships ended mainly because of my unwillingness to engage in sexual activities with them. And now, my current boyfriend whom I love very much is doing the same thing to me. The difference is that this time round, the relationship has gone too far to break. We have been together for 3 years and I love him very much. 

But honestly, I am so sick of it. Every day, I look at myself disgusted. Because I was not strong enough to resist. And because of how weak and pathetic I am, I have tainted myself. I gave it to him because I loved him too much. Sex has become my living nightmare which I have no escape from. I despise what I have become but I can't bring myself to hate him. I love him too much.

6335,52068,"I found my current boyfriend when doing a module 3 semesters ago. He's always been a high flyer in class, making onto the Dean's list and generally being very high-achieving. Despite this, he's a caring person who somehow manages to spend time with his parents and friends even though our schedules are quite tight. 

We've been together for quite some time now, but I still can't shake the feeling of fear that one day he'll find someone better than me and he'll leave me for her? It's an irrational fear, I know, but if I wouldn't be asking for help if labeling it irrational was all it took for it to go away. Let me clear it up that he's not given me any reason to doubt his sincerity, and that he's done all he can to give me a feeling of security in the relationship, but these doubts just keep surfacing...

I see friends finishing up their readings and I can barely pay attention to readings for more than 5 minutes when a year ago I was able to mug for 3 hours straight. I tried turning off my phone/wifi etc and remove all distractions but then I end up distracting myself looking out the window or sleeping just to procrastinate my work.

Even if it's absolutely pointless, because it is public funding, universities are absolutely required to get the best people they could.

Basic research grants are like: ""yeah studying this ancient bacteria genome can give us an understanding to treat cancer maybe?"" Is it a racket? maybe, maybe not. If you think that it is, why are you in NUS studying for a degree? My tuition loan debt is 40k, if I just put that in an indexed fund at 5% a year, I would've had 56k right now.

6369,52027,"I am from a poor family. My parents are both cleaners, and combined have an income of less than $4500 per month. This was much worse when I was younger. I can’t recall the exact amount, but I think my Mother earned a meagre salary of some $800 per month when I was in primary school.

Background story: My parents worked the whole week when I was in primary school so they asked my aunt to take care of my meals and stuff. Everyday after school, I’d go to her house where my cousin and I would do our homework together etc. My cousin is 8 years older than me, lesbian, and (I highly suspect) is a paedophile. She used to tell me how this kid was pretty and that kid was hot. And by kid, I mean real, primary school kids.

I was at the age of puberty (about 10 years old) and it was then that I starting developing breasts. She was 18. I recall she’d always make me shower with her and touch me inappropriately at my thighs and near to my privates. She molested me. I can saw this without choking up now, but she molested me. She saw that I was vulnerable to exploitation and she took her chance. She touched me as though my body was hers. This went on for months until I finally couldn’t take it anymore. And before you guys question me as to why I chose to keep quiet, my mom was very close to her sister, and this aunt was the only person that didn’t cut my mom out because she was poor. I kept quiet out of consideration. 

This whole molest thing eventually blew up and everyone at the maternal side of the family heard of it. The funny things is, when I finally told my mom, I thought she’d fight for me. But no, she didn’t. She was asked to clarify this infront of the family and she blatantly lied - she denied everything that ever happened to me. She even went as far as to say I lied for attention. It was later then that I found out that she took money from my aunt. We were in debt then, and so she didn’t even hesitate before selling me and my innocence to my aunt.

Because of this, I become very sensitive to touch. You know how some close friends would hook hands and stuff in jc? I couldn’t even do that. Natural things like hooking hands with your close friend made me break out in cold sweat. What my cousin did to me, and what my mom chose to hide, really screwed me up from inside out. I never got an apology from my cousin or anyone else who took her side, but instead got named as a liar and shunned by everybody. Even till now, I am an outcast at the maternal side of my family when I was the one who was wronged and done a great injustice.

Fast forward 9 years, I had (almost) forgotten about the incident. Everything’s a clean slate in uni and I finally started to forgive my mom. I never went as far as to openly rebel against her but for as long as I could remember, I always held a certain disdain towards my mom. To some extent, I think I resented her. I thought I could leave this all behind until I ran into my cousin last week. All my repressed emotions and memories just came rushing back to me.

She was still like before, unapologetic and smug. All this is old news, and I wasn’t really affected by it. I think at some point, I stopped waiting for an apology. What really upset me this time is that she has become a teacher now. I cannot help but to think that she’s in an environment now where there are countless children waiting to fall victim to her ruse. The school system provides her with the opportunity to prey on as many kids as she wants. She is a predator. I say this because she was 18 when she did what she did to me. At 18, I’m sure she knew right from wrong. I’m sure she knew, no matter what, she shouldn’t have preyed on the 10-year-old me. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never reported this to the police, but I’m concerned that she might try to violate her students. Actually, I’m not concerned- rather, I’m sure that one day, she’d violate one of the students. I say this with absolute certainty. I’m so afraid to speak ip because the last time I did, the tables turned on me. What should I do?"

Depression isn't about seeking attention from others. It doesn't come from a place of selfishness. On the contrary, it makes you want to shield everyone out. Nobody loves you. Nobody cares about you. Nobody wants you. The voice repeats itself like a broken recorder.

If there is one thing you should NEVER forgive your SO for, it’s cheating, be it emotional or physical. 
Let me share my story, the same thing actually happened to me with my then bf of 3+ years. He cheated on me once and I forgave him, but I never felt the same from then on - always insecure, always afraid that history would repeat itself. About a year after we patched up, he started getting cold and distant, and I noticed him spending more time on the phone when we’re together. When I questioned him, he held me tight, looked into my eyes and told me he would never cheat on me ever again and he’s working hard to save up for our future. He said he’s sure I was the one for him, we even discussed about marriage and BTO. Just few weeks later, my friend caught him active on Tinder, responding to requests for drinks and one night stands (purposely asked my friend to chat him up to see how far he would go). Long story short, after much drama and tears on my end, he admitted to sleeping around while we’re together. Those times he said he was “busy”, he was apparently “busy” entertaining those girls he barely knew. We later found out that he even contracted an STD from one of those encounters and unknowingly passed it to me, which explains the very painful menstrual cramps I had been having while we’re together. Although the illness was curable, the experience has scarred me emotionally. 
My ex still had the guts to ask me how I felt about all these. I told him it’s excruciatingly painful, as if someone was stabbing me with a knife repeatedly and it hurt so bad I wanted to die, but I couldn’t die...I was seriously appalled at how this guy could look me in the eye and tell me outright lies and empty promises. 
Fast forward half a year later, I still feel jaded when I’m reminded of him, but I guess I’m better off now, as I don’t have to worry about him hurting me ever again. I’m free of anger and emotional pain, and no more lonely nights crying myself to sleep wondering if he still loved me. I’m now trying to focus my energy on building my career, pursuing my hobbies, learning new things and catching up with friends who truly care about me. Basically, my goal now is to become a better version of myself when the right one comes along. 
It’s not gonna be easy, but I hope one day you’ll muster enough courage to leave this person. Believe me, you’ll be surprised of how happy and relieved you’ll feel after that. "

Not saying that I want to reconnect with him again "
6385,52003,"I was good friends with my long lost primary school friend. We lost touch after pri sch and reconnected again after uni, we both went to NUS and we are both females. We talked about everything and shared our joys and sorrows. Our career, our lack of love life and problems of our day to day activities. 

But what bothered me was her making use of me all the time. During outings we often split the bill and she will pay less. She always wants to go to restaurants and orders the more expensive dishes. I just kept quiet about it. She also eats more than her share during these outings. But i kept quiet because why make it awkward? I was unemployed for a period of time and she was working for an MNC. You would have thought she would split the bill equally. Nope. She paid less and ate more. Even to the last dumpling. She would also cancel on our outings at the last min or postpone to her own timing. She would give excuses like her dog has to go vet appointment (already planned) or that her granny had to see a specialist (also already booked beforehand). These are not emergencies that suddenly happened. These were appt dates she already knew before our outing. But I believed her and just let her cancel on me at the last min. 

Once she had to fly to Japan for a work trip. She kept telling me the day and time so i figured it would mean she wanted me to send her off. I was being nice and even reminded her to pack some warm clothes or gloves. She said she did not have gloves and also ""forgot"" to buy toothpaste and toothbrush. So being nice and worried for her that she has no time, I bought them for her and even lent her my favourite pair of gloves. At the airport, late at night, i sent her off and passed her the items. Her parents were there too but even though they each had their own cars (benz), none of them bothered to drive her to get those items. She also has a maid whom she tells everyone is her butler, creating the impression that she is ""rich"". But her maid has also never bothered to help her buy the items she needed for the trip. I took the mrt all the way from the other end of the mrt line to changi airport for her and later had to take a taxi home because it was too late at night, mrt ended. Her parents also never bothered to give me a lift or somewhere near. We all live around the same area.

When she came back from her Japan work trip about 2 weeks later, she would complain to me about how her team mates treated her. They were quite bitchy and rude to her and were fed up with her. I listened and consoled her. Then she tells me she bought a lot of biscuits and tibits from Japan for her other colleagues in Singapore. In fact she bought for the whole department. I asked why she had to buy for the whole department (her dep quite a lot of people like 20 over). She said that this is a culture in japan that we must return their niceness and help rendered as working colleagues. Ok so she does understand what it means to be grateful. But did she buy me anything for what i have helped her? No she did not. Nothing. 

Come on. It is not like i wanted anything expensive. Even if she threw me a slice of biscuit or a sweet from her colleagues' presents i would be happy because that meant she thought of me. But nope. She NEVER thought of me at all as her friend who have been helping her. She also never returned my favourite pair of gloves or even talked about it. Like it NEVER existed. 

There were many selfish instances that happened during those years of friendship and we drifted apart because i knew she was so selfish. She was also very 2 faced because she hates this girl colleague to the core, but continues to hang out like best friends with her. I asked her why do that and she said it was just for show. I found it hard to believe you would date your enemy out for lunch AND dinner AND even on weekend outings, and yet hate her so much. Like what? Another case in point. Her family is in a mess. Her dad and mum are not on good terms. But she is always portraying a happy family and how blissful her parents are in photos and how she admires them and whatever. She also found a boyfriend and in the end ignored our friendship. 

One day out of the blue she started asking about our primary school friends- people whom i have kept in touch with but she had not. I found it strange and then slowly she revealed that she was getting married and she wanted to know if i was still in touch with them. My guess was that she wanted to invite them to her wedding (thick skin much?). Then she asked me if i wanted to come for her wedding dinner. This was after not talking or messaging me for about 2.5 years. And i was always the one having to initiate a conversation just to maintain the friendship. 

So she wanted to make use of me another time to help pay for ang bao? I ignored her and have cut off any conversation with her since then. My point is, when she reads this, i hope she understands why i ignored her. I was sincere in our friendship but she treated me like rubbish.

When I questioned him, he held me tight, looked into my eyes and told me he would never cheat on me ever again and he’s working hard to save up for our future. He said he’s sure I was the one for him, we even discussed about marriage and BTO. Just few weeks later, my friend caught him active on Tinder, responding to requests for drinks and one night stands (purposely asked my friend to chat him up to see how far he would go). Long story short, after much drama and tears on my end, he admitted to sleeping around while we’re together. Those times he said he was “busy”, he was apparently “busy” entertaining those girls he barely knew. We later found out that he even contracted an STD from one of those encounters and unknowingly passed it to me, which explains the very painful menstrual cramps I had been having while we’re together. Although the illness was curable, the experience has scarred me emotionally. 
My ex still had the guts to ask me how I felt about all these. I told him it’s excruciatingly painful, as if someone was stabbing me with a knife repeatedly and it hurt so bad I wanted to die, but I couldn’t die...I was seriously appalled at how this guy could look me in the eye and tell me outright lies and empty promises. 
Fast forward half a year later, I still feel jaded when I’m reminded of him, but I guess I’m better off now, as I don’t have to worry about him hurting me ever again. I’m free of anger and emotional pain, and no more lonely nights crying myself to sleep wondering if he still loved me. I’m now trying to focus my energy on building my career, pursuing my hobbies, learning new things and catching up with friends who truly care about me. Basically, my goal now is to become a better version of myself when the right one comes along. 
It’s not gonna be easy, but I hope one day you’ll muster enough courage to leave this person. Believe me, you’ll be surprised of how happy and relieved you’ll feel after that. "
6387,52001,"It's been a long while. Still, whenever I coincidentally saw his name on others' social media, I can't help but to feel damn annoyed. 

I ended a suffocating relationship prior, and gladly embarked on my exchange with my new found freedom. There, I met this fellow singaporean exchanger. Initially, I thought lucky me to have found a good platonic friend on exchange, but turns out that is the start of my nightmare. He made used of my empathy through his pitiful dumped-by-ex story to get physically closer to me. He did many romantic gestures and gradually crumbled my fort. We held hands, kissed and he even promised to bring me out on a proper date when we return. 

But guess what, he blocked me off all social media avenues right after returning back to Sg (no, I wasn't being clingy by any means). I was used like a puppet to fill his lonely void and to satisfy his needs for a companion overseas. Being in a foreign place and having just broke up, my mind wasn't functioning logically (or at least that's the excuse I'd give myself for being so naive). I felt so angry at myself for falling into such a trap and for investing emotionally into this. What's wose, I heard from my acquaintance afterwards that he is the sort who ""can't keep his hand to himself"".

I know he's kind of popular in his social/dance circle (ohh i am so tempted to name the dance style because it is rather distinct), but honestly, he does not deserve all this happiness and popularity. I hope that people will eventually see through his fake mask and that no other girls will end up getting cheated. If I ever meet him along the corridor, I am so gonna roll my eyes at him. 

It is time to let go of my grudge but before that, i'd like to say

TL, karma's a bitch. You better watch out."

6405,51969,"There has been a few posts regarding loners not making friends and stuff. I would like to add a disclaimer that there are 2 types of loners. 

First, there are those who are alone because they are socially awkward and can’t make friends. Then they come on NUSWhispers to rant about having no friends. Usually these people intensely desire a one-and-only BFF just for themselves. 

Second, there are those who are alone because they are perfectly happy being alone, eating alone, and attending classes alone. This way, they have more control over their own time. 

These loners that you see have a close circle of friends, it’s just low-maintenance friendship but equally high in quality because they’ve come a long way and they provide space for one another. 

Since these loners often go about their lives in school alone, they have the freedom to speak to anyone they like. As such, these loners have a handful of acquaintances as well. And honestly, these loners don’t care if they are ever going to meet their acquaintances again because they are independent to begin with. Nor do these loners seek to have a BFF because it’s annoying to have someone sticking by you everyday. 

If there are no tables available in the canteen and you see a loner eating alone, feel free to share the table with them. They will be happy to share it with you. They don’t bite, neither do you have to shame them on NUSWhispers for table hogging.

I hope you enjoyed this short Nat Geo narration of the loners species in school. "
6406,51967,"To the people who feels like #51950: speaking as someone who was pretty much a loner throughout university; joining the occasional clubs and activities that I feel interested in, graduated some 7 years ago, happily married now, after graduation until my wedding day, I spent perhaps 6 months or so single in total; it's not hopeless if you make no friend in university.

In my experience, making friends in university is like making friends at an airport transit lounge, the probability of meeting them again and keeping contact is pretty low. My experience is potentially a bit biased since I'm an international student a bit of a loner who does not need that many friends (but a close significant other, possibly), and I recently moved somewhere else to pursue my PhD. However, there is a very important thing that will restrict your social and dating lives if you don't have it: money. I don't mean in the way that all girls are gold-diggers; it's the fact that with money, you can afford to be spontaneous, zoom about, doing things, and not having to worry too much. Of course your budget restricts what you can do: making a spontaneous trip to Paris is not exactly what I can do with a research assistant salary or a PhD student stipends; but dinners in casual restaurants, cabs, Uber, coffee, movies, all that jazz is easy-going. It is very important that you can keep an easy-going mindset. Dating a stressed out, resentful individual is no fun.

Get your studies, jobs, and career in order and get some disposable income. It does not have to be huge; it just need to be ""disposable"", and you know you can dip into it for some fun or chill. If you don't have a job or something that generate enough income to have a disposable income, you are seriously screwed anyway  and need to work on that. Earn more, spend less, save more, all that jazz. I'm not super financially-savvy; if I was, I would have never taken my PhD scholarship (it is practically a 50% pay cut, compared to what I was doing professionally). I took it because I enjoy the work that I do. These days the finance stuff are handled by my wife and I trust her. Some might say: don't trust your wife with money, she may blah blah blah with the savings. If I don't trust someone enough for this, I would have never married one. And if something went wrong, I simply made a bad choice. A fundamentally bad choice can never be remedied by procedures, bureaucracy, and paperworks. You just prolong the inevitable pain and put more stress on yourself. If it fails, it wouldn't have worked out anyway; and sometimes, it is better to fail fast than a long, slow, painful decline.

Really, advice on a social life: find something you can enjoy, and do it with others. Don't do it with the intention of meeting someone; do it because you enjoy it. Enjoy it for a while since after marriage, all that stuff melts away. Once married, if you have time for a group hobby, that time can better be directed to making money. Solo or couple hobby take much less time (that's why I started a herb and vegetable garden; Australia suburb rentals have a lot of space), and you sort of need to keep a grip on your sanity. I am told that children is pretty much the only chance to have make new friends once you are out of college (you know, prenatal classes, new dads meetup groups, Parents-Teacher Association, school working bees, all that jazz). Once you start working, and more or less go steady with someone, you got little energy left. Maybe that's just me, an introvert; I'm also told that extrovert recharge by being around people."

In my JC, lets call this guy Aug. We kinda fell out and this was because he posted our screenshot conversation on Instagram which is popular among people these days. (Idk? It’s a trend for people to have side account and post whatever shit they want)  I was freaking mad and upset that why the conversation between us had to Be known to other people. Afterwards we are no longer friends. He was once my closest Friend I had made in this batch and I told him I have cried so much because of this. He said I was making myself look like a victim. 
Idk why I was scarred and afraid of opening up to people anymore. Later on, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. This makes it so hard to focus on alevels when he is my freaking classmate. As far as I want to break free from him, most of my social circle involve him. There were days I cried so badly that I could run out of the lecture and just cry.

6416,51946,"Dear Sayang.

I know we're not together anymore, and I know you wanted space and time for us to get through this. But I apologise; I need to write this and send it away in deep virtual cyberspace, for myself to heal. 

We had the best time together, and I don't regret loving you and being with you. Although the time we had were short, we had a great run. I enjoyed every moment I was with you, and basking in your stories and rants made me adore your strength, kindness, and love. The love you gave me too was pure and blissful, and I could never yearn for more. The way you stared into my eyes, the way you hold me, how you kissed me; they were always addictive. The more I spent my time with you, the more I see how beautiful you are. And the more I feel that we were right for each other.

But I was blind. I was blind to the gravity of your trepidation about us, especially with our differing levels of affection and faith.  I will always regret that Tuesday night; the night when you realise you were certain that you don't have as much faith in us as me. If I could turn back time and change that, I would. I had wished that with a little hope and faith, we could persevere through together.

Nonetheless, I still hold on to faith; the faith in us, the faith that we will work this out together. I will always be here holding on and hoping for you to come back with that hope, faith, and optimism for us again. This might go against all rationality, but when have our relationship been built on that? ;) We're too different from others to be that pragmatic. That's what made me fall for you in the first place anyway. 

And don't you be afraid to hurt me again. Because you might not; and even if you did, we can say at the end that we tried our best, and we tried it twice. And that's worth trying again.

I will always be here for you, Sayang. I will always care and cherish you as a person, regardless of our state of relationship. Because I know you'd do the same for me. You always have a place in and a piece of my heart.

Loving and missing you always,
Your Tilam

6432,51909,"TIFU

It was raining today around 1.30pm. My friend and I were trying to get to a building somewhere around LT 27 but there was no shelter. The both of us had no umbrellas but my friend had a hoodie. So, I just stood there and a random girl offers to share her umbrella with me. I gladly took up on her offer and walked across with her until we reached the building. It was a short walk but I still felt grateful and touched. 

Now here's where i messed up: I asked where she was going and walked her there but forgot to ask for her name and thank her at the end for that kind deed. Also wanted to treat her to a meal but she had to rush off for a lesson, which was quite unfortunate. Not sexual stereotyping or anything but how often do you see a girl offering a random guy to share an umbrella? I personally see more when its the opposite. Totally wasted a perfect opportunity to get to know a wonderful and kind person.

The person that I would both feel happy and sad when I think of.

6449,51874,"To #51849: I feel like I should respond to you since I found out the same thing last year. I had seen my dad's phone and it was a full blown affair. My parents almost divorced, and it was, and still is, a dismal situation at home. I was pissed, sure, but I think what I really felt was fear. I thought about how much it would complicate my relationship with my relatives, siblings, possible future spouse, the stress just kept piling on and on. Sometimes I had to get out of the house for long walks just to catch a breath, to at least jam that crazy train of thought, even to just stop thinking and finally get some sleep. I thought the madness would consume me.

Reality is, that it's going to affect you. If it didn't, wouldn't you be a psychopath? Although it isn't much consolation, I don't really know what I can write to make you feel better. It is what it is, but life must also be what _you_ make of it. Sometimes it felt internally that I was blaming the failures in my life on my parents. But perhaps in this time of desperation, it felt more true that although I did not choose for this to happen to me, the life that was given to me is still mine, and I could choose what I want to do, and how I want to feel. Even if that doesn't makes sense, this nonsensical thought gave me some sense of control, even if to focus on the normal stresses of life.  

In the end my siblings and I confronted my dad, told him we knew, and told him it was wrong. There was more drama but we got through that time, and you will to. I may have looked normal to friends at school but it was a real fight to keep it together, even to this day. It is kind of sad that I see more of these things happening, but perhaps you can find some comfort in the fact that you're not the only one who has been through it. Even if you have no hope, you can be your own hope for a better future. I know you can."

6460,51856,"When Singaporean students go on exchange, the trend is most of them tend to stick among themselves exclusively and are not open to meeting other people. 

My exchange experience allowed me to meet other exchangers from different countries and many of them are top in their field of studies. Most of us still remain good friends and often meet up in various parts of the world. In fact, we have helped each other find high paying jobs with expatriate terms in different parts of the world with some being global HRs and headhunters while some are already in the management level with hiring influence.  

My point is Singaporeans like to talk and focus about networking but when they are given the opportunity to do so on exchange, they don’t seize it because they may think friendships with non-singaporeans are not long-term & difficult to maintain. It might not be the same for everyone but be open to meeting new people because you never know what you can gain from it, be it 5 or 20 years down the road. "

6462,51854,"I used to be a little chubby in primary school but then lost a ton of weight in secondary school. After losing weight, I’ve had people (girls and guys inclusive) coming up to me and telling me that I’m pretty. Throughout secondary school and jc, I was on the more popular end and had my fair share of guys asking me out.

With all this, you’d think I’d be confident of myself, or at least of how I look. The truth is, my self-confidence is at rock bottom and has always been there. My parents are both on the heavier side and I can’t even put to words how afraid I’d yo-yo back to my old weight if I do not watch my diet. 

Ever since I lost weight (some time between Sec 1 - 2), I’ve never eaten a full bowl of rice up till now. If I know I have plans to eat out with my friends the next day, I’d starve the day before. I’m living on campus, and it’s been 3 weeks into the school term, but I’ve yet to eat anything in school. In between breaks, I’d just go to the library and sit down. The only time I eat is when I go back to my room, and the only thing I’ve been eating are plain biscuits. I don’t eat more than 2 packets per day. I’m an athelete and my diet has been taking a toll on me.. I’m burning off more calories than I’m consuming but I just can’t bring myself to eat. When I eat slightly more than what I usually eat, I feel so immensely guilty and fat. I’d literally feel like one lump of fat walking around. This may sound funny - “a lump of walking fat” - but it’s really how I feel. And when I feel that, I hit the gym again and try to burn all those calories off. You guys might not believe this but I’ve come to a point where I feel most at ease when I’m starved.

Maybe you guys might think I’m vain and all but in all honesty I’m just so stressed out over this.. I can’t decide between my health and what I have now. When I was chubbier, I had no friends. Nobody knew I existed. I felt ugly every single time I looked in the mirror then. Now, although my eating habits are shit, people think I’m attractive and I can at least pretend to be confident. Everywhere I go, I am welcomed. People are also generally nicer to me. 

I know I need help and my habits are not healthy... Even so, I doubt I’d ever reach out for help. Just wanted to put this out here because all my friends think that I’m that smart and confident girl who has it all, but in reality, I have zero self-esteem."

Some nights, no matter how hard I tried, my mind wandered around the empty space caused by your leaving. I didn’t know how significant an impact that a simple text, a hug, a question or just the sight of you after a long, arduous day could  create, until I can no longer take it for granted. In those nights, it took all the strength that I could muster to not break down, give up and admit the defeat.

You changed me, and without you, I can imagine myself still being that awkward loner boy in class. (Well, the truth is, you also made me slightly more rebellious and noisy.)

The most amazing friend I've ever had, in fact. The times that we had were short, yet they remain as memories engraved in my heart.
