63599,"Is it strange to contact a friend whom you were close with before in school but have never contacted each other in a long time (say 8 years) but just all of a sudden you have that wish to rekindle the friendship? Had some successes but mostly failures. Why is it so hard to just want to have those lost times back. Disappointed with those who didn’t respond or dismissed it when I brought up the topic of meeting up once again. Being 25 now I realised it’s harder and harder to meet true friends and we are getting lonelier and lonelier. I didn’t even have hidden agendas unlike your fake insurance “friends”, just genuinely want to rekindle a friendship"
63597,"Hi everyone, 

I would just like to share some thoughts that has been on my mind. Being in NUS for a few long semesters has been a really humbling experience. I have come to meet so many wonderful, talented, honest and genuine people who are successful in so many ways. They are well-read, knowledgeable, articulate, confident and self-assured. Not only do they have opinions of their own, they can also substantiate these viewpoints with convincing intellectual arguments. Inevitably, being surrounded by these passionate, proactive and clever people can be intimidating and demoralizing. 

I have also come to realise that I am not particularly advantaged in terms of my family background. In my early years as  child and teenager, my parents never actively encouraged me to read beyond what was needed. They could never engage in vibrant and meaningful conversations with me - because they were so busy with work and they were not well educated. I do not resent them for who they are, I love them very much, and I am eternally grateful for all that they have sacrificed for me. 

While it is kind of sad to realise how many years I have 'wasted' on non-productive activities that could have been devoted into self-development, I am thankful that at least I am aware of the need to improve and work on myself now. I hope that I still have many decades left to grow as a person, and become a better human being. 

I didn't manage to clinch an internship this summer holiday and I'm already a third year student. I have been rather upset by this for the past weeks. But now, I think I have made up my mind to spend the rest of the break more productively, to read, write, learn and volunteer to causes that align with my values. Hopefully, I will become a more mature and well-rounded individual in time to come. 

To those in similar circumstances, I hope you don't give up improving yourself to become someone you can be proud of."
63595,"Genuine help needed. I don't want to waste my partner's time, effort and money on me. In an LDR relationship that started three months before I left for studies (on hindsight, my parents were right). I've been away from him for so long that I don't feel like I love him anymore. To elaborate, he just feels like a friend now.

General advice would be to open up about this when I get back but I feel so distant that I don't even know if I want to continue this relationship anymore. Besides that, I came to a conclusion that I want to stay in the other country (because of a better job market) after graduating.

First step is to talk to him about this, I guess. But what next? Is this worth continuing?"
63593,Hi is anyone heading to Seoul National University for summer school this summer? I don't know anyone from NUS who's going there so it'd be really helpful thank you :)
63591,"I am with my GF for 1 year and I am feeling bored of the relationship. This is already my 4th relationship. Initially, things were fresh and interesting when I got with her. Now everything like our conversations, dates and sex have become so routine that I can write you an SOP of what we will do from monday to sunday week after week. We are not adventurous and we did try some new activities but often lose interest in them and give up soon. Other more exotic activities are either too expensive for us as students or we are just too reluctant to spend the money on. It doesn't help that our hobbies are different as well. For my past relationships, we have broken up for various reasons but I admit that for me, boredom was one of the reasons. What should I do or should I try another relationship?"
63590,"To #63590 like you, I broke up with my Long time Boyfriend 1-2 years back. Reason why we broke up was cos I don’t see us together in the future as a married couple,I wrote him a Long letter when we broke up thanking him for taking care and loving me and teaching me how to love. He was devastated.. he contacted my bff to know More about what had happened with me when I cut off off contact with him  3 months later, and know tt I had a a bf. Till this day i feel guilty though I did things right.长痛不如短痛，hurt him hard and let him go find his happiness."

63588,"How do you make your university life memorable? 

Personally, I want it to be different from others, not the person with lame hall life, not the busy person always hanging out with friends, not the foreveralone person, not the person who always with bf/gf, not the person with CAP 5.0 and always mugging. I'm currently still struggling to break out of these norms.

How about you? How was yours and how you wanted it to be?"
63581,"There’s nothing wrong with Singaporean guys dating foreign girls. In fact, I am currently doing so because I find Singaporean girls too immature and materialistic. When I went for exchange in Norway, I tried for multiple girls (Norwegian, Japanese, Thai etc) before I settled for a Thai girl. Now we’re happily together and have plans to get married."
63580,"I made a number of wrongful decisions 4-5 years ago, when I was childish. I was like a kid and making random decisions. Now I regret those decisions, and have been stuck in thoughts over these previous setbacks. How should I recover?"
63578,"I am a Singaporean girl and i'm fully aware that i don't represent the entire population of females in Singapore but I have a few things to say to the boys behind #63578 and #63510 . 

1. I have standards and expectations and I set them high including who I want and should date. I set them high because my parents worked very hard all their lives to put me to where I am today. Boy, you don't know how much they worked to put me here. From my phonics lessons in nursery to my honours in the supposedly best uni in Singapore, they allowed me to be earning at least $2,500 per month on my own without depending on anyone. They gave me the power to be financially independent so that I wouldn't have to resort to marrying a rich angmoh just because. 

2. But i still wish to marry a rich angmoh because humans are inherently lazy. I mean I wouldn't mind striking the 12 million TOTO, it's the same kind of feeling. 

3. I set my standards high because I am brought up with lots of love. My parents, my extended family, my teachers, my friends, they accepted me for who I am, they taught me that life is colourful and meaningful because of who I am. I didn't learn about love from a potential lover, i didn't have to wait for him to tell me that I am worth loving. Love was there before boys came into my life. I am not some village girl with 9 siblings who finally experience love just because a boy texts her goodnight, buys her dinner and promises her a citizenship here. 

4. I set my standards high because the boys I've met taught me that love doesn't work out just because you lower your expectations or have no expectations at all. I didn't expect boys to pay for my meals, i didn't expect them to look like Chris Hemsworth or Song Joongki, i didn't expect them to be 100% truthful to me, i didn't expect them to date me exclusively, i didn't expect them to plan surprises and make restaurant or movie reservations ahead, i didn't expect them to be punctual for our dates. But love is not 1+1=2. I lowered my expectations but it still didn't work out. 

5. But those boys taught me that i need to have high standards because it shows that I love myself. They taught me that when i had to wait 1 hour on every date because they overslept, when they confessed that they were seeing someone else, when they want me to pay exactly half the bill and asked me for even the 5 cents in the split, it still freaking hurts. Maybe the foreigner girl is able to put up with all these because they have been through something worse than being disrespected. To be honest, if i really really need to have my time wasted, i would rather stay at home and face the wall. 

6. I set my standards high but they are realistic. I don't expect the boy to give me the moon and the stars because I'm not Megan Fox or Song Hye Gyo. But why should i continue dating a guy who wishes that i retard into 12 years old mental age and stay contented with everything that he bestowed upon me. Maybe the foreigner girl doesn't have people telling her everyday that she has the full potential to fight and achieve much more than what she has today. 

7. I wish for a partner who believes in the best for me, even if the best means that i'll be more successful than him. I wish that he is open-minded and not ashamed that the girl is more ambitious and more opinionated than him. I wish that he will admire me for things that i am capable of and see me as an equal who is able to share burdens with him. Is this too much to ask for in a Singaporean boy who grew up with the same privileges as me? And i don't think going into my 30s or 40s will make me want to hurry and change these wishes... 

8. You are who you attract. I didn't have the high expectations in point 7 and I ended up with liars, cheaters and cowards. If you are a Singaporean guy who is insecure and blames Singaporean girls for having high standards and a sense of entitlement, why not raise your own standards and work towards being a better person so that you can attract the girls with high stardards? 

9. I sincerely wish you look like Chris Hemsworth or Song Joongki because there is a chance you will attract Singaporean girls despite being who you are. I will also suck thumb and take this post back and let you complain about Singaporean girls."
63575,"Eversince I went for NOC NY and came back, why do I get the impression that NUS doesnt want me to get a job in US and stay there. Everywhere I go, recruiters want me to join a company that is based here, I tried to solicit referrals for overseas studies from professors and they are not too keen but are willing to refer me for masters studies in NUS. I sincerely feel trapped here."
63574,"Seeing all the BGR problems POSTs, I'm here to brag...

My Wife and I are openly shameless to one another. Even before we were married and were just starting out. We would always joke and discuss about everything and anything including the serious topics like cheating, sex, gender equality, who pay and what not,

e.g. If she paid I would call her my sugar mummy and if I paid she called me sugar daddy and we laugh it off. 

e.g. When she went to shop for her lingerie she would ask me to come along haha, her reason is so I can choose and learn how to remove later haha. It was quite embarrassing at the shop... So I brought her along when I went to shop for my undies and told her it was for the same reason haha and we both laughed it off.

Honestly if you are already in a BGR, all these sensitive topics are the most important CONVERSATIONs YOU NEED TO HAVE and actually they are easy to start and keep going as every one has their own opinions and you need to have these conversation early on so you won't waste each other's time if you two just ain't a good match for one another."
63572,"To #63531: yours is totally normal. You guys follow each other and the stories naturally appears on top and they would watch. Probably not on purpose but it will eventually reach your story if he browses everything. 

Mine is weirder. 

My ex of 2 years and I broke up in early 2013 so it has been 6 years since we even contacted each other. we are also no longer in each other social media. He had a girlfriend (now fiancee) in less than 1 month after our break up (technically he dated that girl when we were rocky). So i decided to delete him off social media so that i can move on (it took me 6 years to move on and get my current boyfriend). 

of course for the 6 years, i wasnt totally still thinking about him. It was only about first 3 years and the next 3 years i stayed single as i wasnt ready to hop onto another relationship being afraid that it would fail.

So, my facebook is extremely private but my instagram is public profile both platforms post very different content (i rarely double post same content on two different platforms). 

But about 2.5 years ago, i realised that he has been watching my insta stories almost everyday, even though we didnt follow each other so my stories wont pop up in his account in de first place. So its obvious that it's on purpose that he searched my account just to see my post and stories. Also, i cant confirm if it's him or his current finance who does that but it's his account. 

So when i just started to move on, i kept posting things related to him so he can see my stories. Then i realized i am childish - like if i want to move on, i should not show him how upset i am without him. So i started to ignore the fact that he watches and post whatever i always post. 

Now that i have a boyfriend, i posted a few insta stories about him (post really little about him because i dont really like to splash our sweet moments on social media and write long chunck of love messages on social media. A bit no point since de sweet message is for him, dont need anyone else to 'envy' that i have a sweet rs). My ex still watches my insta stories almost daily. I will check my viewers from time to time (not becuase i want to see if he watched, it has been just a habit ever since i put my profile public).

Anyone ever has such situation? Like why would your ex still constantly make the effort to check on you even though he doesnt follow you on social media anymore? In order for him to check, he needs to search for my profile in order to watch the stories. I even changed my ig handle once and he managed to find the new one within a few days. 

PS: my public profile has super little followers (less than 150) and im not influencer or influencer wanna be that post nice things for anyone to notice my account. 
PPS: he is really a social media noob who wouldnt know i can see who viewed my stories cause he rarely uses social media."
63571,"Hi everyone. Recently, I’ve been under a lot of emotional stress. I’ve been suffering from anxiety disorders since I was a child and it has affected my life in many ways. The recent emotional distress has worsened my anxiety. I’ve been researching online and I found that I have symptoms similar to acute stress disorder. I’ve been contemplating to seek help because I feel like I’ve been losing control and can’t cope. Does anyone know where I can seek counselling/treatment without burning a hole in my pocket? I’m just a 19 year old without much savings. I would prefer not to burden my parents with the costs, partly because they do not really take my distress seriously. I know that polyclinics offer subsidised treatments but I’ll have to wait months for an appointment and I feel like I’m nearing my limit. And consulting a GP for referral or a private practicer is too costly for me. I’ve been trying to stay strong and trying to cope by meditating and exercising, but I still end up with sleepless nights that emotionally drain me even more. I’m writing this post at 4am with a headache and hoping that things get better."

63558,"In the recent debate about dating foreign girls, the thing is just like anyone from any country, there are going to be pros and cons. Its really just about your personal preferences. Being the level 99 love guru that I am, let me break it down for you kids.

Dating a singaporean girl
pros:

-she probably earns as much as you do, and she has cpf as well. So she can pay 50-50% for your HDB or your future kid's university fees. 

-contrary to popular belief, sg girls are really not that materialistic. They earn as much as you and can pay for their own stuff really. If you are dating a Siam Bu, you will need to give her $1k per month for her grandmother's neighbor's dog's hospital bills or something.

cons:

-after watching too much Disney films when she was a kid, too much Korean dramas in her teens. Worse of all, being spoiled rotten by her parents, she expects to be treated like a princess. Sg girl: why you dont go Jewel tabao A&W at 1am to my house for me when i hungry? you dont love me anymore right?!

-she cant cook or clean to save her life. Guys if you cant afford a maid, then you ARE the maid.

Dating a singaporean boy
pros:

-he probably earns as much as you do, and he has cpf as well. So he can pay 50-50% for your HDB or your future kid's university fees. If you are lucky maybe someday he will be rich, if not well at least you wont be poor.

-Sg mothers taught their sons well. He will not insult or physically hurt you. You will be surprised that some foreign men think its normal to abuse women. 

cons:

-Childish and immature. Similar to sg girls, sg boys are sheltered by their parents until the point they cant even plan a decent overseas trip themselves. All they seem to be good at doing is being addicted to their video games and mobile phones. Only knows how to bring you to Swensens or jack's place every single anniversary until the day you die.

-He will probably cheat on you with some Siam Bu or KTV hostess someday. Pro tip: singaporeans hardly use Wechat or Line, so if he is spending alot of line on these apps, you may wana check his phone"

63550,"Fellow work newbies: How do you deal with off-colour comments/jokes made in the workplace? 

I only have my own methods, so just want to gather some opinions and suggestions. Meanwhile, various examples of what I mean (feel free to tag yourself):
- Male colleague was going to marry someone from another dept (say sales). One of my bosses, in a big dept meeting where the guy wasn't around, said: ""Eh, <guy> and sales will be sleeping together! AHAHAHAHA!"" 
- Met another company's representative who made jokes about dirty Indians and Geylang public toilet. 
- Weird dude over lunch: ""I am gentle with myself"" *wiggles eyebrows*
- I've lost count of the porn jokes, it's an environmental hazard. I tried the swear jar method, but it had interesting results so I stopped on day 1. Now I mostly use the earphones method. 

My fairly-limited range of responses
- Just don't laugh and give a blank face. (Admittedly sometimes because I'm slow/confused/sleepy)
- Leave the conversation if I can, especially for transient informal gatherings. 

I often don't feel in a position to stop or question these people, so they can still say whatever they want. But I can also laugh (or sometimes leave) whenever I want. This gives me that tiny feeling of liberty and keeps me sane. Everyone else: How do you stay sane?"

63541,"Hi! I'm going to matriculate in 2019 as a DDP CS student and I'm thinking of switching my major to Business Admin. Can any kind soul advise me on what to do? - Any help is highly appreciated! 

Background about me: I come from a low-income family. My dad left during my JC and my mom works odd jobs because she does not have a degree and used to be a housewife. We were fairly well-off at one moment though. My dad owned a small business, however it went bankrupt and he could no longer withstand the built-up stress. I've identified early on in my life that material is going to be my aim in university because heck, I have my mom and brother to support and my passion (or I must say, some not so rare talent in woodworking) is not going to take me far in life (at least not in the SG context). You've known by now that life has forced me to be a practical person, so with the rise of CS and all things AI, I signed up for CS hoping that the major would help me financially and provide job security. 

However, I was recently engaging in a few conversations with several CS/BizAd/IS and QF seniors from NUS and was super puzzled about their prospect. Some said CS can earn up to 10k ish as fresh grad and the median is also fking high at 5-7k, some said CS is inflated and we should only expect 4k in most cases..some said PB in foreign banks can earn the most sometimes skyrockets to 15k?? And then there's also conversation about the work environment, saying tech firms are super cool but high turnover and lots of insensitive people while banks/investment firms are more stable but can be suffocating and political. And those numbers are very off from the NUS employment survey which give 3.5-3.8k as a median, so I honestly don’t know what is true anymore.

This decision is important to me because I’m gna squeeze my double degree into into 3-3.5 years which means there is almost no chance of changing my major, not even after 1 semester – not when I’m also doing tuition and supporting my brother’s education at the same time. I honestly do not care so much about having fun. I also know that this is really up to one’s ability, liking, background, passion and whatnot, but now you’ve got a sense of who I am, I hope to gather as much opinion as I can before making the bet.

P/S: I’m not doing CS-Biz double. To make myself a more humane being, I’ve decided to take up another degree in FASS, either philosophy or history."

63538,"What's with all this angst over Sg guys finding foreign girls more attractive? It's pretty much the same as with SPGs who find caucasians a better prospect.

Basically compared to locals of both genders foreign girls and caucasians tend to have more to offer in relationships that men and women are looking for at the same asking price, so it is no surprise they will be more appealing than locals who are buying and selling at the local market.

The main difference is it is a lot easier for a local guy to date a foreign girl than it is for a local girl to find a caucasian as those can also select from asian dating markets beyond them, most of which have more perks than what local girls can offer. Local guys have much more options in this regard."

Since the break up I have not spoken to her, but now shes back asking me for the booking confirmation and flight details. 
I just wanted to have a public opinion on this. Is it rude and unfathomable for me to have cancelled the air bnbs on my account and the flights as well since we have broken up and I am not going. I am not even going to ask her to refund me for my other flights/ferry/bookings etc. Or is this being too mean to her."

Recently, i started to develop feelings for my friend but they do not know that I broke up with my gf, how should I let her know that i like her without her thinking that I broke up with my exgf because of her?(which is not the case)"
63524,"My boyfriend's goal is to be rich; he wants to live in a landed property, go for expensive meals and drinks and retire comfortably overseas. He has gained admission to one of the lucrative courses, computer science while I was offered nursing. He thinks I won't be able to contribute much since the median salary for nursing grads is $3.4k++ and the pay increment isn't significant for nurses and allied health professionals. As for CS grads, the starting pay is already $4.7++ and with experience over the years, they can be paid up to $10k++. I feel really inferior and inadequate. I have a feeling we'll break up really soon..."
63523,"I met this person online a while back and we got along very well. We became close friends and sometimes we would do video calls to chat. We had many deep conversations and felt a connection with each other. One day, while he was on cam, I decided to secretly cut myself while watching him and it was very exciting. He heard the sounds of me putting down my blade and asked if I was cutting myself. I confessed to it. He told me not to cut myself anymore but I continued to do so. I also enjoy showing him my self mutilated wounds and I really want him to watch me cut myself. Sometimes I will fantasize about him using a blade to injure me and at some point of time we agreed to cut each other when we meet. However, we don't know where we should do this. Is there a place that is sanitary enough and little risk of being found?"
63522,"I'm a Y2 student, and one week into my summer internship, I realize that the job/industry is really not for me, and it's impossible that I'll be in this line of work in the future. It's a pretty big company though, so this internship will look nice on my resume. I have 2.5 months left - should I just do the bare minimum(slack) and treat it as a fun thing?

Tbh, I didn't even want an internship in the first place; I took on one only because everyone seemed to be doing it. Now I'm kinda miserable and I wish I were holidaying overseas like most of my friends sigh."
63521,"To #63521, I'm in the same situation as you and can understand how you are feeling. Even though I'm younger than you, I'm already feeling lonely. Anyway don't give up hope and try dating apps or going for dating events. 

As I personally don't like dating apps because i'm not the best looking, I always keep an eye for dating events. I even signed up for an event called Single Mingle Art jam, which I found through a telegram group. Just hope I can find my dream girl there, and if i cant, i will try again at another event. You can try such events too. Just don't give up hope bro.."

I have a few questions. 

How would I go about taking a loan to pay my NUS fees? 
Do I take a loan from NUS or through the bank like Frank OCBC? 

What happens if I accidentally extend my candidature? Would I have to take another loan on top of that?

63518,"One of my family members is diagnosed with Schizophrenia about 4 years ago and since then all of us are heartbroken to see her struggling and being warded because of violent and uncontrollable behaviour. She eventually got better in 2017 and we took her to overseas trip and try our best fulfill any of her requests. Everything is fine until recently a relapse happened. She will mumble, laugh suddenly and keep walking around. In extreme cases, she will shout when she is agitated. We are all depressed and helpless again. There has been sleeplessness night and all of us aren’t suffering. Now she is on medication and still staying with us at home. However, the medicine doesn’t really fully stop the hallucinations. I find it hard to accept the harsh reality and to continue live. Can anyone comfort me? I tried to think positively but I still feel the world is crushing on me. Tell me and my rest of my family members what should we do to tide through the waves and confront this big life obstacle. Your help is greatly appreciated!"

63515,"Hi, I'm the poster of confession #60105, the one who was jealous of my best friend. I thought I should update you guys on what happened. So I told her about my feelings of jealousy (over telegram), and she cut off contact with me. I was sad, but also a little relieved.

But a few days later, she messaged me to meet up in person. I wanted to apologise for what I said, and to get some closure for our friendship of nearly 7 years if it couldn't be fixed, so I agreed to meet. At the meeting, she dropped a bombshell on me: she had been having romantic feelings for me for years.

I was shocked, but it did explain a lot of things: why she chose to hang out with me so often instead of her many other friends, her constant string of 'boyfriends' who never lasted more than 1-2 months. And yes, I was a little creeped out too.

Anyway, she asked me to go out with her. I was doubtful, but seeing as my dating prospects with guys are zero anyway I agreed to it even though I never considered being anything other than straight. We went on a few dates, and they were great. I never had the feeling of being loved by someone else before, but we clicked even better as partners than as friends. We talked for a long time about my feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, especially as it might affect us being in a romantic relationship, and I think I've gotten over it. We're going out for our two-month anniversary tomorrow, but this wouldn't have been possible without you guys on NUSWhispers telling me to tell her. So thanks for the advice!"
63514,Many people around me talk about aiming to 'go into management' no matter what industry they want to join next time. I am introverted and prefer not to be so outspoken and vocal and I am afraid of high stress. I don't see the point of being so ambitious in your job. Why do so many people want to go into management? Can I do well as an average worker through my whole career?
63513,"How ironic that Singaporean guys are being labelled as immature by Singaporean girls yet Singaporean guys are being highly valued by girls from our neighboring countries. I once ask a couple of girls from Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia on online dating platforms whether they will prefer to date Singaporean guys or their local guys and almost 75 percent of them will prefer dating a Singaporean guy."
63511,"What kind of dating culture is prevalent nowadays?

IMO it feels like:
1) guy pays for girls meals
2) girl gets interested and enters relationship
3) guy asks for whether she loves him
4) girl expresses love by having sex
5) guy gets tired and breaks up after finding another girl

Sounds like a great deal man. Paying for meals can get girls in bed, cheaper than going for those exotic services"
63510,"I am a Singaporean girl and i'm fully aware that i don't represent the entire population of females in Singapore but I have a few things to say to the boys behind #63578 and #63510 . 

1. I have standards and expectations and I set them high including who I want and should date. I set them high because my parents worked very hard all their lives to put me to where I am today. Boy, you don't know how much they worked to put me here. From my phonics lessons in nursery to my honours in the supposedly best uni in Singapore, they allowed me to be earning at least $2,500 per month on my own without depending on anyone. They gave me the power to be financially independent so that I wouldn't have to resort to marrying a rich angmoh just because. 

2. But i still wish to marry a rich angmoh because humans are inherently lazy. I mean I wouldn't mind striking the 12 million TOTO, it's the same kind of feeling. 

3. I set my standards high because I am brought up with lots of love. My parents, my extended family, my teachers, my friends, they accepted me for who I am, they taught me that life is colourful and meaningful because of who I am. I didn't learn about love from a potential lover, i didn't have to wait for him to tell me that I am worth loving. Love was there before boys came into my life. I am not some village girl with 9 siblings who finally experience love just because a boy texts her goodnight, buys her dinner and promises her a citizenship here. 

4. I set my standards high because the boys I've met taught me that love doesn't work out just because you lower your expectations or have no expectations at all. I didn't expect boys to pay for my meals, i didn't expect them to look like Chris Hemsworth or Song Joongki, i didn't expect them to be 100% truthful to me, i didn't expect them to date me exclusively, i didn't expect them to plan surprises and make restaurant or movie reservations ahead, i didn't expect them to be punctual for our dates. But love is not 1+1=2. I lowered my expectations but it still didn't work out. 

5. But those boys taught me that i need to have high standards because it shows that I love myself. They taught me that when i had to wait 1 hour on every date because they overslept, when they confessed that they were seeing someone else, when they want me to pay exactly half the bill and asked me for even the 5 cents in the split, it still freaking hurts. Maybe the foreigner girl is able to put up with all these because they have been through something worse than being disrespected. To be honest, if i really really need to have my time wasted, i would rather stay at home and face the wall. 

6. I set my standards high but they are realistic. I don't expect the boy to give me the moon and the stars because I'm not Megan Fox or Song Hye Gyo. But why should i continue dating a guy who wishes that i retard into 12 years old mental age and stay contented with everything that he bestowed upon me. Maybe the foreigner girl doesn't have people telling her everyday that she has the full potential to fight and achieve much more than what she has today. 

7. I wish for a partner who believes in the best for me, even if the best means that i'll be more successful than him. I wish that he is open-minded and not ashamed that the girl is more ambitious and more opinionated than him. I wish that he will admire me for things that i am capable of and see me as an equal who is able to share burdens with him. Is this too much to ask for in a Singaporean boy who grew up with the same privileges as me? And i don't think going into my 30s or 40s will make me want to hurry and change these wishes... 

8. You are who you attract. I didn't have the high expectations in point 7 and I ended up with liars, cheaters and cowards. If you are a Singaporean guy who is insecure and blames Singaporean girls for having high standards and a sense of entitlement, why not raise your own standards and work towards being a better person so that you can attract the girls with high stardards? 

9. I sincerely wish you look like Chris Hemsworth or Song Joongki because there is a chance you will attract Singaporean girls despite being who you are. I will also suck thumb and take this post back and let you complain about Singaporean girls."

63507,"Anyone could give some insights to the part time degree programme in local uni?

I am accepted in two part time degree courses - com science in NTU and business IT in SUSS.

I studied engineering course in Poly and would like to pursue an IT course in Uni. I learnt some IT modules during Poly however the modules wasn't covered in-depth, hence Im not sure if I am good in IT as I think I am not a fast learner.

Would like to know if it would be a better option to choose ntu or suss? 

NTU - Pros: 1) course more recognized - also com science is quite a general degree as most IT jobs accept com science degree hence lead to more options for me in terms of the job career path 2) school more reputable 3) sch fees is cheaper. Cons: 1) most likely level of difficulty is higher compared to SUSS's 2) tough competition as heard the bell curve is marked together with the full time students 3) distance home is far and inconvenient.

SUSS - Pros: 1) As my IT skills isn't as good, the business IT course would be more favourable for me as the technical aspect is not as much compared to com science in ntu 2) able to learn some business stuff 3) level of difficulty might nt be as high 4) slightly lesser competition as there isn't any bell curve or the bell curve might be just marked against the part time students 5) distance home is nearer as compared to ntu
Cons: 1) school fees is more expensive 2) Business IT course would mean that the modules covered in both business & IT are not in-depth enough? Hence it could be hard for me to go into something specialized as compared to com science in ntu. 

Any advice or seniors studying part time degree would like to help me in this decision would be great. Thank you!"
63506,"Have some questions

Met this girl via some random part time job for abt 2 weeks. Shes in chem while im in soc. 

We talked and i felt the chemistry was there. She looks me in the eye, disturbs me, talks to me etc.

Then we started following each other on instargram. I didnt had to initiate the convo, sometimes she initiates. 

Despite all this, we never really hung out together as a pair. My offer to driver her home or buy supper for her was rejected by her

Then came one fine day, she behave stone cold towards me, replying me one worded messages which she has never done before.

When i ask if i did anything wrong, she unfollowed me on insta without replying me. I subsequently did the same thing back.

Question is: was all this just friendliness from the start, or there was a spark but that didnt ignite? 

Next question:do you think i should restart talking to her?( i really like her)"
