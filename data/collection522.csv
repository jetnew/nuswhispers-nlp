52297,"Because we don’t have any labels, I don’t have the rights to expect any care from you, nor do I have the rights to express my feelings and say anything that can potentially hold you back. Even though it means that there are things you will never know, I think it’s better that you leave and go back to the place where your heart really lies."

52295,"[Trying without words] 

People have different ways of letting go,
Be it by finding another person, 
Be it by seeing you as a foe.
Or find within them, a reason. 

Being planted in a foreign environment, 
Tested my determination and resistance. 

I am trying very hard, 
As I've been since the start. 
The tornado of emotions you cast upon me,
The chains of your attention not setting me free. 

I've told myself ""I'd let go"" again and again, 
But each time with an intent to pretend.

It's all in my head, no one will know, 
I whispered to myself, bent my waist and took a bow.
You don't know the struggles within me, 
You don't know the extent of agony, you
Put me through. 

But it's not your fault for existing, and being nice, and giving me your time, and smiling sweetly.
Its not your fault for being so keenly, 
Into her. 
It's my fault for these I see.

I want you to like me, 
I want you not. 
I want you to be beside me, 
I want you not. 

I want to make you smile, 
I want to erase your frowns. 
I want to walk with you for miles
And miles and miles. 

Though manly, you pms daily, 
Scrunchy faces and subzero sentences, 
A bad reaction I fear
With each interaction that's near. 

Nagustuhan kita, 
Je t'aimais bien.
naega dangsin-eul joh-a, 
Tôi đã thích bạn.

I used to recall times where it's only you and me,
Faces that I've made you shown to me. 
Seconds and only minutes it may be, 
Etched deep within my memory.

Your proximity made this pathetic heart throbbed, 
it could be the norm for you. 
But, for me it's very new.

I've never admitted to myself I had a crush, 
I thought I was strong enough to simply brush, 
It off. 

I don't expect you to ever like me,
Not even in my imagination would I dare to. 
I don't do these for your attention, rather, 
To let go. 

Finally I think it's time, 
For the feelings to sublime.
I've learnt to not subject myself to homosapiens' judgment,
A painful lesson well learnt.

So don't hate me for the disgusting reactions, 
Lime like emotions and differences.
I'm simply learning to let it go, 
In a lesson you're teaching me. 

And when I do learn, 
To accept you and her, 
It'll all be back to normal.

Could be as fast as the otters we saw, 
Could be as slow as the snails we thaw.
Lies."

52292,"I am one of those grads who unfortunately didnt managed to get a proper job after graduation. Frankly speaking , it was because I suck and I admit it.

Took up a 1 yr contract role and it has been over 6 months, they paid decently well so I feel comfortable for the time being.

Here ‘s the puzzle which I cant solve.. I feel I did a good job as I tried very hard and worked smart , should I ask for conversion now (6 months for now) or stick it till end of the contract.

It bothers me alot into thinking that they may just renew until they dont need the headcount anymore and I feel very anxious abt it. This is imperative as their decision will shape how I allocate my time in the next 6 months.

Pls provide me with some gd advice. To be honest , I really dont wan to wait till the end to be rejected if they dont even plan to give a headcount in the first place."

Because we don't have any labels, I don't have the rights to expect any care from you, nor the rights to say anything to hold you back. Even though it means that there are things you'll never know, I still have to let you go to that place where your heart really lies."

52282,"There are two types of people when reacting to a fire drill.

The first are those who will get out of their rooms quickly and go downstairs. These people have proper sense of urgency in the face of an emergency situation, and already know where the gathering point is. They do not wait for their RAs to chase them down, but might even be the ones helping the RAs to clear the floor and take attendance.

The second are those who embrace the sweet, sweet release of firey death and an end to their suffering.

Based on tonight's events, it looks like 90% of Tembusu and USP students are in the latter category."
52281,"I was around Central Library earlier today and there happened to be performances at the forum under NUS Arts Festival (I think). There was this group playing with barely any audiences and I'm just writing cause I feel like they deserve so much more attention! Not too sure about their name, the guy introduced them as nab quartet or nap quartet or something (couldn't find anything when I tried searching that), but anyway they sounded absolutely amazing?! Like, my mind was completely blown, it sounded like super difficult music but it was also super tight and exciting :O But the best thing was that they looked so immersed and like they were having so much fun, and that was really drawing me in. Would appreciate if anyone could link the band here!"

This has been happening for the past 3 years and I want to initiate a convo but will it be weird??

52276,"Hi, I'm the writer of #52276 and I have read your comments on my dilemma. Thanks for all the feedback its been really insightful!

Anyways I just wanted to put across a point or two in response. Sorry to the guy from another uni (who is in medicine btw hahaha:) if I've hurt you with my naivety:( I didn't mean to come off as a dumbass and if it means anything, is it alright if you continue advising me? I'm really at a loss and maybe its best to hear from someone so obviously passionate about his course. After all, what better way is there to learn than to ask someone who is probably ""as bright as (he) thinks he is!""

However, please bear in mind I still hope to get into NUS! I know the requirements are different in both schools, but I'm really more inclined to NUS (much more established in my opinion). If its possible, could you clarify if your advise is more suited for NUS or NTU? Thanks so much for your time and hope to hear from you soon!:)

P.S. please reference this post admin I don't want to trouble people to think this is a rant:p"

52273,"Ok so there got this guy who I was interested in.. and we talked like a lot for several months, texting till midnight having heart2heart chats everyday about life. Thing is he never really initiate anything or like ask me out after school . Then one day he stopped talking to me and doesn’t reply any of my messages anymore. Quite weird la, cos I’m pretty sure I didn’t do anything to make him pissed off or mad at me. Kind of shocking to see some people like that existing?i was quite upset as we got really close to becoming something, yet it just ended like that with no explanation or stuff. So I took it that hes not really interested in me in the end, but what I was angst about was that he led me on and during the period we were close I really felt that there was some attraction between us..."

Why do you need to ask so flustered and bothered, and desperate.
To me, you are just a stranger who came out of somewhere and you expect that someone is obliged to fall for you when you never even talked to him? If so, then what is your motive in the first place. Don’g Give yourself excuses to be deluded in infatuation. The guy you like is the image of the guy you build up in your fantasies, pas moi."

52252,"I feel trapped.

I broke up a year ago with my girlfriend, who wasn't happy with being together. Fast forward to now, and she's happy with someone else. Meanwhile, I'm still mired in the past. Thinking about what I could have done wrong, and what could have been.

I know I should move on. I haven't managed to do it, though.

The self esteem problems that came about from that relationship have ended up with me messing up my chances with promising relationship prospects. Each failure only sets my mindset back further. Perhaps I should just give up and free myself from this endless cycle? I feel trapped.

I've considered ending it many a time. But I can't. I won't let my parents bury their child.

52251,"Having seen both teams running for NUSSU, only the opposition team who have called themselve Concerned Students have actually made an effort to reach out and answer all the questions and roasts thrown at them while the incumbent have done nothing but promote themselves on social media.

52248,"Why do guys (or girls) find fwbs, or random one night stands, or even prostitutes to lose their virginity to someone who don't mean anything to them? I mean sex is great and it's their own life, their own virginity and sexual organs they can do whatever they want with them but I just don't think the thought of casually sleeping around is nice at all. If it's like a steady partner it's fine cos at least you know it's someone who mean something to you. At least next time when you tell that to your future s/o, it will hurt less. I mean nobody would want an S/O who had multiple casual partners before right? And it's not right to lie to them too. Unless that's the kind of relationship you're looking for. 

Once again, I have no right to judge, just trying to advise ppl to save it for someone special or at least try not to be a beast (i know we're young and always ready to go but still... try to refrain and think of your future one). There's always other ways to ""release"" such stress.

PS. Before you guys start commenting saying that i'm a single and lonely or my bf/gf doesn't want to give it to me that's why i'm saying all these, no i'm none of the above. All I'm gonna say is i'm actually speaking from experience. But then again, it's your life, your youth, your choice, none of my business :) "
52247,"I was very close to this guy for the past few months. He asked me out for meals a couple of times, took effort to plan and offered to pay for all expenses each time. We also chatted on a daily basis till very late at night. We were already good friends to begin with so is he doing all these because we are good friends or does he have feelings for me? "

52245,"Recently, there was this rich Japanese guy I followed (I've since unfollowed and blocked him) on Instagram posted a story in which he claimed that guys who wear SAF admin shirt outside NS are ""disgusting"" and chided them as ""poor"" that they can't afford to buy other clothes. 

I have not worn SAF admin shirt ever since I ORD but I do wear SAF singlets at home which are quite comfortable. I'm not a huge fan of NS, I wasn't a high-flyer, but I still must say I like SAF singlets. 

So I replied to his story ""What's your prob?"" 

Then he just got triggered, overreacted, and verbally attacked me this and that and making other vile personal attacks on me, saying that I must be too poor to wear SAF shirt. 

Of course I was angry and I attacked him back and blocked him.  

Then he screenshot the fighting conversations and posted on his Instagram and his Whatsapp group/s. 

Then one of his female friend whom was a stranger to me also started making personal attacks on me and messaged me. She doesn't even know me! 

Obviously they said that I'm a poor loser who can't afford to buy clothes that I can only wear SAF shirts. Like who are these people? They don't even serve NS. Ridiculous. 

Just a rant. Thanks for reading.

52244,"Long story short - my mother passed away. And my father (who is a big time jerk) has married another China  woman.
