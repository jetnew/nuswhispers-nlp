55495,"I am from Btech. Whom usually class at evening. Mostly all are here working guys. After class everyone rushing back from school. On weekend everyone spend time for there family or others. I come to school and feel very alone to study. No one has to discuss about study matter. Usually I try to call most of my classmates. Everyone is busy. Only can see them just one hour before exam. On the other hand. Full time students get more opportunities to make friendship. They can discuss each other about study. They can participate various school activities but we can't.  I feel very disappointed to all of my btech friends. Getting education does not mean coming to school just only for certificates. Getting education is much more than certificates. I am disappointed to scale, and following department as well. Even same module as full students. Same lectures  as well as same question papers. Why so unfair? It's supposed to be same platform to meet with full time students who taking same module. Than we can have opportunities to meet with full time students make new friends and exchange knowledge and experience. Last few years got clinics sessions before exam. Now a days no more clinical session as well. I feel very very alone and feeling, ""I am studying here for just getting a certificates not education"" "

55489,"Dueet has only one day to live. Aiken, his dear comrade, stood by his bed for the past 1231 hours. With the last of his remaining strength, Dueet has decided to play a game with Aiken. He took a 6-sided dice, and rolled it. However, he kept the dice inside his bands, peeking at the number inside. With his very last breath, he uttered the number “6.” Then, he passed on. Aiken decided to pry open Dueet’s hands. It was a 5. Dueet had lied.

Near towards the end of the finals, Aiken was struggling to finish the paper. He had only 30 minutes to complete the rest of the Open-Ended Questions. Suddenly Dueet popped out of nowhere! His comrade was here! He patted his shoulder, comforting him in the midst of his demise. He then told him the secret message to help him pass his CS1231 finals.

In the end, Aiken filled all the blanks with the answer:”

55472,"Whenever I try to strike up conversation with other students, they seem remarkably good at killing said conversation. I get answers like ""idk"", ""maybe"", and even ""oh I just like it haha"" to the question ""why do you like/have that?"". 

It's often me who is asking the questions, bringing up new topics into the conversation, basically tanking the convo. Most people give me low-effort replies that completely halt the natural flow. Sometimes I can talk better with groupmates, but once the project ends, they go back to avoiding convo with me. 

I wonder if this is a cultural thing-- I remember the exchange student's post about constantly getting curt replies or silence, and someone else telling me it isn't like that in Southern Europe. But maybe, it is simply that others wish to avoid talking to me in particular. I think most people are capable of good conversation. I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong, that makes everyone wish to avoid me.

I don't know if this info is relevant, but I'm not a feminine girl. Mind you, I just want to make freinds, and their gender doesn't matter. But from the posts here, it seems like men spent a lot of their energy staring at, whining about, contemplating, fantasising, and struggling to romantically confess to feminine girls. So maybe they also prefer befriending feminine girls, because then they can cling onto the hope of the friendship becoming a relationship? I wouldn't know. For other girls, I'm having no luck befriending those either. "

I started Pharmacy this year, expecting it to have some balance between logic thinking, calculations and memorising facts. However, approaching the end of semester 1, I saw that it is much more memorising than other aspects. Also, it's more on the Chem side than Bio side, which might be my fault for not looking into it really closely. Pharmacy seniors, will the upcoming years be the same, much memorising? 

If it is, can someone please suggest another major that has the mentioned balance?

Not sure which major you are in, but if you already know that the mods cannot be S/U-ed, why are you asking this question? Why did you not put in the effort during the semester? There is a reason why the university does not publish what happens if a student fails core modules that cannot be S/U-ed, which is to prevent students from acting smart and thinking they can game the system and get a better grade on their second attempt. What, think you can jump from a Fail grade(whichever ones they are) and get an A grade on the second attempt?"

55435,"Hey NUS people, I'm an exchange student and after a semester here, I've grown to love this uni. One thing really intrigues me though. I stay in a residential college and it is a habit (in my country) for me to say good morning to everyone I see in the elevator when I'm heading to breakfast or to class. Sometimes, while walking to class, I would make eye contact with people passing by, and give them a slight smile. I wonder whether it is seen as creepy or rude to do it in Singapore because I have never gotten a response to a smile and a good morning greeting would make the rest of the elevator ride really awkward. Singaporeans would shift their eyes away from me or take out their phone to escape the awkwardness. It is always other exchange students who reciprocate favorably.

On my first week here, I approached a local student at Business and asked her where is the best place to eat on campus (because I thought she was cute and wanted to talk to her). She gave me the most curt reply and hurried away from me in the opposite direction. After that, I realized that talking to strangers is something really uncommon here. I usually ask strangers for recommendations whenever I am in a new city and I felt really weird doing it in Singapore. 

It is my first time in Asia and I found out that people are generally kind and open once you get to know them better but close to 100% of the students here are shy with strangers. Is it just me or do you guys feel the same way too? Also, if no one dares to hit on girls on the shuttle bus/ around campus, how do locals even meet girls?

55413,"The past couple of weeks as finals and deadlines came and passed by, I realised that inadvertently, I have developed feelings for a friend. It all started when I saw a video of some Korean Drama, the female lead was beaming with happiness as she smiled. I found myself smiling too as I got reminded of my friend's cute smile during some event we attended together months ago.

Ever since then, I keep getting flashbacks of her, from small little things she did that was dumb then but somehow now it felt cute to me as I remember them, to other things like asking me for help instead of easily searching Google for answers. I see interesting things and funny memes and the first thing I can think of is wanting to share with her. Occasionally she randomly appears on my mind when I am studying for finals.

She probably just see me as another one of her friends. I think that she actually has someone she likes too. I have no intention of letting her know about my feelings, I am happy staying near just as a friend. Perhaps as an evergreen I am afraid of rejection, but deep down I am more worried about losing someone close. After all, as long as she is happy, that is enough for me.

Dating has been interesting; but hard because whilst most guys say they want an independent girl, but yet can’t seem to really handle it.

 I only realised that when my dad jokingly asked ""you should put on a seatbelt, you want to die isit?"" to which I answered ""haha no"" but I thought to myself ""...that actually wouldnt be too bad..""

I love what im studying, i love my family, and i love myself. And nothing will change that. Life is good. And logic dictates that I should feel happy, because I have nothing to be sad about. But here I am, wondering if a potted plant fell on my head and killed me, I wouldnt be too upset about it.

Isnt that so selfish of me? I dont think im depressed per se. Im just losing interest in things that i used to love like spending time with friends, or studying (abit of a nerd here) or even going on a holiday. I dwell in mind-numbing stuff like youtube (urgh) and just staring into blank spaces.
