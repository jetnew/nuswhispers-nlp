61899,"The fact that there are STILL people supporting the culprit of the recent sexual harassment saga is appalling. He deserves everything that has happened, given how the school and spf haven’t rly punished him enough. If you were the victim, you will know how sad it is when people start showing concern for the culprit rather than you, even though you were not the one to start the whole incident . "
61898,"""For those not up to date. A circular was sent out:

DEAN OF STUDENTS’ CIRCULAR – SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
 
I want to begin with this unequivocal message – the University does not tolerate sexual misconduct in any form. We believe that every case of sexual misconduct must be investigated, and offenders must be disciplined. We are fully committed to strengthening and expanding the infrastructure, policies and procedures to investigate cases of sexual misconduct and to take strong disciplinary action.  
 
Our focus must always be to further educate students, faculty and staff about respect, consent, bystander intervention, and the support available to survivors of sexual misconduct.
 
We are sorry for the distressing experience cited recently by one of our students, which is of extreme concern to us. We have reached out to her to offer our support and assistance.
 
The offence committed was serious and has been investigated by the Police, who gave the male student a 12-month conditional warning.
 
When such offences are committed, the NUS Board of Discipline, which comprises student and faculty representatives, also conducts its own disciplinary proceedings.
 
It will consider factors such as the severity of the offence, the need for justice for the victim, the rehabilitative needs of the student offender, the safety of the NUS community, and also the decisions and penalties imposed by the authorities.
 
Our disciplinary sanctions, which are not a substitute for criminal proceedings, can include immediate suspension and expulsion, and/or an official reprimand, with the record of offences and sanctions documented in the student’s formal educational records.  The offences and penalties are made available online to all students to view at the end of each semester. You may view this on the NUS Student Portal.
 
We hear your concerns about having a safer and more supportive campus environment.
 
NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye will convene a committee to review the current student disciplinary and support frameworks. This committee, which will have representation from the NUS Board of Trustees, will study the approaches taken by other international institutions, and solicit views from you, your parents and other stakeholders. The review is intended to tighten the penalty system for offences that affect the safety of our campuses. We will share the findings of this study and follow up actions with you in the new academic year. 
 
There will be two student representatives on this committee – we invite interested students to send their names and contact details to osasec@nus.edu.sg by 28 Apr 19.
 
We urge you to immediately report all instances of sexual misconduct, which will be escalated to trained colleagues at the Office of Campus Security (OCS) for investigation. We have also put in place special investigation and disciplinary procedures to manage suspected cases of sexual misconduct to ensure confidentiality, timeliness and survivor care.
The 24-hour OCS hotline is +65 6874 1616. They can also be reached on email at ocssec@nus.edu.sg. 
 
We will do everything we can to ensure that you are safe and supported during your time with us.""

TLDR: Email osasec@nus.edu.sg to sign up and have the chance to give your input. I myself am graduating so I may not be able to meet their requirements but we need people to step up.

61895,"not sure if everyone else understands fully, but it would be great to get some clarification. if both the perp and victim are NUS students, how would a case usually go? 

1. Victim reports to NUS only: does the police get involved at all? from what's being said, seems like NUS encourages victims not to report to the police, and to leave it to the NUS disciplinary board.

2. Victim reports to police only: does the police inform/communicate with the school? 

3. Victim reports to both NUS and the police: do both organisations mete out separate punishments, and do they take each other's punishments into consideration? from the recent case, it appears that the police worked with the school to mete out the punishment, and the police almost defers to NUS. 

given the current NUS stance, it appears that it would be better for a victim to go to the police directly and bypass the school."

Oh no, it sounds like I was approached by this guy too. I know it's him because he meows and he's a maths grad student. I just saw this on NUSWhispers by chance, and before this I didn't know that other people had similar experiences. I don't think I was harassed enough to make a case, but I hope sharing will help others stay safe and know that they're not alone. 

I first encountered him in April 2017 in Utown. I don't wanna reveal details that will let him know it's me, but I remember a few odd things about that first meeting: 

- He kept pestering me for my number or other contact, saying ""otherwise how would I meet you again?"" Over the next few weeks I got messages from him asking to meet up, but I just kept saying no.
- The conversation got a bit too close for comfort very quickly. He kept saying I'm chio, I'm special, I'm just like his fiancee etc. And ""I was just like you when I was your age""
- He knew I was attached, but still wanted to meet up for ""study dates"" and said I don't have to tell my boyfriend. I got super uncomfortable
- He asked if I was a virgin, twice
- He just seemed very preoccupied with getting an undergrad girlfriend. He was upfront about going around the university to look for girls, and asked me to refer him to single girls if I know any
- He talked about how he objectifies girls and ranks them by their attributes. When I brought up how it's uncomfortable for a girl to feel objectified, he said he saw no problem with it

In the end, after enough pestering I got pissed off and just told him firmly, no means no, I'm not responding to any more messages. It was freaky enough that I avoided Utown for about a year. 

Reading the confessions here, I guess I'm lucky I got away safely. Thanks to everyone who shared, you helped me realise it wasn't just me, and hopefully it helps other girls in NUS too. "
61889,"OP of #61889 here. Just want to say thanks to the guy who commented on my post, Jonathan Choi. I’m only able to do 10% of what you said cos I really really suck at talking to girls. But it worked! Got myself a date for Endgame after exams! Thanks man! "
61887,Would like to know if it is possible to register for modules in special term while still marked as 'Exchange' in the system(supposedly). Intention is to do Special Term Part 2 immediately after the end of exchange.
61882,"The judicial system was put into place so that we as a community do not have to experience injustice. And without a doubt the school should have given a punishment that matches the crime. Okay we all know that. 

So what I really want to talk about is about humanity. You are right that he deserves a harsher punishment, you are right that he should be condemned by us all, but in a world where we are so caught up with being right, sometimes we might have forgotten to be kind. It will not pain me to see him getting his deserved punishment, and this is not about him or them but about us as a community. It really makes me very heartbroken to see us becoming so merciless. 

I know everyone feels the injustice and that’s good, but I feel that only when we are put into a difficult position like this, in a position of strength to determine someone’s fate, then it truly becomes a test of character. 

I really hope that in general, disregarding this incident, we can become a kinder society.  "
61880,"I am starting to get a little anxious as I have not receive a offer into FASS for the new AY. Looking at the IGP released, i assumed that my GPA as a polytechnic student will be able to secure me a place easily. Is admission into FASS that competitive? Is the IGP accurate since it stated for the whole of Social Science and not for each major?"
61879,"Hi, I’m going to be matriculating as a freshmen this coming August in the Chem Eng Program. With the recent news, I’m really worried that I’ll one day end up stressed and go around filming in toilets. I have also read on NUSWhispers other chem eng students are making headlines for the wrong things. For a course that used to be AAA/A, it seems like it’s not so prestigious and random tom harry and unethical dicks can be admitted. Should I request to change course? I feel that it would be quite embarrassing if I told someone I was a chemical engineering grad from NUS."
61878,"I have always relied a lot on external validation. In the past my mood will swing according to whether I score well for exams or not, whether boys in school like me or not. And when I experienced a breakup, the feeling is terrible. I also tend to compare with people around me to see if i am “better than them” in terms of grades, salary, their social life, if they are attached, if I am prettier than them. If i am I will be happy, if I am not I will be devastated. Because of my severe need of external validation, my mood tends to fluctuate from super happy to super sad in a short time or vice versa. Why am I like this?"
61877,"In regard to #61877 (the OP who said she just wants a simple life after studying for many years and completing uni);

Not sure if anyone is in the same position. I'm female and my family background is quite humble so I grew up with a lot of unfulfilled wants. As a result, I am very fearful about not having enough money and became quite career-oriented. I often go the extra mile at my job, but I'm under constant fear about under-performing over every little hiccup. 

I don't enjoy my life because everyday I'm thinking of what my bosses think of me today, what I can do to get the next increment or promotion. It's unhealthy and I don't want to just sprint through these 10 years to wake up at 35 with grey hair (I'm a woman, so that's not cool :'( )and realise that my best years are already behind me. 

Furthermore, my SO is a very kind man who likes kids but I am so fearful of the future (what if I can't give my kid ""enough""? will they have to choose between being kind but mediocre, vs being competitive but successful? will they have to work even harder than me to attain my current standard of living? can I support them while also saving for my retirement?) that I can't see myself as a mum while my other friends look ready to pop one within the next 2 years. My SO jokingly says that my brain is 'damaged' because I grew up poor and financially insecure.

Is there anyone who felt the same as me in middle/late 20s but eventually got through this period? How did it happen? "
61873,Hi I am writing with strong disappointment regards to the email this morning sent by NUSSU regards to the sexual harassment case. How can you publicly state the name of the victim? This behaviour is strongly unacceptable not only from a students view but as a Human Being! You have absolutely no sense of what is privacy! Moreover you mentioned that victims are encouraged to report to NUS. For what? For you to tell the whole world the victim has been harassed sexually?
61869,"I agree that more support can and should be given to the victim. But to everyone saying NUS should take a 'stronger stance', what stronger stance is it supposed to take? NUS should not be the arbiter or ANY criminal offense. Expulsion? Do you all think criminals should be stripped of their right to education? Society shouldn’t be allowed to go around taking away people’s education for their sins. That’s just ensuring that these people become a burden to society for the remainder of their lives. "
61866,Im a non-cs student and I am interested in developing a video game engine from scratch. Do you think its possible any NUS student done this feat before? How was your experience?
61865,"Is nus library portal for exam papers down for anyone else? I'm unable to search for any exam ppers >:(

61863,"I think not just the computers at PC commons are not working but also the ones in MAC commons. On a side note, can those people who are studying at PC commons please be considerate and dont leave your belongings there for like more than 1 hour? Referring to a specific group of people :)"
61861,"OK neutral party here on the Monica baey thing. I get that Nus should convene and that she is just voicing out. But does anyone else here feels that she's getting a bit too happy over the whole incident and maybe there's something more than just change and justice that she wants? I mean come on, with stuff like ""mom, I'm on the news"". I don't feel it's anything to be proud of and if anything, this is borderline milking the whole saga for fame. "
61860,"While I applaud her courage to press for change, I personally feel that she presented a very biased view of how NUS handled the case, and that she may be too irrational now. If you have been following the details closely, NUS has actually punished the boy more than sufficiently by suspending him for 1 sem, giving him an official letter of reprimand, making him go for counselling and rehab and do 30 hours of corrective work. The incident had also been reported to the police, but there was probably insufficient evidence to jail him. This shows that NUS has already done its part, so please stop blaming the school. I agree that more can be done to help victims, but I strongly urge all of you to read up what happened in detail instead of expressing your anger on the school irrationally based on what you see on your friends' instagram stories. "
61859,"in light of the recent incident about sexual harassment and statements put out by various parties, including NUSSU, i was very puzzled by point 6 as written by them. Reproduced here: 

""6.	NUSSU Exco also recognises, that as opposed to a criminal court, that rehabilitation is an extremely strong principle in how student offenders are treated in the Board of Discipline, given that NUS is an educational institution. NUSSU Exco also notes that the Board of Discipline had acted in accordance with existing precedent and due process, and respects that the decision by the Board was arrived at in good faith.""

This left me with a lot of confusion about how things are handled as per the school's regulations. As a result, I came up with this table to help myself understand potential combinations of titles and location of such an act. I'm not a law student and neither am I trained legally in any way, so I was hoping if anyone here could help me out and fill in the blanks?

I just want to seriously understand this matter. Thank you.

61856,"REPLY TO #61802: 

I was quietly watching this page and this reply to mrbtech is actually the MOST SALTY reply to this whole shenanigan. I cannot take it, must reply back to all university students and to this individual.

Eh dude, firstly I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. You ought to blame yourself for being academically bad. Your failure becomes the world's fault now, for INFLUENCING YOU. 20 over years old and in a university and now you cannot decide what is right or wrong. Still want to be hired in a good company earning good pay?

Seriously who the hell cares about you scoring the best marks in JC and all your ridiculous competitions, volunteers and representation achievements when you scored a 2.88 despite all these. It only shows that you CHOOSE to participate in all the random activities but REFUSE to put in effort in your academics. Since when joining a company don't need to have good results? Besides lousy results, you want to showcase your awesome CCA achievements. Your awesome CCA achievements cannot even justify your technical ability lor. 

You think leadership comes without knowledge one ah? 2.88 want to be a manager earning 4.5k? Wait long long lor please, this is sinkapore. You want to earn 4.5k? Be a sales engineer and chiong lor. This field you need to chiong and hustle to earn the big bucks since you don't have the knowledge.

Sorry lor you don't have the white horse life where you can kiao ka and enjoy in the family business. Then all the worst you have to work hard right?

Eh please la the bunch of you really writing out of context to shame that OP. You want good pay good life then you study hard and be good in your studies first. If you score badly, you will definitely be filtered out. But once you enter the workplace it is a whole new ball game.

ISN'T THIS WHAT THE OP WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS? GOSH! 

Admin: Please don't filter this. You have a bunch of students here who refuse to accept the harsh truth and some more they like to selectively read and rage then negatively portraying the giss of the argument all along. Disagreeing to agree.  "
61855,"Noticed that netizens are upset with NUS’s handling of the recent Nicholas Lim/Monica Baey saga. But why ain’t people angry at how the police handled it too? Shouldn’t the police also be made to clarify their stance? I’m sure there are a few news report of people committing similar crimes and actually have been given an actual criminal record, with legit punishment). In this case, the police only gave him a conditional warning, which basically means nothing. And this is when there are evidences of him filming a naked lady showering?!

I have been a victim of upskirt photo/video before. I only had a few hours of sleep before the incident and hence I led my guard down; it didn’t come across to me that it doesn’t quite make sense for somebody to stand close behind me on an escalator during off-peak hours. I was maybe 15 seconds late in sensing something was wrong and when I looked behind me, the prepetrator have already been using his phone on me. FYI my dress length was below my knee so don’t victim-blame me. I confronted him while we were still on the escalator and proceeded to singlehandedly nab him after he denied my accusation yet refused to let me check his phone, which was in camera mode and he gave ran. There was CCTVs around that filmed the whole incident, multiple witnesses of the public and police when they saw me fighting against the man. Despite all of these, the police told me that I’ve already gotten the best deal possible since they’re deporting him (that man is a foreigner on visiting pass) because they only found photos/videos of my upskirt i.e. first offence. I felt that it wasn’t a heavy-enough punishment, as he could have at least been jailed for a few weeks before getting deported? Especially when there are concrete evidences and the actual victim was there to give fresh first-hand recount etc. Yet the police told me to let go of this. Till this day, I’m still very paranoid of taking escalators alone and even just being alone in public.

In this case, the victim had it worse than me (she wasn’t even clothed at all) yet the prepetrator’s punishment was non-existent, which doesn’t make sense at all. I really hope that the police would revise their punishment of Nicholas Lim... As for why I’m writing this here, I’m too chicken to bring this up to public whatsoever. Nobody except my immediate family and boyfriend knows about my upskirt incident and even at that time, my parents blamed me for wearing a dress (despite it being long). I feel ashame that I am a victim for something like that and I’ve been made to feel that it’s my fault by my parents and the police."
61852,"Given the recent saga on guys trespassing toilets of hostel, do you think it's time that each hall should be restricted to a single gender? Opposite gender found in the hall will be subjected to harsh penalties (fines, suspension, termination of studies). This is the only way which we can prevent future incidents like this."

That being said, I personally don't think it's always helpful to bank on a specific set of grades when it comes to percentile-based criteria (which the dean's list is based on), though hopefully this information will help with managing expectations. All the best! "
61849,"#61849 OP here: For those interested in my double life in a sugar relationship:
- No, in fact, he encourages me to date other men, especially men my age. Exclusivity is not a term between us. However, I have never being in a proper BGR, my experiences has always been with SDs and lovers. Should I have a BF, I would want to be faithful to him. 
- Arrangements either goes by monthly allowances or Pay Per Meet. Personally, I only accept monthly payments. He provides for my living expenses and tuition fees. Though I have a proper part time job drawing $1k monthly while studying, it's insufficient. 
- Not always. I know a particular dude who was once a high end male escort and had women taking care, grooming him to be a successful (wealthy) individual. Now, he's 'paying forward' to help girls out ???? But I have to say such cases are rare especially for a male. He's charming and intellectual to begin with, he just get resources in such a quicker method. 
Am lucky to meet my current SD and we've been together for 1.5years. Neither the wealthiest nor most good looking, but well off and decent looking. Respectful and caring so far. We do activities together: swimming, reading books, having McD at 3am. I have met public figures before and most are petty douchebags!

61845,"Here's a story:

There was a conflict between a 2 members of a group project. The guy complained that the girl was not contributing to the project. The girl claims that the guy harrassed her. 
This case was brought up to their teachers and school. Nothing much happened to the guy, he went on with his usual life. The girl was counseled, brought to the hospital and kept in the mental ward for days. She was then suspended for the rest of the semester.
They told her hush hush, don't make a fuss of this small matter. The same thing they told to many other girls. To be given a chance to complete her studies, she chose the only route she could take, one that the many other girls took. Only one other girl decided otherwise.

61844,"Regarding the issue about the recent incident in the hall near FASS. Now that the school has apologized and reacted to the situation, and with the guy cowering in fear, not being to show his face in public, the victim has gotten her way and I'm happy she has gotten her justice. :>

But I feel a very slight regret in having supported her. Identifying the guy, along with photos of his friends while asking news publishers to cover her story for revenge just wasn't right. I think this is known as doxxing, which is also a criminal offence. She could have at least censored the faces of his friends and maybe even his identity. She has gotten her revenge now that the perpetrator will never be able to step out in society ever again. kinda having mixed feelzz about this.

She had my sympathy at the beginning of this saga, but now it seems the attention is getting to her head - her instastories that just a few days ago borderlined desperation [that baited my sympathy] now stink of arrogance, and for the wrong reasons."

He thinks penetration is enough to get me off although I’ve told him multiple times to try some foreplay. Question: Is he just dense, or selfish or does he totally not care about my feelings? He hasn’t introduced me to any of his friends either:("
61842,"This is the admin of #61703 replying to Mr. BTech who is ""not replying indefinitely"".

If you still do not see the point that I am putting across, assuming that I am a ""emotional teenager"", perhaps your inability to comprehend my argument is the exact reason you spur us on by saying ""grades are not important"".

Old man, our studies do not simply comprise of ""regurgitat(ing) knowledge"". Granted, everybody knows the knowledge you learn in school, regardless of level might not be used for your future job or even tertiary education. The chemistry knowledge I learnt in JC definitely isn't fully applicable to the course I'm studying now. What the education system does succeed in however, is fulfilling the purpose of nurturing critical thinkers. The questions I tacked in A Levels set the foundations on how I should study, problems which come out of it and how I should solve it. Just like in uni, where a firm grasp of knowledge on my major would be a good indication that I can critically think in the field and perhaps contribute to the firm I join. 

More importantly, thank you to #61802 for your insight on the topic. I guess it does take a real life example to show people the reality of the situation, and I wish you all the best in your future career. Bottom line, grades do matter for most jobs as the first point of selection. What comes next (e.g. attitude and ability to work in a firm) will be judged AFTER grades were looked at. Typically, the people who say ""grades don't matter"" either really don't need them cos they are secure in their future, or are just trying to throw you off to study less for the bell curve.

A lot of you have commented (esp the guy who said something along the lines of it depends on what you do). I do acknowledge your point, and I did think about it. You are right by saying that everybody has different aspirations. After all, we cannot have a society full of doctors, just like how we cannot have one full of poets. But that brings me to the point I brought up in my original post. However, what mommy told me at the end of the day makes perfect sense; ""it doesn't matter how well you do, as long as you tried your best"". I admit that maybe me and the other guy might have made results sound like a means to an end. Thats not true, we are just saying that the notion of grades not being important is utter rubbish. At the end of the day however, there will always be people who do better than others. To the people who aren't doing well, as long as they have done their best, thats all that matters. To tell them however, that grades aren't important before they have even tried could lull them into a false sense of insecurity. Instead, EVEN IF WE KNOW that they are not at the top of their class, we should still encourage them to work hard, and the end product does not matter as long as they tried their best.

It might seem confusing but let me summarise my argument. 
(1) Grades do matter, I'm sorry but this reality will be here for a long time. 
(2) Grades are not means to an end. TRY YOUR BEST in whatever you do, thats what is important. If your aim is to be a world-class farmer, take a course related to it (hypothetically), and WORK HARD AT IT.

61841,"To #61765: Senior here from Electrical Engineering. I managed to go for exchange to my first-choice uni with a D and a C+ :) I think a single grade is unlikely to be a deal-breaker, what matters more is the overall strength of your application, e.g. are you likely to: 
- Represent NUS in a good light? 
- Be a good fit for the university/programme you chose? (Is there anything that makes it particularly suitable for you?)
- Appreciate and make the most of your opportunity? (E.g. participate in school/activities, immerse in the culture, make meaningful connections)
- Cope well academically and socially, and graduate on time when back? 

I think you do stand a good chance if you can communicate some of these points in your application. Hope you get in, exchange is a fantastic opportunity :) Good luck! "

The last thing we want to do is make light of this."
61836,"Strongly agree with #61777.

In my honest opinion, in this particular case yes the victim wants justice which is right and proper, but what she feels most sad from what I've been reading seems to be her disappointment and anger that this has happened on more than a few occasions, and in I'm understanding her correctly what she wants most is for the same thing never to happen to anyone else again. Rather than for everyone else to play judge, I think the victim reiterates very clearly that she wants there to be compulsory re-education or community service, which is something within the powers of the school. Again, prison sentences are not within the power of the school nor the police but the courts, and it would be crazy to bring corporal punishment into the university setting.

The suspension by itself unfortunately doesn't go any way to ensuring that there is going to be any change in the mindset and behaviour. It's like going to a 'some sort of therapy centre' (see Youtube and you'll see what I'm talking about), and saying ""It's OK, I'm dealing with this myself, no need for the police."" For some, yes a suspension is good enough for them to reflect on their actions, sincerely make up to the victim and never do it again. But for others who are more stubborn, this will not work. Something more helpful in changing all offenders and be of better use to the victims would be to institute community service & compulsory re-education during that suspension, and with someone (whether it's a counsellor or etc) to track the offender's progress for a full semester to see if the offender is ready to earn his second chance. Random phone spot checks for the offender (again this might be a privacy concern to some but I think at least for the period of his suspension it seems fair) or instituting a curfew for the period of the suspension if it's easier to strike at night.

On the other hand, I've been for rehabilitative measures where possible because I think what brings closure to the victim is that this shit doesn't happen again. You can jail the offender but if he ends up being that 25% of inmates who reoffend despite going through such a harsh punishment what you end up with is a hardened criminal, who may do even worse things in future. Our society still has some way to go in reintegrating former criminals after they complete their sentence, which is why we need to be cautious when we call for jail sentences because 1 in 4 will reoffend. Being tough on crime is one thing, but being tough on the causes of crime is another. You need both to nip the problem in the bud."
61831,"#61793: Can just post it if it is true. so far, i have not heard of any guys suing for defamation when they are a perpetrator of sex crime. they will threaten and hope the victim dont take any action. this is just legal intimidation.  empty threats. 

they definitely wont sue. reason that they will not sue is because: 
1. they did it. 
2. so when it comes to legal proceeding they are at a loss, it cast a very negative light on them. and the whole world will know they did it
3. after losing the civil suit of defamation, they will still face criminal proceedings

they would rather threaten and hope you are intimidated, and dont even report to police.

whatever happens, just report to police and post on social media to warn other potential victims. 

today it is you, tmr it could be someone else. zero tolerance to sex crimes. do not be scared. even if you receive a legal letter, seek counsel, and post.

I don't think I was harassed enough to make a case, but I hope sharing will help others stay safe and know that they're not alone. 

I first encountered him in April 2017 in Utown. I don't wanna reveal details that will let him know it's me, but I remember a few odd things about that first meeting: 

- He kept pestering me for my number or other contact, saying ""otherwise how would I meet you again?"" Over the next few weeks I got messages from him asking to meet up, but I just kept saying no.
- The conversation got a bit too close for comfort very quickly. He kept saying I'm chio, I'm special, I'm just like his fiancee etc. And ""I was just like you when I was your age""
- He knew I was attached, but still wanted to meet up for ""study dates"" and said I don't have to tell my boyfriend. I got super uncomfortable
- He asked if I was a virgin, twice
- He just seemed very preoccupied with getting an undergrad girlfriend. He was upfront about going around the university to look for girls, and asked me to refer him to single girls if I know any
- He talked about how he objectifies girls and ranks them by their attributes. When I brought up how it's uncomfortable for a girl to feel objectified, he said he saw no problem with it

In the end, after enough pestering I got pissed off and just told him firmly, no means no, I'm not responding to any more messages. It was freaky enough that I avoided Utown for about a year. 

Reading the confessions here, I guess I'm lucky I got away safely. Thanks to everyone who shared, you helped me realise it wasn't just me, and hopefully it helps other girls in NUS too. "
61827,"I notice that if you google past cases of molestation or peeping, you actually dont hear what the universities do to their students (you hear the criminal charges but not exactly sure if the students were expelled or anything) 

I only looked at cases from ntu, nus and a surprising lack from smu (awaiting the results of the investigation of the smu one). 

Polytechnics also seem to have slightly different standards from University, is it just me or does the top results on google almost imply that most offenders in polytechnics go to jail rather than the 12 month warning period? (University students SEEM to enjoy this benefit)"
61826,"I need some advice. My boyfriend recently asked me to take better care of myself. I´m pretty relaxed about my looks, wear makeup from time to time. He started behaving weirdly and I pressured him to tell me why and  he told me he has trouble finding me attractive when he sees I am not putting any effort into how I look (which is not completely true). Is this a serious issue? I haven´t changed anything since we started our relationship, why did he start minding it now? I´ve always been like this. Should I break up with him or am I just over reacting? "
61824,Where does one look for a CTO in NUS to startup a company?
61823,It seems like most of the PCs in PC Commons are not functioning. Very frustrated as I've already spoken to tech support over this and they ask for an ID for every computer. But there must be about 15 computers here that don't work. Hopefully someone from NUS will see this and can sort it
61821,hello! asking if there is anyone heading to aarhus for summer school? :)
61819,"I like how the victim's name appeared big big on NUS official statement but the culprit is deemed as a ""the male student"". Can like that one meh? Even gagged order in news is censored the victim's name ma."
61817,"I'm a fan of fair punishment dealt to the perpetrator. I'm not a fan of over-punishing the perpetrator. What's happening is the latter. And scheming to get him punished the way you want is not right.

I feel that the true motive of the victim is clear - She wants cold hard revenge and ""fixing the NUS system"" is just a disguise to boost her campaign and garner support for her case against the perpetrator.

Besides, I greatly doubt that NUS would consider any options she is proposing now, given that she did not first seek recourse from higher authorities in NUS, with people that have the power to make decisions, before seeking media coverage. After all, why would they consider her proposals? She knew very well what she was doing would tarnish the school's reputation.

It's like returning a punch in the face to NUS for mishandling the situation and now dictating what NUS should do lol. Does not sound logical to me.

This is just my opinion.

61811,Hi I am a computer science student planning to minor in Statistics. Any ST32xx modules to recommend that would complement CS? Thank you!!
61809,"I think paradoxically NUS historical indirect condonance of voyeurism by offering lax punishment caused the current public out-lash. Voyeurism has been a feature of halls of residences. It is high time we do something about it. 

But wondering from PR point of view, is there anything that the perpetrator could have done to avoid the current PR disaster?
Perhaps when NUS offered 1 sem suspension, he could have voluntarily increased to two semesters suspension (without option of internship), and offer a non derisive compensation to the victim?

61805,"Recently, I found out that my gf (with me for 2 years) told me that she lost her virginity to a jc teacher when she was J1. I believe its because of the recent saga of toilet filming and other happenings that led her to tell me. At that time, she had no clue what sex was at that point in time and was hoaxed to go to his house (which was near hers) for ""tuition"" on multiple occasions. In fact, that teacher was married at that point in time and their relationship lasted for 6 months. I was enraged. How is it possible that she is so gullible and our school teachers acting like monsters preying on students. She also often spoke highly of that ""teacher"" which I felt terribly disgusted about. I wanted to probe further about the details and ask her to make a police report. But I am also afraid that I might upset her in the process. What should I do?"
61803,"To the poster of #61769: We figured it out after the first time you did it... you only think you're scoring the best within the clique because we all unanimously decided to troll you and tell you our supposed grades over the past 3 years. 
Fun fact: Ever wondered why you got the lowest marks for this sem's group project despite working so hard?

Karma's a bitch"
61802,"REPLY TO #61802: 

I was quietly watching this page and this reply to mrbtech is actually the MOST SALTY reply to this whole shenanigan. I cannot take it, must reply back to all university students and to this individual.

Eh dude, firstly I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. You ought to blame yourself for being academically bad. Your failure becomes the world's fault now, for INFLUENCING YOU. 20 over years old and in a university and now you cannot decide what is right or wrong. Still want to be hired in a good company earning good pay?

Seriously who the hell cares about you scoring the best marks in JC and all your ridiculous competitions, volunteers and representation achievements when you scored a 2.88 despite all these. It only shows that you CHOOSE to participate in all the random activities but REFUSE to put in effort in your academics. Since when joining a company don't need to have good results? Besides lousy results, you want to showcase your awesome CCA achievements. Your awesome CCA achievements cannot even justify your technical ability lor. 

You think leadership comes without knowledge one ah? 2.88 want to be a manager earning 4.5k? Wait long long lor please, this is sinkapore. You want to earn 4.5k? Be a sales engineer and chiong lor. This field you need to chiong and hustle to earn the big bucks since you don't have the knowledge.

Sorry lor you don't have the white horse life where you can kiao ka and enjoy in the family business. Then all the worst you have to work hard right?

Eh please la the bunch of you really writing out of context to shame that OP. You want good pay good life then you study hard and be good in your studies first. If you score badly, you will definitely be filtered out. But once you enter the workplace it is a whole new ball game.

ISN'T THIS WHAT THE OP WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS? GOSH! 

Admin: Please don't filter this. You have a bunch of students here who refuse to accept the harsh truth and some more they like to selectively read and rage then negatively portraying the giss of the argument all along. Disagreeing to agree.  "
61801,"Just wondering, what would be the recommended punishment for voyeurism? 

Note that there's a distinction between punishment as a violation of criminal law,  and actions you want the university to take. "
