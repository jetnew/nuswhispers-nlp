52899,"im the one who posted #52888, and i cant believe someone is as shallow to point out that people only apply to medicine for honour/prestige.

I dont think there is much honour or prestige working that many long hours and getting your hands so dirty. 

I want it for i know i can wake up everyday and tell myself that this is the best way i can spend my short 70ish years on earth. 

i dont care for how much money i can earn, as far as minimum life requirement goes, im only concerned with not starving to death while being able to have a meaningful life.

you are not helpful to people with poor self esteem like us."
52896,"For the first time in my life, I actually feel like cutting myself. Sliding the blade through my flesh and feeling the pain. At least I would feel something other than this indignance from this shitty situation I am in"

52893,"My handwriting is on the messy side and it's not for want of trying. Different people's motor skill are different and we should accept that. In fact earlier the year I was hospitalised for brain damage and couldn't control one side of the body. Fortunately I recovered in a few weeks. So I understand that precision in motor skill is just beyond some of us in terms of writing.

On the other hand, some people are plain lazy. They tell me that last time their handwriting was messy but after being scolded by a teacher and practicing, they can now produce nice words. Good for them, but please do not assume it is the same for everybody who continues to struggle with handwriting. 

For me, and to all those who have large calligraphic strokes, a tip would be to use pencil instead of pen so that you can see the stroke direction based on the thickness. In my personal notes I no longer concern myself with tidiness. Rather I look at the stroke direction instead of the shape of the word. It has brought me great relief in my life to know and accept that I cannot come up with neat letters unlike some other people."

52891,"What's up with the PCs at the ERC? Every time I log in, it gets stuck at the 'Preparing Windows' screen for at least ten minutes, after which it leads me to this black screen with a cursor.

52884,"When someone slowly creeps into your life and they become your top priority in whatever decisions you make or do. 

Even though you know that said person might not even know what they are to you and how much they really mean to you, and that all your intentions may be futile after all.

When you start to think about what you like about them, what made you feel the way you do, and you realise that looks definitely wasn't the main nor the top few reasons. She may or may not be pretty, but she definitely is a diamond in your eyes. 

Is this what blind love feels like? "
52883,"Guys, when you come to NUS and plan to stay in RC, do put rvrc ridge view residential college as your first choice!- its highly recommended- especially for people who just come out of NS. They penalize demerit points (3 for each offense) for leaving 2 shoes outside your room (instead of 1), not switching off your lights when you leave your room, for bringing your male/ female friend to your room for 45 secs, for leaving your things in lounge unattended for 2hrs, for not locking your door (yes, that is a really irresponsible offense) and many more. Along with the natural greenery and natural vistors such as bees, wasps and rare species, it is a perfect place for military outfield like training! I am proud to say- rvrc has evolved to become more disciplined and exciting! I hope that add discipline into their motto next time:) Hope to see yall here! Will be happy to recieve all cadets with a warm salute!"

My problem comes when going for non-biz modules. I know that non-biz mods while class part still holds some weightage, it's not as heavy or at least not as competitive. But the problem is I'm not sure to what extent do I need to speak up and contribute without seeming like a class part slut. Cuz in biz it's expected to speak up once or twice in a lesson. People keep telling me to chill it's not biz, dunnid to be so scared for class part. But at the same time i don't wanna throw away the tutorial participation marks. Advice please."

52863,"I'm bitter. I'm in a course that I have no passion, but no money to go overseas to study what I want. I lost a part of me, lonely and lost. High ses ppl going to trips overseas to Europe and another country in a month break, Australia in recess week.  Friends going out together. Friends disappearing.

But I don't blame them.

Who wants to be friends with someone who has nothing? 
It is hard to be happy when everything smacks you in the face. When you find happiness in something, something comes by and knock you down.

I am the problem.

52844,"I notice alot of people seem to have problems finding teammates for team competitions they want to join. This is especially tedious if you lack the network or can't fill the team with enough friends willing to participate. 

Seems rather unfair how this deprives people of an opportunity to participate in events/competitions (and for me too since I'm pathetic) so I've created a telegram group that can hopefully act as networking platform for everyone.

Just state what competition you're looking to join in the group chat and if anyone is interested, they can get in touch with you on the group or through personal DM.

It is like Thor trying to get back his hammer in the first Thor movie. When he was unworthy, he couldn't budge it even when he touched it. When he became worthy,  it flew toward Thor. 

If you find it unfair that they won't even hang out with you like what they do with their friends,  then you no need them such purpose either.  You can hang out with your friends. 

It is like Thor not needing the Mjolnir to manipulate lightning. "
52834,"Dear NUSSU President,

Why do we have to pay tuition for Industrial Attachment? We shouldn't have to, just like the waived Special Term fees for the Vacation Internship Programme. 

Or, at the very least, give everyone the option to do a VIP instead of an IA. This will also allow more flexibility with regards to modules and second majors / minors.

Please don't censor!
