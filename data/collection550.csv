55098,"Seriously who are the people recording the webcasts?? Becuz quite a lot of my webcasts have no sound, some focused on the prof talking instead of the screen, some zoomed out so much that u cant see what the prof is writing. Can the school do something about this?
Inb4 the ppl commenting ""just go for lectures instead"", i do go for lectures, i just wanna recap what my lecturer said during the lectures bc some lecturers speak quite fast."
55096,"I have an problem now. Have GEH1036 this sat, CS2100 on Tues, CS1231 on following Saturday. Was equally bad on all 3 mods. GEH1036 and CS1231 overlap  like 50%, CS2100 and GEH1036 content like overlap 20%. CS2100 can't SU, while the other 2 can. I have studied GEH1036 to the extent I am considered to be done for CS1231 ... but I don't know good enough to secure A anot, and if I do continue... CS2100 is gonna be bad for me and I cant SU it. 

Should I jump to CS2100 revision and do with a brief GEH1036 on Fri or CS1231+GEH1036 all the way."
55094,#55094 Perhaps you should show your post to the CEG students who complain lecturers and TAs are killing them :P
55092,Some chem and maths modules should provide past year papers with solutions. Not just give the papers without solutions then what’s the point lmao 
55091,"I am frankly quite pissed off with lack of quality teaching in NUS. Profs and TAs even said that we are expected to learn on our own and find out things by ourselves, then what the heck are you there for? It is shocking how most of these lecturers suck and don't have any qualifications for teaching, yet are teaching. Youtube has better videos. I am so pissed that I am paying thousands every year so that I can get certified I am 'smart' enough to complete university and have learn little that I can apply at workplace."
55089,"to #55068, what kind of jobs can you land when you graduate? not trolling, just genuinely curious about the career prospects because I cant decide my specialisation. is it just research and academic jobs? or?"
55088,"To #55083,

I beg to differ. If I'm exempted 40MCs of major modules instead of having some UE exemptions (I'm from ME, exempted 20mc of major mods and 20mc of UEs), I'll most likely suffer.

Poly core modules are a cakewalk compared to undergrad modules. For example, the fluid mechanics/thermodynamics that I learnt in NUS is nothing compared to the fluid mechanics or thermodynamics that I learnt in poly. 

However, I agree that having all these UEs exempted kind of limits my flexibility to take up a minor or modules that I'm interested in. "
55087,"Just curious, how is NUS med like? Is there more test and exams or papers to write? Interested in studying it. What are the criterias that make a canididate stand out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! (:"
55084,Is an IC or an S/U preferable? My sister is down with pneumonia and was recently shifted into the ICU. I'm really stressed and depressed and I don't really know what to do.

I changed some details in that story so I am very sure I am not the person you think I am. I saw your earlier reply, but I didn't want to burst your bubble. Still, I hope you find closure and meaning to your encounter with that guy. Best if you talk to him directly instead of wishing he reads your post and realise it is you - that is not going to happen lady. I wish you the best of luck. "

55071,"For as long as I know my Best Friend (3 years) whenever I asked him if he was interested in anyone, he would always say no. But recently, he say he is interested in someone. I am quite encouraging and ask him to chase after her. I keep asking him to send her a message, ask her out for dinner but he is not very receptive. He always say he will do something tomorrow. But one day, he told me that if he really got a girlfriend, he would have less time for me and asked if that was really what I wished for. Currently, we are living in hall and hang out with each other every day. It kinda feels like a routine you know? I feel that I will miss him but he deserve happiness. Hence, there is this conflicting feeling. Moreover, he asked me many weird questions recently as if he is trying to make me confess to him the feels (may be just me). Some questions he asked include why do you choose to talk to me over other guys in our OG? Have you ever liked me? Why do you choose to hang out with me?

He was always there to listen to me, entertain me and was a really nice friend. I know it is finals and I should be studying but I can't get his questions out of my head. Do I really like him? honestly, IDK. 

I don't have butterflies when I see him. I don't dress up especially nicely just to meet him. But he is always there as my listening ear, seen me in my worst and best state, probably the person I am most comfortable with, knowing all my secrets. 

I have never consider him more than a friend despite all those ""shipping"" from others because I believe that they are just too free. But when he asked me if I ever like him and if I will ever like him, I really DK. Technically it is meaningless if I like him or not as there is already someone else he is interested in and Idk what is wrong with him, asking me about all these at this point in time.

I will be going for NOC next semester and maybe it will do me good. But guys, what do you think I should do?"

55065,"The final exam for GER is in 2 days and I just can’t help but to feel so discouraged. I don’t have a natural flair with things concerning math / technical things in general. I’m so aware of this that I put in extra hard work for GER, but it just doesn’t seem to pay off. I do my work consistently and watch every online lecture at least 2 times. Yet, when I attempted the GER practice paper yesterday, the questions that I could answer correctly was less than half. What’s even more depressing is that I’m hearing that the bell curve for GER is very high. Guess I don’t even stand a chance.."

55063,"I’m the poster of #55982 and #55063 condemning girls having fwb. I’m disappointed with the comments yet again (albeit some are reasonable points and I’m addressing them below). Please don’t comment if you don’t have a point to make and all you do is name calling and giving sinister remarks (eg. One post just comment “TLDR”. Seriously? What an useful comment, trying to attract attention?) I’m here to advise girls on self love, moral value and chastity. There’s an urgent need to fix our tattered moral fabrics. 

Sorry I’m gonna ignore all the useless comments and address a few key issues that surfaced:

1. Stop mentioning about causing harm! John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism and principle of harm is an absurd moral framework don’t you see it? Let me enlighten you: eg. Let’s say cheating with another man when you are married is morally wrong (if you don’t even agree with this, then you are really morally incorrigible). However, what if you are so good at cheating such that your husband can never find out? According to your harm principle logic, the act will miraculously become moral because there will only be harm if you get found out (eg. Husband feel hurt, parents feel disappointed etc). Basically, it is echoing “you can cheat as long as you don’t get caught”. It’s so superficial and absurd. Furthermore, I’m not even using utilitarian framework, why do you insist that you only ascribe to utilitarianism and ask me for harm mechanism?

2. Consequentialism is also a ridiculous framework (for goodness sake, please wiki on it if you don’t know prior to commenting, if not you will just look shallow). Why? For example, you are married and has sex with another man because he drugged you. If based on consequentialism, you are no different from a cheater because the final outcome is that you had sex with another man when you are married. It’s so absurd!! The framework failed to account for intention, ie. Good intention that lead to bad (due to bad luck etc) outcome will be deemed bad. 

3. Postmodern ethic is even more absurd. It adopts moral relativism and everything depends on context and culture. At its bare foundation, it’s basically power, linguistic game intertwined with cowardice to take a stand on moral issues. Basically, everything become subjective and opinion. Seriously? 

Some people may not grasp what I mean, I’ll elaborate a bit more clearly. Tom like strawberry ice cream and Daniel like chocolate ice cream. These are called OPINION and PREFERENCES. Postmodern ethic is basically attempting to change all rights and wrongs into subjective opinion and preferences just like how Tom can’t say Daniel is right or wrong to like chocolate ice cream (eg. Fwb is personal preference. It’s subjective whether casual sex is wrong.) Whether extramarital affair and incest is right or wrong will also become merely preference and subjective opinion. 

Can you imagine how dangerous and chaotic the world will become if everything is subjective? There will be no objective right or wrong or truth. Everybody can disagree on everything and nobody will be right or wrong because there’s no judge or benchmark. Is that what you want when you encourage people not to be judgy? Refusal to stand up against wrong vices such as fwb, and sugarcoat it into personal preference and opinion so that you won’t offend anyone is a classic example of cowardance. The society is getting too fixated on criticising judgy behavior to the point that principles and values are eroding. 

Do you all see the problem? Morality cannot be subjective and change based on context, time, or culture. If you think it will, then you have not truly grasp what morality is because you are merely talking about social norm and socially acceptability. Morality is so different from social norm for goodness sake. 

So what’s the fundamental philosophical issue here? Ans: there needs to be some form of moral GROUNDING and anchor in order to have objectivity. Virtue ethic is the grounding and anchor for human flourishing. Some comments questioned why virtue ethic is the best? Why these virtue and not others etc.. The key is: you cannot question why!! Why not? Ans: because it is the fundamental axiom. What is an axiom? Axiom is an irreducible primary. It doesn't rest upon anything in order to be valid, and it cannot be proven by any ""more basic"" premises. 

We need axiom because if not, we will run into the infinite regress problem. Eg. What is human made of - cell. What is cell made of - atoms. What is atoms made of - proton, neutron and electrons. What is proton made of - quark. What is quark made of - dark matter. What is dark matter made of? Do you see the problem? You can ask “what” infinitely and it will never end. That means there must be some irreducible primary that cannot be questioned even further and that is axiom. 

Examples of axiom are: Parallel lines can never meet. Probability can only range from 0-1. Do you question them? You don’t!! Because they are self evident and are irreducible primary!! It will be insane if you say to your math teacher these are dogma!! 

Virtue is similar to “parallel lines dont intersect and probability range from 0-1”. It is an irreducible primary axiom of moral philosophy that is self evident and cannot be questioned, but it is NOT a dogma. You cannot question the cardinal virtues because they are inherent good, ie. the essence is good and you can’t doubt that the essence of virtue is bad. You can resort to intellectual dishonesty or play verbal games by twisting virtue into bad things (eg. coining terms such as “fwb virtue” or “wisdom of murder”), that will just make you look childish. 

All right... this is not a philosophy classroom and I don’t want to bombard layman with things they can’t grasp, it will just bore them out. 

I just wanna say, I am currently attached for 2 years and neither me nor my gf have any tainted fwb history (hence I’m certainly not an incel nor some desperate horny guy). In fact, I broke up with a girl before she wanna have sex with me before marriage. 

I’m amused that a lot people are annoyed by my superior and holier-than-thou attitude. Because you know what? I don’t even see myself as superior or holier. I’m just a normal person. The fact that you feel I’m holier is because your reference point of “moral normality” is so low such that you feel I’m holier. 

Girls... please stop lowering the moral benchmark even more. If not, nude women walking on street might be the new “morality” in future. Don’t be used by men, please! "

How long more will I need to see significant muscle gains?

But what if we really do end up having sex in that trip, am I obligated to tell my parents (should they probe and ask?) that we actually did end up having sex and have them worry and probably judge me? Or just keep mum about it and distract them by talking endlessly about the other aspects of the trip instead."

 And again you’ll see these people coming out of their humourless lives to point fingers at us about other controversies like the orientation camp. They refuse to see reason and truth and love to belittle us.

Are they just being salty?? Or is it because we are a ‘top ranking’ university that they think it’s okay to talk shit about us? Because let’s be honest, if the article was about ITE, no one will be talking shit in case people start bashing them about being elitist.

You can be in control of your emotions and your thoughts! When the trigger of ordering food and replying messages occur, learn to be aware of your emotions and thoughts.

55003,"Hello, I'm genuinely curious so I hope the admins can let this pass.

In quite a few of the group projects I've seen, people seem to insist on conducting face-to-face meetings, but I'm not seeing why there is a need for f2f specifically instead of conducting online meetings such as voice chat. 

It seems that proponents of f2f claim that people can ""work on things much easier"" or something along those lines, but this can also be done in online meetings through Skype or other applications that have screensharing (+ you don't need to literally cram around 1 PC in f2f).

Another reason why some people think f2f is superior is that people are forced to be more attentive during group meetings, but that's not guaranteed either just because you can see the other person's face? Can you really vouch that you're giving your full attention during f2f meetings as well?

Sure, body language, I will agree that f2f can let you see body language easily. Then again if you really need to see body language that much, you can also host video sessions online as well.

I really don't understand why some groups insist on f2f meetings, especially for things such as ""status updates"", or ""compilation"", because unless you're working on a physical product like a prop or something, the meeting will just end up with people sitting around 1 table, and looking at their own screens. How is this different from doing it in your house instead?

You don't waste time travelling and waiting for the inevitable people who are always late. At the very least even if the same person is late for an online meeting, the rest can start first and don't need to crowd around the meeting point wasting time waiting for the last person.
There is less tendency for discussions to go off-topic (I realised this is mainly for JC-era projects but it can still arise if your group can be divided into distinct cliques). Meetings on the weekend that account for lunch are particularly guilty of this.

No, group meetings are not the same as outing with friends so saying that group meetings are an opportunity to hang out with friends is not sound either, that just makes you less likely to focus on the meeting itself!

I hope someone can enlighten me on this because I'm really not seeing any merit for f2f meeting outside of projects that involve physical props, but it seems that this is still the ""default model"" so convincing them that online meetings are better is unlikely to work (at least in the attempts I've tried due to democracy).

In any case, online discussion doesn't just mean connect to Skype and only use a microphone! There are tons of other features such as screensharing which makes it easier to convey what you are trying to say rather than fumbling over words."
