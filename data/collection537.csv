Halfway through the sem, I've lost that energy...I thought I would burn out if I tried to study a lot at once. But now I'm burnt out of the reason to study, the energy I had from the start of the sem is fading..I just want to know if you guys feel this too?"
53797,"I live in an RC and went on exchange last semester. I am year 3 now. So, I am now completing my last semester in RC. I did not get senior retention, so my 2 year stay in the RC will be done this sem. Last week, I received an email to pay a $200 acceptance fee for my stay next semester. If I pay the $200 fee, will I be allowed to stay for the next semester? 

On the OSA Housing website, it is stated that ""Students who are offered a stay for one Academic Year need not re-apply for accommodation in Semester 2"". So, are the RCs bounded by a contract to allow sem 1 students to stay subsequently in sem 2, despite them not getting senior retention?"

53793,"#53672 Thank you for your post, it really reaffirmed my decision in asking my crush out, despite it not ending well. I would say I was in a very similar situation as you, and ended being ghosted and subtly rejected (which I couldn't tell if it was a rejection or that it was a legit reason for quite a long period of time). It was a devastating period of guessing game and constantly picking myself up to try again and ask again. Nevertheless, my crush got attached to someone else after a few semesters of guessing game. While I was sad, it was a relief that the torturous guessing games can finally cease.

Therefore, I would like to add a clause that asking should not come with an expectation of a reply. It might be a bold step to ask - and I do still fervently believe in that, regardless of what I have been through - but that doesn't guarantee you a direct reply and you shouldn't use that to encourage you to be bold and ask. In other words, don't be encouraged by the fact that you can open Schrodinger's box once you ask. Only ask when you are sure you want to start a relationship with this person, and put all thoughts of whether this will lead to awkwardness and whatnot aside. A mature question begets a mature response, and if the other party fails to rise up to the occasion, perhaps you wouldn't need an immature friend like this anyway.

I would also like to encourage you that you should not regret not asking her out at all. Because not being with her is the reason you are now happily attached to your girlfriend. Think of it this way, the opportunity is not something you want to have anyway. If you had gotten into a relationship with her, you could have not gotten along and broken up with her by now. If you regret, are you thinking along the lines of ""the relationship could have been better if I were with her instead?"". Drop that unhealthy thought!"
53792,"Hi all, I am having a dilemma on whether to do honours thesis and need some advice. While I would like to do HT for the experience, my CAP is currently a borderline second upper(4.1X). Given that HT is a hefty 15MC, I am afraid that I may screw it up and graduate with a second lower instead. Taking modules would in a sense be safer cos I get to spread out the risk over 3 modules. Would like to ask what are the chances of getting at least a B+ for HT? EC major here btw. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"
53791,"It really annoys me when people say that the newer universities (SIT/SUTD) are better than NUS/NTU/SMU just because they have a higher employment rate. 

The newer schools have higher employment rates because the courses they offer are courses that are in demand in today’s society, such as computing, theraphy, info sys etc.

In contrast, NUS/NTU/SMU offer a greater variety of courses. Some of these courses have traditionally lower employment rate, such as the humanities, music or sciences. Obviously as a whole, the more establised schools would then have a lower employment rate.

If we were to compare the more popular course in NUS with SIT, such as accountancy, chem engineering, NUS’s employment numbers are actually higher. NTU’s number are higher than SIT’s as well. Of course SIT have many other courses that trumps us in employment rate but these courses are mostly not in demand in NTU/NUS in the first place whereas in SIT/SUTD, these courses are all that they have.

Also not to mention that NUS/NTU/SMU have way more students. Of course in terms of employment rate they would be disadvantaged.

Some of the people that made statements about how the newer universities are better suggested that this is attributed to the newer unis having a longer internship/attachement period instead of having a more theoretical teaching approach like the established unis. These people of course do not realise that NUS/NTU/SMU offers students the option to have a longer internship period. Anyway, universities, being acadmias, should be about imparting knowledge and developing and interest in the subject matter, rather than mimicking factories and churning out employees.

Anyway pardon my grammar. I wrote this without proof reading."

Looking at pharm sci 20 cores modules, 13 core modules are identical with pharmacy. 

The 7 non identical modules are: 
a) fyp x 2
b) bioinformatics offered by lsm
c) stats for life sci offered by stats
d) pharmaceutical qm 
e) drug product development and lifecycle
f) lab techniques 


Therefore you could say if you studied pharmacy, but decide to read up on (d), (e), (f), intern at a lab, you can actually more or less cover more of what a pharm sci student do. 

The major disadvantage of pharm sci is you cannnot become a registered pharmacist. Only pharmacy course + pre reg grants you the right. 

Pharm sci career will be focused on sales, regulation and development. Of which, once again being a registered pharmacist would have advantage in sales and regulation. 

For sales, if you go to hosp sell drugs, go to gp land to sell to gp, being a pharmacist may be more trustworthy. Not to say ordinary life sci peeps cant sell, they made good drug reps actually. i have met many great life sci sales reps. trust me they are really good. 

For regulation wise, once again being a registered pharmacist will be advantageous, as you knows how the system works and can intepret clinical studies with ease. 

For development wise is where pharm sci peeps will shine, the medicinal chem knowledge of an average pharmacist is dismal. really they can hardly synthesize anything. some times they cant even recall simple pharmacokinetics eqn and calculate simple things like half life. poor maths skills. lab techniques also very mediocre as the course is clinically oriented. i believe the objective of pharm sci is develop a group of graduates with strong scientific skills for the industry. the current pharmacy course is too clinically oriented and may produce graduates not ideal for the industry. there is simply no way to squeeze the both clinical and scientific components into a 4 yrs course. 

so in general, 
a) if you wanna go clinical route and practicing pharmacist, definitely pharmacy.
b)  if you wanna go development and lab work, definitely pharm sci. the internships and training provided are simply better. Free up clinical time for scientific skills.
c) sales and regulation wise, doesnt really matter coz general life sci (dont even need pharm sci) can do as well.

53740,"There are 4 types of inequality and not all of them are remediable. 

1st type-income inequality. If you earn 200k a year, and I earn 30k a year, this is income inequality.

2nd type - wealth inequality. If you born in a wealthy family and inherit millions, while I have to pay the debts of my parents, that is wealth inequality 

3rd type- connections inequality. If your dad knows who and who, and you can get a competitive internship in certain firm which translates to a perm job, while I have problem finding internship, that is connections inequality. 

4th type- iq inequality. If you can recall stuff better, good cognitive skills and have iq of 130 while I’m of average iq of 100, that is inequality.

So how do we address inequality?

1) income tax?
2) capital gains/ inheritance tax?
3) ?? Open bid for jobs?
4) ?? Genetic manipulation?

Just for the 2 group assignments last week we spent a total of 7 hours, with his 3hrs lecture that is 10 hours already, not including the forum posting, the 600 word essay with at least 10 citations, and project 2. And 10 hours is the weekly workload for a 4 MC module wth. Yet he maintains this consistent workload every week.

I feel that not much has been taught and I have not taken away much substance from the module, convince me wrong.
Resubmissions of the same assignment carries a separate penalty for late submissions. Our ideas have to be 'new to the world' and 'radical'. We can try but it seems that this is an avenue to steal ideas from students for future course material.

To those who have yet to take EG2301, DO NOT. In fact, say no to DCP. Having taken some modules from DCP, it seems like a branded programme with limited substance.

I'm not sure how effective changing my Instagram handle will be, given that my name is in my handle and I've removed my account from the place where this all started.

53711,"Dear G,

After all this time (two and a half years) I never thought you would pop up in my life again like today, in the most unplanned way. Were you surprised? I thought you did when I saw that look in your eyes when you looked up at me. I might have treated you with common courtesy and no acknowledgement of our past acquaintance, but little did you know about the emotional turmoil ensued after you left, until now.

Seeing you again I could not help but thinking back about those two years. It's hard not to find those memories bittersweet. The effortless chemistry from the first day I went to our school, all the crazy coincidences, from life goals to school activity choices to food choices and other small things. All those things that made me think that our fate intertwined somehow, and I didn't know you had the same thought until one year later. All the memories that had been left untouched for years; I thought I would never dig them up from the bottom of my brain again. Yet today I was surprised at how much I still remember. But those memories no longer reduced me to tears, now they only filled me with a bittersweet feeling that has no name.

And I'm also aware that there is a reason, or many reasons, why we ended our relationship. Seeing you today, I was surprised at how many things about you I just could not see back then. I won't go into details, not to undermine you, but I felt relieved not having to be in the same situation as the girl you were with today. 

I apologise if I was cold towards you. Unlike the last time we met three months after the break up during A levels result day, we really have had our own ways this time. You and I have lost contact somewhere along those years and with everything we have gone through, individually, we might as well be strangers by now, with the only thing in common being our past connection. But it is not something we can reminisce and talk about when we meet. Why bring the past up when it does nothing but making us sad and may even affect our current relationships? I no longer know how to talk to you, which is why I could not give you anything more than common politeness.

Funny how as I thought about our encounter today, I kept thinking if this had happened much sooner, closer to our break up, I would certainly have jumped to the conclusion that this is a sign from the universe and heaven above that we should get back together. Now, for many accumulative reasons, seeing you is just like hearing an echo from my past. A past that has so little, if not nothing, to do with my life nowadays. You're probably wondering why I spent so much time writing all this. I know you, like most of our schoolmates, read this page and deny about it irl. I can not carry these thoughts and feelings with me right now, so I have to get it out of my system some way.

Thank you readers if you're still with me until now. What other thoughts do you have upon seeing a (long-lost) ex? (:
