55799,"I thought that the interview went well.

The interviewer asked me if any company invited me for a 2nd round of interview. 

I thought that the interviewer felt that I was a good candidate and wanted to know if they had any competitors so that they would have to haste their decision making process

However, I wasn't invited for a 2nd round even after 2 weeks. I check my call log, SMS, and email multiple times to ensure that I didn't miss out on anything.

Did I misinterpret the sign?"
55798,"Hello, I am a Y2 student trying to decide whether to major in Psychology. I think that the theories-based mods that I have taken so far (E.g PL3236) are manageable. However, I am kind of apprehensive about the prospect of taking stats mods like PL2132 since I didn't do too well in PL2131. Is it advisable to major in Psych even if I am not very confident about my aptitude for stats and SPPS?

I would really appreciate some advice. THANK YOU!"

Let's admit it. Maybe I am not clear in my previous post. I did not try to categorize passion and money to be mutually exclusive. In fact, if you found something that has passion and is accompanied by high salary, I will definitely be happy for you! What i am referring is if you are in a point where you got to choose a route with either passion with low salary or a route with no passion with high salary, my advice to you is to choose the route - ""No passion with high salary"". Better to be upset with cash rather than upset with no cash.  Eh, must think far la...This is Singapore okie! Next time when you grow older and IF you decide to start a family, you need to buy house, buy pamper, buy milk, buy food, give your parents money, child expenditures...etc. All of this need money. How much can your ""high passion with no money"" able to support all of this ??? Even if you decide to stay super frugal, after deducting CPF, how much will your disposable income left? At that point, you will constantly be looking towards payday everyday. Of course, there are few people who choose with ""High passion with low salary"", either you decided to stay single forever or you come from a rich family. I am in my mid 30s and just wants to share my opinions. To those people who thinks that being money-focused is a bad thing, bored or narrow-minded, I agree to you that it is stressful and worrying. But let me tell you...you are saying all these now because you are currently studying and not paying for all the expenses. Who is paying for your electricity bills, water bills, internet bills, home and your food? It is your parents right? You do not even need to worry on ""where to stay"" because it is provided by your hardworking parents who are money-focused to give you a better and easy non-money focused life. If you were to finance for your own stay, market rental rate is approximately $600 already for a hdb room. Total cost of living minimum at $1k. If let's say that you are to survive on your own, will you still think that ""Aiya , money is nothing la... "". Talk is cheap. True?

I can't help but rather find it amuse by someone who can really rant at my post. You are a university student but the way you write and think sound like a kid to me. First, what do i gain from writing? Nothing. Why so upset about it? There are so many important things to do in life. Why will you even need to condemn yourself to rant on someone post. And when you want to debate or to share your views, try not to add insulting words to it. What is the point of adding ""extrinsically motivated ass"" in your views? This statement is so ""try hard"" to insult me. If you can be easily upset over a wall of text, life will be difficult to you in future. Debate and share your views amicably. And don't think too highly on yourselves that ""Singaporeans never fail to disgust me and let me down time and time again"". Who are you to think that Singapore let you down time and time? LOL. Everyone is nobody in this world.  If you really think that you are somebody, comment it below so I will show you my ""extrinsically motivated ass"" to you. Else, Stay humble and be kind to others.

It's bugging me even more since she's very cautious and insists on protection with me.

I don't usually ask about sexual history, but it came up during a checkup and I don't know how to deal with it.

55772,"I normally don’t say much here but the recent posts discrediting the value of a FASS degree prompted me to say something. To give some context, I am a sociology major who's graduating soon, which some may consider as even more “useless” than majors such as econs and pol science. Considering I will be finding a job soon, the issue definitely speaks to me.

FASS in a nutshell encourages its students to constantly question and find out more about the human world, which is always useful considering we live in one. In sociology, we learn that almost every aspect of our lives are shaped by human intentions, interactions and social structures and organisations. Social interaction can be seen as the foundation of society. Even before we convey and share ideas with people, we observe particular etiquette and norms when interacting with others. There has to be a particular mechanism at work that promotes stability in social life, allowing us to cooperate and collaborate instead of us seeing each other as threats, kicking in our survival instinct. But who defines these norms?

Using medicine as an example since it was mentioned in another post about its usefulness. We don’t deny that. But what goes into defining a particular sickness? Of course we look at the different symptoms. But going deeper, we see that even definitions itself is agreed upon by a group of people (doctors), making it socially constructed. So we question further; who are these experts? People in power? Where does this power come from? Who are the people who sanction and fund these efforts and what are their intentions? This goes for other dimensions of social life too. What is defined as success? So going by the capitalist society and definition, it is material aspects and productive value. We can go one step further. In light of our capitalist society, so what is the true purpose of curing someone who is sick? Is it really for our own well being? A more critical Marxist may see it as an attempt to cure an individual merely so that they can rejoin the capitalist workforce and continue producing.

These questions cannot be taken lightly. Each individual, while a member of society, could have their own agendas and beliefs while simultaneously being exposed to society’s general values as well. The Singapore government only recognises heterosexual families and allocates benefits to them. So how does this affect those in a same sex relationship? Is this stance truly because of our society’s supposed conservative and religious values or is it giving value to the ability of heterosexual couples to have children, which in turn will help the government to ensure continued availability of our workforce for our economy in future? Those who are in support of our society being more inclusive will say it is a human right. Again, we question. What makes someone human? What is human nature? Does everyone truly deserve the same rights? Is sacrificing social stability in the name of upholding human rights justified? Examples are littered throughout history about what happens to society when an extreme ideology takes hold.

FASS students strive to find out the actual motivations and reasons for what we take for granted. You’ll be surprised how many people take a lot of aspects in our daily life at the surface. Our majors provide the rigour by constantly encouraging us to consider different perspectives. There is no one model “answer” to all our social problems. It is a constant balancing act. I may hold a particular view but others may see it in a different light. This is where discussions really help, seeing the strengths and weaknesses of each argument. Studying arts and humanities alone in your free time will not grant you this opportunity. FASS is essentially a study about humans and the different aspects of our lives, be it through the lens of linguistics, history, psychology and others. We see how small entities can actually have a great impact on how we live our lives.

Am I worried about my job prospects? I do think there are people, like myself, who are definitely apprehensive. But personally, I would still choose to major in sociology if given the chance to change my choices. Because I have learnt so much not only about society and life, but also myself. It gives me perspective on what I truly treasure in life. I’m more of an easy-going person so I believe things will fall into place and I will eventually find my place in society. I do acknowledge that some people may not hold the same mindset.

Perhaps the reason why FASS graduates are unemployed is not because we don’t have any skills, but more of being unable to find jobs that align with our values. This is of course the ‘ideal’. We have seen how capitalism has indeed brought about progress, but at a number of costs, like our environment, marginalisation and our personal wellbeing. Unfortunately, we do still need money to survive. So we may be forced to conform and just be another cog in the system.

The other option is of course to strike out on our own. There is no one true path to success and an answer to how one should live life. Besides, it’s about how you can utilise the skills and knowledge you have gained in uni. You can choose to be a spoke in the wheel or you can break the wheel :)

The point is you need to know what you want rather than expecting your degree to lead the way. If you are entering FASS expecting to be hired as a data analyst/software developer then I guess that's just pure stupidity. A FASS degree is no handicap in the corporate world at an exec level, many companies are willing to hire generalists as long as you have the necessary skills. By skills I don't mean ""communication"" (bragging) skills but real skills like proving you can events plan, you can coordinate, you can f*-ing do paper work. You need to be really good at at least one thing. 

Now the question is really how? Get an internship that will build your skills + resume, internships that allow you to handle a project, etc. Have some work experience to talk about when you land yourself a job interview. Do yourself (& your recruiter) a big favour by talking about something outside of your school or even cca (for god's sake). Prove that you are ready for the corporate world and oh, don't rely on the school to find you jobs. Work your own ass and start you job hunt process early. 

As an encouragement to all FASS students, there are companies like mine willing to hire students from all FASS disciplines. My co-workers are from Georg, Psych, Econs,... You name it and we have it! Just learn to market yourself and not your degree! That's equivalent to saying ""oh i graduate from pol sci i will make a good prime minister"". Lastly, whatever you do, get a good honours.

55732,"#55709: As a biz student, I don't agree to that at all. There's some things about business just as useless as an arts degree and some things definitely more useful.

First of all, for all this talk on degrees, can we please just stop generalizing degrees? Especially an arts degree? Or a biz degree for that matter? There's many different components you can choose to specialise in and it depends on WHICH you specialise in.

A business degree for example, is just plain common sense if you take say, marketing or HR. 
'Pay employees more to retain them better'. Wow, mind-blowing. Who knew. 

'Good branding makes better sales.' Now go memorize the entire definition of what a brand is and all these irrelevant marketing terms.

You could literally chuck some coffee shop uncle in a HR/marketing job and he can do the job the same. Maybe not as efficiently but still the same work. 
These job areas require more EQ than IQ, which I guess... is equally important anyway...and girls love this for some reason.

Meanwhile specialisations like accounting, biz analytics, and finance are very technical and require heads-on knowledge that isn't general at all. As a biz student, it's an insult whenever I hear them say business is general knowledge. It's really not, if you plan to go in the banking sector or something. The stuff you learn is really not easy and straightforward. 

For arts, there's also different usefulness depending on what major you take. 
If you take something like philosophy, I gotta agree, it's enlightening but kinda useless. Maybe you can become a lecturer or write books no one reads then contemplate so much on the meaning of life, mind body and soul, then you end up falling into a deep depression...

But if you take others like political science or economics, you can certainly contribute in the government sector as an analyst or something. 

It really depends on what you major in, the knowledge you gain may be useful or not...applicable or not."

55725,"Am an engineering student that likes to make fun of FASS employment prospects, but to be completely honest, I think FASS is the best option for anybody who has the drive and passion to pursue the arts and humanities.  

The entire question is predicated on the myth that employment for FASS students is much lower than other courses - let me be clear, there is absolutely no truth in that statement - there are similar employment rates for students across different faculties (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/graduate-employment-survey-ntu-nus-sit-smu-sutd), and although there may be differences in starting pay and career progression, I'd argue that that's not the point of a degree. The sort of thinking that you should always choose the route that's the most 'practical' (which, lets be honest, is just a Singaporean euphemism in place of the word 'material') is the same sort of idiocy that breeds people who love their careers but hate their work - the type of person who lives for their weekends but finds no passion or drive in their daily 9 to 5 other than their next paycheck or promotion.

There's also been arguments that the arts can be pursued as a hobby instead of a degree, which I find utterly ridiculous. Trust me, if you think you can pursue any FASS discipline as a hobby and achieve any rigor approaching an academic level, you're probably so deep into the Dunning-Kruger effect that you've not even scratched the surface of the subject you're talking about, like people who claim to have quantum physics after watching a bad Discovery documentary."

55718,"#55679 It's not a finals only mod, but the cohort size is small and the prof has pretty much mentioned that there will always be people retaking it :/… It's a 2k mod, I'm not sure if I can SU it.

Didn't think I'd be one of the people retaking it though :'-)

I don't get how people who barely put in any effort and do the bare minimum like simply showing up for lecture and tutorial can do well enough to get a B? I do that and go beyond that to do practice questions, spending most of my time studying with my friends but we never seem to do well? These smart people sometimes don't even show up on time for lectures, and even if they're early all they do is chill in the LT, and then leave as soon as the lecture is over. 

It's not fair to us at the bottom that smart people push up the bell curve so it's harder to score a B, is it? I don't think they even put in half as much effort as we do.

"
55715,"How does one know whether a mod is being bell-curved or not?

Someone told me CS2030 is not bell-curved, obviously I can't get 80% so does that mean A is gone?"
55714,"There are no useful or useless degrees, only useful or useless people.. 

Remember, every degree is a good degree."
55713,"#55713 I stayed in PGP for the whole 4 years of my bachelor. Don't worry, it is safe. You have to tap card to enter the lift, tap card to press lift buttons, and then tap card to enter your cluster gate. Three layers of security before you reach your room. Plus cameras everywhere.
I wouldn't say PGP is the cleanest but definitely reasonably clean. Rooms are fully furnished. More quiet as compared to halls, where there are lots of CCAs and activities happening. And it is a bus terminal, which means you will be one of the first to board and will likely get a seat. Busses are extremely crowded esp. at the beginning of the semester and during exam time. Plus, if it is terminal, you don't need to worry about missing the stop."

It is not even faculty-level, what you described is department level. Whatever floats ECE's boat."
55710,"to #55700, travelling alone isn’t something bad, in fact it’s really enjoyable!!!!☺️ I do understand the joy of having company, but having time just for yourselves, esp overseas/ places you really love, it’s such a cherishable moment ???????? Dont worry at all! :) I’m with you."
55709,"#55709: As a biz student, I don't agree to that at all. There's some things about business just as useless as an arts degree and some things definitely more useful.

First of all, for all this talk on degrees, can we please just stop generalizing degrees? Especially an arts degree? Or a biz degree for that matter? There's many different components you can choose to specialise in and it depends on WHICH you specialise in.

A business degree for example, is just plain common sense if you take say, marketing or HR. 
'Pay employees more to retain them better'. Wow, mind-blowing. Who knew. 

'Good branding makes better sales.' Now go memorize the entire definition of what a brand is and all these irrelevant marketing terms.

You could literally chuck some coffee shop uncle in a HR/marketing job and he can do the job the same. Maybe not as efficiently but still the same work. 
These job areas require more EQ than IQ, which I guess... is equally important anyway...and girls love this for some reason.

Meanwhile specialisations like accounting, biz analytics, and finance are very technical and require heads-on knowledge that isn't general at all. As a biz student, it's an insult whenever I hear them say business is general knowledge. It's really not, if you plan to go in the banking sector or something. The stuff you learn is really not easy and straightforward. 

For arts, there's also different usefulness depending on what major you take. 
If you take something like philosophy, I gotta agree, it's enlightening but kinda useless. Maybe you can become a lecturer or write books no one reads then contemplate so much on the meaning of life, mind body and soul, then you end up falling into a deep depression...

But if you take others like political science or economics, you can certainly contribute in the government sector as an analyst or something. 

It really depends on what you major in, the knowledge you gain may be useful or not...applicable or not."
55707,"Hi chem eng ppl (graduate or undergraduate), can you share more about the prospects of a chemical engineering degree?"
55706,"Hi NUS peeps!

I wanna ask if there is a way where we can double-check how many more modules (& the type of modules) that we need to take in order to graduate? I did my own recording of modules but I just want to be 100% sure..."
55705,"Studied Japanese studies.

Got hired by Japanese MNC. 

Starting pay 4k. 

No hard skills. 

Arigato."
55704,"With all this debate about what is a useful or useless degree... I really think we need to think about what is the purpose of a University. Is it a factory to produce employable adults? Or is it to discover and impart knowledge? I would argue for the latter. Universities have traditionally been centres of knowledge. They guide the way we think, teach us how to learn and equip us with skills that are difficult to acquire in other contexts. Only in recent decades did people attend universities to improve their career prospects. Certain industries definitely require a professional degree (e.g. law, medicine or even engineering).  Your soft skills aren't going to help you perform surgery so please don't say a degree is not important. Lastly, how much you get out of uni really depends on what you do during your university days. So go out and make the most out of your time in NUS!"
55702,"Apart from IVLE, is there any other way to check the weightage of a module's components? Because a lot of the modules in my major do not have the % available on IVLE, and I'm planning to choose the mods with little to no group work, but it's impossible to do that without knowing the components beforehand. I've also tried to Google for mod reviews but there aren't any. "

Recently, i just got to know that this girl is interested in me and i really dont mind getting to know her better and even dating her. She's a really nice girl. (im also talking to a few guys currently.) She has been initiating a few meet ups and im really cool with it. But im just worried that i might fall back into the gay circle while dating her. i dont want this to happen and i dont want to hurt her in the future. this may sound pretty effed up but im just very lost at this point and idk what to do. i need some advice or better if anyone had been in the same situation pls give me some advice....."
