I am in a similar position, my family earns less than $2-3k every month and I work every month even during school term to earn some pocket money for myself. I am also graduating this semester and will be going on a grad trip with my friends. 

At first, I was thinking, should I not go overseas and save the money for my family instead? Since, like many in the comment section had said:
1) Family first
2) Family will be there for you more than your friends

However, the friends I'm going with are friends that I've known for a long time, and I know that once everybody start working, have boyfriends, or even will start to plan to have a family, it will be difficult to plan for an overseas trip in the future. I also treat it as a motivation, for me to clear my mind, and to be ready to work hard in my future career, to focus 100% on my family, clear their debts and etc. 

Finances wise, since we planned early, we tried to find the lowest cost flights and airbnb, and during trip planning, we tried to go as budget as possible (e.g. going to an area and touring that area for the day, to save on transport; checking out discount sites like klook, or even going to the tourism board of the country that we are going to to see if they have discount coupons to spare). And set a limit on how much we can spend by changing $x and sticking to that amount on the trip. Even though I'm not going to Japan, I believe that it is possible to enjoy while going on budget as well - take many pictures!

I guess this is also a time to test your friendships? To see if both parties are willing to compromise. If they are willing to give up going to expensive places, or if you are willing to splurge just once/twice as a treat for yourself?

We have never travelled as a family together, but I always make sure to bring back some souvenirs, such as items like shirts and food for my family. And make it a point that when I start working, I need to bring them out. I know I may be called selfish for not putting my family first, but who knows, this time after grad and before work may be the only time that we are really ""free"" and the only time for us to properly relax before stepping into the workforce."
62871,"#62871: I feel you, losing weight can be really tough. I went on a long, healthy, and successful weight loss programme and here are some tips.

First of all, some commenters say that 1200kcals will malnourish you and that is not really true. As a girl in your early 20's your basal metabolism is probably around 1200-1300kcals, so keeping it around 1200 is fine. But I wouldn’t suggest calorie counting; a rough idea of how much you’re eating is less stressful. 

What matters more is what you eat. I'm sorry to break it to you but the food you get from coffee shops is not the best for losing weight. Not even the 'healthier' options. Contrary to what the posters say, fish soup or YTF is not really a good option because of the sheer amount of sodium in them. Sodium is worse than carbs because they make you bloated, which makes one look 'fat' too. Also, it’s okay if you eat carbs - if you reduce carbs too much you’ll have crazy cravings. Just opt for the better carbs. Take brown rice instead of white rice and avoid flour - that includes noodles, dumplings, etc. Tbh it’s really hard to get food in Singapore that helps you to lose weight, even the veggies in economic rice are cooked in oil. Don’t get me wrong, the food is quite healthy for people who are trying to maintain their weight, but not for those who are trying to lose weight. 

You can also try to cook during the summer break, have fresh veggies, proteins, and healthier carbs. And try not to eat anything after dinner and drink lots of water (~2L a day).
 
Oh and here’s a tip - you should actually say goodbye to stuff like sweets and fried food (I know, sad), but you should allow yourself to eat a bit once a week or so, to control your cravings. Set a day aside (like Sunday) to eat what you want (in moderation). This helped me a lot. 

If you happen to break down one day and eat supper or something, don’t give up. Eat slightly cleaner the next day and don’t give up. Sometimes you’ll find yourself breaking down for days on end… still, don’t give up. I’ve been there. It will get worse during your period and it will be very difficult to lose weight during that week. But the important thing is to persevere. Weight loss is a repetition of stagnant weight and sudden loss, so sometimes you need to wait a bit until your numbers start going down.

For cardio, running is better than walking. Honestly, brisk walks don’t really help with weight loss, I’ve tried. :( You can run a bit and then walk fast, then run again, and so on. 

Now, weights. So, you see some people who tell you to ‘get a trainer’ or ‘do weights’, right? I agree to half of that. In the long run, yes, you need muscles to get into a better shape. If you keep doing only cardio, you’ll be really skinny but not in a healthy, good-looking way. So in the long run, you need muscles, and you need to do weights to gain muscle mass.

But, here’s the thing. Weight loss is all about the mentality and stress. Especially when your weight is affecting you psychologically. I was in your shoes too. When you’re at the early stages of losing weight, seeing the numbers change is really helpful. So at first, focus on really changing your eating habits and doing cardio, so you start seeing changes in your weight. Also, take photos in the mirror and see those changes yourself. After you’ve lost a few pounds you can start weights. Yes, the initial weight loss is mostly losing some water and a bit of muscle mass. But that does motivate you initially.

Secondly, it’s much harder for girls to gain muscles. You can do squats, lunges, and crunches every single day and not gain a lot of muscle mass. The muscle-gaining process will be a long, long journey. If you start weights too early, you’ll get stressed because you won’t see much weight loss but you don’t see muscles either. It’s all about stress control.

And last but not least - give yourself a lot of time. Weight loss that happens in a short period of time will lead to a quick regain. Give yourself at least a few months and think of it as a process to change your lifestyle and habits! It’s really self-care because you are getting yourself to eat healthier food and adopt healthier habits (like exercise regularly, sleep early, drink more water). It will take some time because losing weight doesn’t have a one-size-fits-all method. You’ll need to take a lot of trial and error to find a way that works for you. All the best!"
62870,"How much contact should I keep with my parents when I'm in uni?

20M, I'll be entering Yale-NUS College in 3 months, where I'll be staying on campus for 4 years. I don't really like my parents, and I'd prefer to cut all contact with them completely if possible.

Problem is, we live in a pretty big house, and for long time I've always helped with cleaning the house every weekend. If I'm gone, then my parents would have to deal with it themselves, and imo it's kinda a dick move. So I'm wondering if I should bother coming back every Sunday just to mop the floor and then fuck off.

I'm just worried about how that would reflect on me. I'm a pretty independent person and I don't want people to think I'm homesick or something. Remember back in NS, nobody liked the crybaby recruit who keeps calling his parents every night, ya? Plus, getting home from my uni can take more than 1 and a half hours, and I'm not sure if I want to waste all that time that could be spent studying, socialising, or getting enough sleep.

Or I could delegate it all to my 15 yo sister. But she's taking her O levels next year so it wouldn't be nice to dump all the household duties on her. Plus, her track record with doing housework hasn't been great, so chances are my parents would end up tanking everything anyways.

So yeah, what's your experience with this, and how involved should I be with my family?"

62866,"I feel awkward every time when friends ask me for my grades. The best case is that we get the same grade, which is very unlikely. Otherwise, I don't know how I should respond when their grade is higher than mine, should I congratulate them? And when my grade is higher, should I pretend that I feel pity for them? I know some ask due to their competitive trait, but some just want to validate themselves. Regardless of the intention, is there any way that I can hide my grade without offending them?

62859,"Hi OP of #62801, this might sound very cliche but really, the only way to get over someone is allowing yourself time to do so.

Last year I got close to this guy I met through friends. We shared common interests and I used that as an excuse to ask him out. 

We would often hang out. He would lend me a listening ear whenever I need one and a shoulder to cry on when I feel down.

He even offered to piggyback me when I suddenly hurt my leg. I always thought that meant he likes me. 

Feeling hopeful, I began to ask him out more and more. However, he started keeping a distance from me. 

I took that as rejection and stopped contacting him. I played it cool but deep down I felt really hurt. 

I couldn't stop thinking about us and it upsets me whenever I see him hanging out with other people. 

I tried to find a part-time job to keep myself busy. I also went out with friends whenever I'm free. It did make me feel better, although only temporarily. 

Many nights I would recall the times we spent together. Time really heals though. My memory of us slowly faded as time passed. 

One day I bumped into him at a mutual friend's party. He offered to send me home. 

Before he left, he asked me if we could hang out again. He confessed that he liked me but didn't want to lead me on because he had a LDR back then. They had a mutual break up awhile after I stopped contacting him. 

Surprisingly I didn't feel happy when he confessed. I only felt a sense of pity because we met at the wrong time. It was then I realised I have finally gotten over him. I confessed to him that I liked him too but I have moved on.

Heartbreaks are like physical wounds. They take time to heal. You gotta wait patiently for it to heal. Sad but true.

62858,"...I think a vast majority of my coursemates are toxic af. 

I get that y'all are happy that you did well for exams, but that doesn't give you an excuse to go up to the people who didn't and rub your  glee in their faces. Who the hell sneers and cackles at people for failing to finish a paper?  Who the hell tells clearly stressed-out and anxious people they anticipate watching them break down? It's insensitive, sadistic and completely uncalled for. Yet, here, such sociopathy and amorality appears to be the ""norm"". 

This is the problem when you congregate too many ""straight A"" people into one course. The elitism just shoots through the roof, while human decency plummets straight to the seventh circle of hell. 

Or maybe, it's just the bell curve pitting us all against each other.

62856,"My bf recently broke up with me, saying that he no longer feels the same for me as I am too dependent on him. He told me that I have to be happy with myself in order for a relationship to be successful and that I’m a toxic person. I’ve googled signs that I’m the toxic one in our relationship and came to realise that I was actually toxic. Thing is he doesn’t at all think he is at fault as though he lost his memory or some sort. Throughout our three years relationship, he has been pressuring me to have sex with him all the time whenever he makes an effort to pick me from my home, and there was never once I rejected because I couldn’t bear to see him sad. As it was a LDR, I felt like I’ve been used for sex but didn’t really express how I felt because I was so afraid he would leave me which was a wrong choice I’ve made, he left me eventually. I guess I am never ready to be in a relationship then as I doubt I can be happy with myself, ever."

62852,"Hello #62810, I'm #62719. 

You asked, ""how did you decide to leave your previous relationships and what made your current one different?""

Sometimes you meet the right person but at the wrong time. I guess my current one is the right one who appeared at the right time.

I started dating my first ex when we were both 18. We shared many common interests, which got us closer. 

However, as we got closer, I started to see how different we are. These differences often led to arguments. 

I got tired of the endless quarrelling. I felt like we are very different people and I didn't know how to resolve the issues we faced as I didn't know how to communicate well.

Maybe I thought I could find someone who would suit me better. And when this someone appeared, I felt that it was time to leave the rs. 

My second ex was a very sweet, kind and caring guy. We would spend almost every day together and prioritise our rs above everything else.

Along the way, we lost ourselves. We were trapped in our own tiny bubble. We neglected our own social circle and personal life. 

Initially this tiny bubble felt very much like a comfort zone you don't want to get out of. But eventually it felt rather suffocating.

One day you realise you don't know who you are anymore. You are probably just somebody's girlfriend. And suddenly you feel like maybe you want a guy who actually has a life of his own. And when that guy came along, I knew this rs has to end. 

Third ex - smart, funny, sociable, outgoing. All these came at a price. He has alot of female friends, many of whom happen to be quite pretty. He would hang out with them pretty often. 

I felt quite insecure whenever he goes out with these friends. I knew I wasn't confident of myself. I felt his friends are more fun and better looking than me.

I got tired of feeling insecure all the time. And when I met someone who seems like the more serious type of guy, I decided to end my rs. 

This serious guy is my current one and hopefully my last one. lol.

How is he different? Like what I said before, he's a pretty average guy and the only not so average thing about him is his love for me. 

His love is like a burning charcoal. It burns slowly but steadily. Day by day, he tries to learn more and more about me and find ways to show that he cares. Slow and steady wins the race right? 

My first ex taught me the importance of communication. My second ex taught me the importance of independence. My third ex taught me the importance of confidence. My current one taught me love. 

They are all perfect in their own ways. It's just that I met them at different stages of my life. It happens that when I met my current one, I was more ready for a relationship.

You meet different people for a different reason. Just because the relationship ended, it doesn't mean the relationship wasn't real. 

You would always have something to learn from the people you meet. Along the way, you learn to become a better person. And when the time comes, you will be ready to love and meet someone deserving of your love.

62843,"Is it me or do people who go NOC get more annoying and arrogant? I have two friends going NOC next sem, and while they used to be okay people, they've become extremely insufferable after getting that NOC placing.

One of them has a habit of asking around to find out who's going where on SEP, and replies ""oh, you're going there? I'm going NOC silicon valley"" *pause for effect*. It's very obvious that he's fishing for compliments, and when the other person goes ""oh...nice"" he looks damn put out by the response. He then goes on to ramble about all the ~entrepreneurial spirit~ and *industry connections* he's going to get on NOC and asks what the other person will get from their exchange. God help those who say they're not going on exchange.

The other one has a habit of bringing up startups and entrepreneurship into literally every conversation. Like even in a convo about what to have for lunch he'll start talking about new ideas for ""disrupting"" the f&b industry when really all he's disrupting is our discussion. Also he has become extremely shameless about asking CS kids to work with, or rather for him on his many many app ideas for free (he's from Biz). He talks a big game about how we'll all strike it rich if his app idea takes off but knows absolutely nothing about app development.

62837,"Hello #62774, I used to seek treatment for trauma+depression. This reply is mainly about the medication part that you mentioned. 

Do you know what meds she's taking and what their side effects are? From my own experience, it is possible that taking meds or even changing/stopping dosage can cause big changes in energy levels and personality. The patient may also not notice the changes as much as the people around her. 

This is a long shot, but I might as well make the point with my own horror story coming off Paxil. I took 10mg of Paxil per day (half a pill) for 2 months, and it worked initially. The psychiatrist then told me I could stop any time due to the low dosage, and never warned me about any withdrawal symptoms. So I stopped, and had quite strong physical and emotional side effects for two weeks (similar to the stories here: https://seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/the-hell-of-seroxat-withdrawal/). It was only later that I realised how oddly I was behaving to those around me. 

Anyway, it can be serious stuff, and it's good that you are observant and in touch with your person. Maybe you can try to find out more about the medication, and see if there's anything that doesn't add up, or seems dangerous. It's not easy caring for someone without enough knowledge. All the best!"

No matter what happens, don't walk away or give up on the relationship. Give your bf/gf a chance is also giving the relationship a chance to work. Because one day if that person walks out of your life, you are going to regret not giving another chance to him or her. For those who are single, always remember that there is someone out there who is right for you, you just haven't met them yet. But someday in your life, you will meet them. And when you do, you will know that you have met 'the one'."
62813,"To #62813: By giving up, are you referring to giving up on grades or on improving your life in general? I imagine they're quite different things."
62812,Anyone currently driving part time for Grab or Gojek and able to successfully balance with studies? I own a car and I am thinking to be a part time private driver but I don't know is it worth it. I am not financially needy and I am just looking to earning some income to help pay for the car's upkeep and to afford some of the better things in life like travel.
62811,"I got into NUS 10 years ago. Due to family issues affecting me, I went on LOA and even when I’m back, my grades dropped tremendously and was dismissed. I didn’t even try to appeal back then. Now I have a career and am doing fine in life, I still think of going back to sch and complete what I have not completed. I was rejected for full time programmes, will I stand a better chance for part time ones?"
62810,"Hello #62810, I'm #62719. 

You asked, ""how did you decide to leave your previous relationships and what made your current one different?""

Sometimes you meet the right person but at the wrong time. I guess my current one is the right one who appeared at the right time.

I started dating my first ex when we were both 18. We shared many common interests, which got us closer. 

However, as we got closer, I started to see how different we are. These differences often led to arguments. 

I got tired of the endless quarrelling. I felt like we are very different people and I didn't know how to resolve the issues we faced as I didn't know how to communicate well.

Maybe I thought I could find someone who would suit me better. And when this someone appeared, I felt that it was time to leave the rs. 

My second ex was a very sweet, kind and caring guy. We would spend almost every day together and prioritise our rs above everything else.

Along the way, we lost ourselves. We were trapped in our own tiny bubble. We neglected our own social circle and personal life. 

Initially this tiny bubble felt very much like a comfort zone you don't want to get out of. But eventually it felt rather suffocating.

One day you realise you don't know who you are anymore. You are probably just somebody's girlfriend. And suddenly you feel like maybe you want a guy who actually has a life of his own. And when that guy came along, I knew this rs has to end. 

Third ex - smart, funny, sociable, outgoing. All these came at a price. He has alot of female friends, many of whom happen to be quite pretty. He would hang out with them pretty often. 

I felt quite insecure whenever he goes out with these friends. I knew I wasn't confident of myself. I felt his friends are more fun and better looking than me.

I got tired of feeling insecure all the time. And when I met someone who seems like the more serious type of guy, I decided to end my rs. 

This serious guy is my current one and hopefully my last one. lol.

How is he different? Like what I said before, he's a pretty average guy and the only not so average thing about him is his love for me. 

His love is like a burning charcoal. It burns slowly but steadily. Day by day, he tries to learn more and more about me and find ways to show that he cares. Slow and steady wins the race right? 

My first ex taught me the importance of communication. My second ex taught me the importance of independence. My third ex taught me the importance of confidence. My current one taught me love. 

They are all perfect in their own ways. It's just that I met them at different stages of my life. It happens that when I met my current one, I was more ready for a relationship.

You meet different people for a different reason. Just because the relationship ended, it doesn't mean the relationship wasn't real. 

You would always have something to learn from the people you meet. Along the way, you learn to become a better person. And when the time comes, you will be ready to love and meet someone deserving of your love.

62808,Help. The summer school I applied for is asking me for recommendation letter. Who do I ask to write one for me?
62807,"Freshman here. Been perturbed for a while now, after sitting for some exams that were incredibly difficult. If I didn't do well for the exams (skipped nearly half the questions and whacking others), what are my odds of passing it? Is it the norm in NUS to be able to do, like, only half the paper and still get good grades?

I keep hearing about the bellcurve thing but does it really work in the students' favour? It sounds ridiculous. For the record, the exam I sat for did have my friends and the majority of students complain about it.

62805,I thought LSM1301 was supposed to be easy... until the final paper
62803,"I am in accounting and finance field. But in a job, i was encouraged to do vba and in fact, liked it more than accounting n finance. Thinking to go for a course to further into data analytics, which i grown an interest in after my vba encounter . The thing is, will employers employ me when i have no experience and how is work in data analytics like? Does it allow one to work from home too after i start a family?"
62801,"Hi OP of #62801, this might sound very cliche but really, the only way to get over someone is allowing yourself time to do so.

Last year I got close to this guy I met through friends. We shared common interests and I used that as an excuse to ask him out. 

We would often hang out. He would lend me a listening ear whenever I need one and a shoulder to cry on when I feel down.

He even offered to piggyback me when I suddenly hurt my leg. I always thought that meant he likes me. 

Feeling hopeful, I began to ask him out more and more. However, he started keeping a distance from me. 

I took that as rejection and stopped contacting him. I played it cool but deep down I felt really hurt. 

I couldn't stop thinking about us and it upsets me whenever I see him hanging out with other people. 

I tried to find a part-time job to keep myself busy. I also went out with friends whenever I'm free. It did make me feel better, although only temporarily. 

Many nights I would recall the times we spent together. Time really heals though. My memory of us slowly faded as time passed. 

One day I bumped into him at a mutual friend's party. He offered to send me home. 

Before he left, he asked me if we could hang out again. He confessed that he liked me but didn't want to lead me on because he had a LDR back then. They had a mutual break up awhile after I stopped contacting him. 

Surprisingly I didn't feel happy when he confessed. I only felt a sense of pity because we met at the wrong time. It was then I realised I have finally gotten over him. I confessed to him that I liked him too but I have moved on.

Heartbreaks are like physical wounds. They take time to heal. You gotta wait patiently for it to heal. Sad but true.
