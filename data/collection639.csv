63999,"I'm an alumni, and since there are so many discussions on CS, can you guys share how should one pick up coding? 

Increasingly, my job requires us to work with Python and R. I find it hard to pick up as 1. I don't know where to start, and 2. I can't really set aside time to study/practise it.

Thank you!"
63998,I'm thinking of doing a masters in CS. Does anyone know how NUS compares with Georgia Tech and Duke?
63997,"Hearing everyone around me talk incessantly about internships, careers and high salaries really drains me. My well-intentioned friends keep plying with me internship and research openings, hoping that I won't 'waste' my good grades (FCH). I recognize that there's so much more I can achieve if I devoted my life to building a career, but I don't feel like i'm that kind of person. As much as I try to live by my own terms, society's expectations does get to me and I feel very inferior for not possessing that same hustle. I wonder if there are others like me out there? It's hard after being used to years of stellar grades, but I want to be content with being mediocre. :("
63993,"To #63977, if you want that first class/ second upper degree, get rid of that B and make the life of future you easier. Besides, if you want to there are other ways to showcase your skills, like having your own projects/interests.

63992,"hello i was just wondering if anyone face the same situation as me. when i am in a social setting like a camp, what do i say when people ask me to share some love stories about myself that i have gone through? imo i dont feel like sharing so much bcos i barely met these people and a bit ps to let them know my r/s status too cos im not attached. is there a polite/funny way to not disclose anything without coming across as too stand-offish or 'boring'?? help pls!"
63989,"So I'm an exchange student and I got a D+ on a subject. I'm only pass/fail, this is a fail though, right? Would there be any point trying to get the result reviewed, or should I just accept the fail? Thanks :D"
63988,"To OP of #63988,
mate , if she was single all this time and you guys haven't gotten together, it's not gonna happen. Sorry to be harsh but I feel you should stop romanticizing the idea of her and just have more frame for yourself. Don't have oneitis and go out there, meet new people and move on man. Life's short - don't waste it thinking about what ifs."

So far ive taken 3 of these mods which have single-handedly pulled my cap down from a high 2nd upper to a borderline case."

63976,"I’m a Singaporean, always will be. But I have grown up half of my life in Melbourne. Currently I am studying in Monash but have reached out to Singaporean international students society to keep in touch with my roots more.

My story is one that’s is unique, I lived and settled in Box Hill (the largest Chinese Australian community in Melbourne), as a result I had very little angmoh friends and most of my friends are either ABCs or Singaporean students.

I am so saddened to see how many Singaporeans are ashamed of their identity so much that they will fake accents once they go back to Singapore for a holiday, not most Singaporeans overseas but a lot. Why? Life is so tough back home? I get it. But I don’t have it easier as I went to a selective school here, added the fact that I deal with everyday burdens of getting good grades and the pressure to assimilate (to find the best of both worlds). Try to have some contentment with your Singaporean identity, a few of my ABC friends tell me they want to move to Singapore because it meets their needs of balancing Asian and Western culture together.

But that said I do find myself in a dilemma where I am confused and conflicted about my cultural identity. Singaporeans find me too ‘angmoh’, angmohs find me too ‘Asian’ while ABCs see me as ‘Nick Young’... like what lmao. I do find myself being able to connect with both Singaporeans and ABCs but I feel like I can’t truly fit into either groups. So who am I? Which group do I belong to?"
63975,"#63975 response to  @Nigel Sim comments, it’s funny how you assume I am rich because I studied overseas. Quiet the opposite actually, I’m from an average background where my Dad had to give up his stable office job in Singapore and work long bloody hours in gardens in Australia to make ends meet for me my siblings to get a quality education, as well as to pay my weekend tuition fees to get good grades."
63974,I'm a year 1 student from EE and very demoralised after receiving my results with an average of Bs and Cs.. It seems like the average grades across year 1 EE students are B+ and A- :(
63970,"Results just got released. I need some advice. I am going to Y3 soon and this is my last chance to use all 3 of my remaining SUs. I will not need it for any UEs because I am going on exchange soon. Should I S/U an A-? This is the classic S/U dilemma. Also, should I also S/U my A grade? Will that improve my chance of getting onto the dean's list? Thanks for your help!"
63969,"Seeing all the fat salaries posted here recently made me very envious and dejected. I got my only offer from a manufacturing SME for only 2700 after going for more than 20 interviews. As a 2nd lower in engineering, I know I have to be realistic about pay but I don’t know if this company has gone overboard. Somemore it’s located in an ulu area in the jurong industrial area. Am I being lowballed a lot? I have to start earning money to help my family as my dad is about to retire in a few months and I have 2 siblings still in school. I can earn more as a full time grab driver or private tutor. But these experiences are useless and no one would recognize them in the future. Should I hold out for better offers?"
63964,Is it possible to pursue postgraduate studies aka research career path if my cap is below 4? I am a CS major >.<
63958,"I'm an incoming cs student. 

Unlike my NS peers who want get first class honors, I aspire to dropout by year 3. Maybe take a leave of absence first, then drop out permanently.

I don't drink since I am allergic to alcohol. Have also seen a no. of sell side guys who eschew from it due to diet / religious reasons. We are still doing pretty ok.

Life can go on without succumbing to peer pressure. Not taking a drink is not gonna make you unemployable."
63954,"Hi guys,
With all these posts about Engineering graduates getting decent pay recently, could anyone give advice on which area or industry actually pay a gross of more than 5k/month?

I'm a NUS scholar in Engineering, Dean list, FCH, have few internships under my belt and are enrolled in other few competitive programs within engineering as well. And tbh, I'm starting to look at jobs in finance etc because the prospect within engineering is bleak.

Sincerely looking for advice. All comments are welcome thanks!"
63952,"Hi, anyone knows what kind of jobs will pay the highest for FCH ? I am very thankful to achieve this but I dont like my major tbh. I am from engin but I know it isnt paid based on class.

63951,"To OP of #63829. Looking at my unofficial transcript, my cumulative CAP is 3.43. However, when I calculated my CAP manually, it tallied to 3.428. So I think a 3.994 will be rounded down to 3.99 and a 3.995 will be rounded up to a 4.0."
63950,"Hi, would like to clarify, if we exceed the 60mcs level 1k limit for modules, if we take additional level 1k mods, can it still be counted towards our cap? 
But the additional level 1k modules cannot be used to fulfill graduation requirements? For example: the additional level 1k mod cannot be used to fulfil our unrestricted electives requirement"
63949,"Received my results. Did not do as well as expected (get a second upper), but still managed to raise my cap up by 0.01 (remain at second lower). 

Is getting a second lower/merit very common? Or is it more common to get a second upper/distinction? 

Also, will it make me fare poorly among the people who got a second upper/distinction or first class/highest distinction?

Please help me out...no trolls please, I'm already pretty disappointed... (this is my last exam btw)"
63948,"So the confirmed results are out this morning. I got an A for one of the mods which i expected to get below B or even C. Finals are 50%, and I know I did very badly for the finals. No one knows better than me how I did. For the CA, I got an A and B respectively for the assignments. 

So I suspect if the examiners actually marked my scripts, or the scripts got missing and hence they assigned a grade based on my CA and class part. 

Or maybe the examiners needed some kpi so they gave inflated grades?"
63945,"Has anyone ever encountered a millennial that doesn't use his/her phone at all during conversations?

Don't bother answering. Such a millennial no longer exists in this world. 

Using phones even during convo's seems such the norm these days (and there's a term for it called 'phubbing') that it's just plain sad. Even more sad when you're trying to talk to the person and the person just keeps using the phone (not even to text, but to just play games). It makes you feel awkward unless you copy along with this stupid 'phubbing' as well.

If someone finds a young person that doesn't do this, please tell me. Such a person deserves the Nobel prize."
63943,"Well, reading at NUSWhispers makes me understand why people said having high qualifications doesn’t means high common sense.

Let’s say as a fresh grads, you want a 100k per annum job and you went to so many interviews that reality hits you so hard that you cry on this page every single day.

And you still doesn’t know why employers are so bad. Why won’t they just pay us 100k per annum?

If you want 100k per annum income, you need to be able to produce profit for the company by hiring you. Which also means produce results that is at least able to cover the cost of expenses and your salary. 
*if you still don’t dont understand* This also means by hiring you, your existence need to generate at least $333,333 in company revenue with 70-30 ratio.

No employers want to hire you to make their companies bankrupt.

So ask yourself if you can bring in this amount of revenue in the first place."
63942,"Currently in the midst of accepting a job offer from an MNC (I graduate next year).


Before reading NUSWhispers:
Niccce! I can finally relieve myself of employment worries, collect my ~3k pay and begin my climb up the corporate ladder


After reading NUSWhispers:
Oh no, am i being shortchanged? If I sign now, what if I chance upon a better opportunity? But if I don't accept, what if I don't come across any similar opportunities?? *STRESS*


Thanks everyone... 


HAHA but anyway, I really do like this company and the team I will be working with. Just that sometimes, it's hard to focus on yourself when everyone is comparing with one another.


Proper question though: having secured a job offer, does that mean I can just do the minimum for the remaining uni life? Maybe focus on earning money through teaching tuition or become a Grab driver/food delivery."

63940,"Reaching out to others has been nothing but a tiring experience for me. It's always easy to say that you should take the initiative if you want to keep in contact, but the hard part is when you see those years of effort gone down the drain when they see it merely as a chore, and eventually coming to a realization that they are more focused on ranting to their new friends about having to take time to meet you than appreciating your efforts.

All those well-thought out gifts, checking in to see how they are doing but not a single word of gratitude really makes me feel more jaded towards relationships. As I see their online posts expressing gratitude towards their newly found friends for standing by them and being there for them, I felt so insulted for being such an idiot to help them out in times of need only to be conveniently forgotten.

Now I understand why there's no point in trying to reconnect with old friends, because they will simply brush off your presence as nuisance."

Good luck to the people taking all these csb advices blindly. If you’re lucky you might actually land one, maybe if you’re FCH and is 1 out of 200 applicants. But be prepared to be ignored by employers if your field had a lot of FT + not comp sc + asking for 5.5k salary with no experience.

I doubt if you’re in manufacturing so stop generalizing “engineering”. Either that or you’re calculating by 4k x 12 months + 1 month aws + 3 months bonus in order to get 5.5k.

You people are the reason why Singapore has more and more desktop engineers who knows nothing about hands on skills and think engineering is about excel spreadsheets, contributes nothing to the company technology roadmap while asking for high pay.

63914,"As a ""accidental"" business owner making 5 digits a month and currently in my late 20s, my advice for you guys still studying would be to not be a tryhard. Now, in hindsight, this may not make sense to a lot of people. A lot of people would think that they HAVE to try as hard as possible to reach success. However, I feel that sometimes when you don't try, success ends up coming for you instead. It's a weird phenomenon, which I guess can only be explained by how when you're not being a tryhard, people find you more friendly and approachable and are more willing to help you out, share opportunities with you, etc. Basically, you end up having a powerful network of people.

Now, why I say that I am an ""accidental"" business owner is because all along I never really actively tried to be an entrepreneur. I worked a bunch of part-time jobs during my free time that most people would look down on (think retail jobs, sales jobs) and I ended up learning about the businesses, product knowledge and some street smarts through all those experiences. Eventually, I accumulated a decent sum of savings from all my time working in those jobs and working in those jobs gave me an idea to exploit an opportunity to make more money. Before I knew it, I was setting up a Pte Ltd and the rest is history. I was never a tryhard, I didn't score straight A's, I didn't land a well-paying corporate job, but I ended up making much more than most of my peers. I couldn't have done this if I had an elitist mindset and looked down on part-time retail/sales jobs and refused to work."

The earliest one happned a few days ago where I dreamt that my Grandma only have a few days to live and I started crying in my sleep. The second one was when my neighbour suicide in his apartment and the police even came down to conduct investigations. Yes, I don't know why both of them are about people dying but it's honestly scary. The last one just happened a few minutes ago and I was freaked out by this one, as if my grandma dying wasn't scary enough. Touch wood touch wood she will live till 100. Anyways, I dreamt that I was involved in a terrorist attack with my parents and I was let of early but it was a scheme by the terrorist to let us all get killed on the way back. I seriously don't know why these dreams are vivid and horrifying it's draining me even in my sleep. I had similar dreams before exams and I reckon its normal bcos I was stress then but it's the holidays now so I don't know why it's back again.

Engineering - Manufacturing
Normal industry range: 3-3.5  
Top 10% AND FCH: 3.6-4k (4 is the absolute highest I’ve ever seen any MNC offers, anyone who says they got more is either including employer cpf contribution or they’ve have same special relationship with the company)

Engineering - Software
Normal range: 4k-6k
Top 10%: all the sky high pay that you’ve seen on NUSWhispers

BA - Marketing/Analysts etc
Normal range: 4.5-5.5k
Rare: unless you work in a bank or Fortune 500. 

Accounting everyone earns about the same, you start with 2.8 and get like 20% increment every year consecutively until you hit 5 figures within 5-8 years."

63900,"I’m a foreigner girl, currently dating a singaporean boy. When we first started dating, I often asked him whether he was sure about us, specifically about me being non-singaporean. I actually felt inferior to singaporean girls because it is actually more troublesome to date foreigners: citizenship, job prospects and most importantly, housing matters aka BTO. I felt bad that we cannot just straightaway apply for a house solely because i’m a foreigner. 

But thankfully, he assured me that nationality wasn’t really a consideration, especially among others - our personalities, our chemistry, our common experiences, and our relationship approaches. And I guess that’s how relationship should work, instead of merely comparing the over-generalised traits between singaporean girls and foreigner girls.

And also, to clarify some of the generalisations about foreigner girls which are more wrong than right: 1) myself and many of my friends are from cities, not villages. 2) I don’t have 9 siblings, 2 kids are more than enough to my parents. 3) i didn’t choose singapore, singapore chose me first. 4) i feel really bad if i ever have to rely on him for citizenship so i do hope i can somehow obtain it with my own efforts. 5) i don’t think i’m better any singaporean girls, neither do i think that anyone deserves any rights to look down on or cast ill-informed judgement on others, whether singaporeans or foreigners.

Relationship is work, really. If you are willing to work for it, it doesn’t matter whether you are dating a singaporean or a foreigner :”)"
