58497,"Just 3 days after Valentines day, and I found out my gf has been secretly texting intimate things with her colleague from a mutual friend of ours..what should I do?"

58491,"#58491

Hey there I'm not sure if you're the same person who posted a similar confession previously. I personally experienced incidents 1 & 2 also, but not 3

I was brought up in a family environment that made me have serious trust issues, resulting in me being pretty wary of everyone and building a wall around myself. Since my kindergarten days, everyday was spent feeling pretty emotionless and dead on the inside, where I was neither joyful nor angry, with my classmates all remarking that I was a ""cool and calm"" person. Watching movies with friends became a slight problem as they preferred the sad kinds, where they'd bawl their eyes out and look questiningly at me when I didn't join them

Things got pretty heated at home when I was in sec 4 and something snapped inside me, leading me to confide in a trusted adult. While I didn't think that things felt any different after that, it seems like the wall that has been built around me started cracking without me noticing and I started to feel a tiny bit of emotions (on hindsight)

It took a failed relationship in jc to open the emotional floodgates probably because I'm now able to relate to the sad songs and movies, but I will most definitely not recommend that you follow this route hahaha the pain and emotions are not worth the trouble. And even if the relationship works out, it may not be very healthy too as you've not gone into it with the right mindset. One op suggested googling ""alexythymia"" which you can try as well to see if you're able to relate to the descriptions there 

This took quite a bit of courage to write and I hope you won't feel that you're alone on this journey. All the best and good luck to you!"
58490,Is it normal to like a girl much younger than you (say 6/7 years) if she is really very mature? 
58489,I'm from SIM and a proud student too. NUS kids should not make fun of us too often. After all we both made it to university by our merits. 
58487,"I don't know why people say that if you're rich or good looking or funny, you'll naturally attract a lot of girls to you. That's not always true. Over the years, I've been described by people around me as good looking, smart, hardworking (you have no idea how hard i've worked over the years), wealthy, nice and thoughtful. I've always been the outdoorsy kind and recently became more sporty and fit. Yet despite all the stereotype things that you'll assume girls would like in a guy, I've been rejected countless of times by many girls. I've tried meeting girls online and offline and yes, we do go out on dates and stuff, and the dates seem to go well (lots of laughter and stuff) but I never really get them to fall for me. Months and weeks of effort can to go to waste as they tell me, ""you're not what I'm looking for"" and then things come to a stop. Apart of me feels frustrated for being that nice guy and sometimes I feel that me being ""nice"" is the reason why I'm unattractive to girls. Sometimes, I'm always thinking, those girls are single for a reason. I like to think it's because they're overly picky or are overly entitled. They complain about not being able to find a boyfriend, despite the fact that sometimes there are some really good ones right in front of them but they are too arrogant to see it. In their minds only those popular few guys are good enough for them, but man do they fail to look in the mirror to examine their own attributes, they ain't got much going for them. And then other times, I like to think that I am the problem, I'm not wild or exciting enough to attract their attention. Maybe there's something I am not doing right...

I don't ask a lot in a girl, just one who gets along with me well and cares for me as much as I care about her. Is it really that hard to find someone like that?"

58481,"#58435 fully agree with you. It's really frustrating to see that many students are using the excuse of dance/inter-hall games/inter-college games etc to ask for an assignment extension or to skip a particular class. All of these deadlines are the minimum expectations when you choose to attend university, and this mimics real life. Would you go to your boss in the future and ask for an extension because you have an outside dance rehearsal? If you cannot manage so many things at once, learn to give up some. Ultimately your studies should be the first priority, if you can't manage that then don't even bother coming to school. Don't waste your parents money."

58476,"To #58407: I am a good 10 cm taller than my fiancé. It is unfortunate that height is often a deal breaker for many women. 

To all women out there, I think there are other more important factors to consider:

- Do you have similar values/common interests?
- Can you communicate with each other?
- Is he committed to making the relationship work? 
- Do you have similar lifestyles?

Unless you want to produce super model children, it is a little short-sighted to eliminate short(er) guys.

58474,"Guys investing in flowers and dinners are actually good if you want a rock solid relationship. Dinners you get chance of photo-op and will be engraved into Instagram when she uploads the photos. When she look at her insta next day she will be reminded of the nice food and your effort.

Flowers don’t wilt the next day, in fact they last a few day. Making her feel happy and important.

So your presence can even be felt for the next few days, without doing anything.

Plus the fact is that flowers and dinner is actually quite Low hanging fruit.  You don’t need much effort to buy flowers or dinner. It is not like hand-making a card for which it takes precious time.

So two ways, either you ignore valentine and build resentment OR you give a gd investment and reap the positive rewards.

Always remember you should continue to do this even after marriage and don’t slacken off.

My only concern is flowers do have a carbon footprint. Don’t buy too many. V day and anniversary twice a year good enough. 

My advice will save you from a life time of nagging. "
58473,"To #58473: Yes. Students do, especially students who have dealt with depression before - they might even feel empathy. Also, if you are a professor writing this and struggling, consider speaking to someone. It must be tough juggling personal responsibilities and the pressure to produce good research. If you're not comfortable with speaking to someone from school, there are quite a few good private doctors around. Take care!"
58472,"Not a confession, but rather a question. To all the girls reading this, what's the shortest height you find acceptable when it comes to dating a guy?"
58471,"#58433 when you get attached, you will realise that a good v day celebration is very worth the money. A good dinner of 200 bucks and flowers of 100dollars Will save you from nags and keep her happy.

-Why is GEQ1000 CS/CU while GER1000 is graded (i.e. factored into CAP or eligible for S/U)?

58468,"for #58437:  'This valentines day is so disappointing..'
I can relate that.
Out of 8 billion people in the world, everyone has a different understanding and values in love. Love, mostly, starts with all the expression of affection, moves and scripts that learned from movies...
Sometimes, have u wondered, as two people get closer for a longer period of time, will u still enthusiastically do so?
Like you love your family, but you never say 'I love u' to them frequently or buy presents. Sometimes, love is simple, it doesn't need all the prescripted actions.
You just need to try to live in his/her life, truly understand what he/she needs, and being supportive.

ps: I do realise, sometimes, or for some man, women need to go in his life, be part of his life, let him can't live without u, and remain a sense of challenge and mystery for him."
58467,"Ugh this GER1000 mod may be interesting and useful, but it DOES NOT ""spark joy"". More like causing confusion and frustration instead, with its ambiguous phrasing in both the slides/script and the quizzes. 
Can the GER team please try out their quiz before they put it up (maybe ask a non-expert who could spot errors that the teaching team would not be able to see) and see if it would cause great misunderstandings. Maybe they could collaborate with CELC to vet through the English. 
This is certainly not the first time that two different ans were accepted for MCQ quizzes (as it usually is for this format of assessment) and certainly will not be the last, but perhaps it would be helpful to try to minimise such instances."
58466,"The master key opening many locks analogy is pretty true actually. It is so much easier as a girl to get a guy to sleep with you than it is vice versa. So obviously the fuccboi gets a ""better"" rep than the slut. There is no equal ground here

58464,"Got a few people asking/suggesting that online matchmaking events (valentine's or not) should be round robin/bachelorette/battle royale style to mitigate the gender ratio issue. 

I understand the rationale of giving the girls more choice. But it seems like this might foster a competitive and inauthentic experience in the group chat, where the guys may try too hard to seem desirable to impress the girl and emerge champion, instead of being their true selves. And that might be kinda stressful for the girls too. 

If you have any thoughts on this, please leave a comment. And no, the matches for the recent event weren't ""random"". "
58463,"Those posts about hapless BFs and disappointed GFs on V-Day are funny, unlike you guys it is my Gf that does things for me instead on V-Day as the dynamics in our relationship are different. She is the one that is seeking to please me and my company and attention is all she needs to be happy. For guys it is better to let the the girl qualify themselves instead of you doing so. Being guys we are also more chill on our requirements so there's less pressure and drama for all and we can both have an enjoyable V-Day instead of playing guessing games and quarrelling over silly things. So if you guys want no drama next year try taking a more dominant role in your RS."
58462,"Disclaimer: this is not to trivialise the OP of #58462;

Saw several comments about how OP could be lucky in some sense. I'm not sure if they fully understood the situation. As a fellow suffer of similar conditions, I thought I should put this out. For people who are unfamiliar, perhaps you can consider watching the HIMYM episode where Robin discovered that she was infertile to get a glimpse of what it's like. 

I suffer from something similar. I was a party girl for some years of my life. ( My infertility had nothing to do with my partying or sexual behaviour. Signs of infertility was already showing way before I was sexually active) And I knew I never wanted kids. To some people, I probably struck the lottery of casual sex. 

But that's not what this is. 

This is about losing control over your own damn body. Not having kids used to be a choice that you could reverse up until a certain age. Not anymore. And it feels as if your body betrayed you. While you know that you have to love and be yourself because you have no other choice, sometimes you just can't help feeling dysfunctional. 

To add insult to injury, I became an ex party girl. Again, not by choice but because I no longer had the drive. 

I am not asking for sympathy or encouragement. I'm just saying that in life you gain some and you lose some. To OP of #58462, chin up. Perhaps the condition could even help you sieve out those who would love you for who you are, infertility and all your quirks. 

On the note of the party girl thing. I am really glad I had the wildest bedroom adventures in the years before I totally lost my drive.

So really, my 2cents is, as long as you stay safe, and handle relationships appropriately (e.g. don't cheat! Not classy!), there really shouldn't be a moral judgement to human sexuality. To quote a finance concept, this could be a time value of money thing. Also, old saying, a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush. So have fun kiddos, and stay safe!"

58453,"Why do girls go for the guys with a ""reputation"" instead of going for the good guys?

My female friends keep going for the ""bad boys"" and I can't figure it out. Like, why would you want to date someone with a reputation for sleeping around? Or why would you want to date someone who's known to be a player?

Is it because of the sex? But that can't be right, most of them who get attached to the bad boys still complain about the sex... Is it just a ""bad boy"" vibe thing and us average/nice guys just lose out?"
58452,"I know people are going to judge me very harshly for this, but I guess I need some place to vent it.

I cheated on my ex with my current boyfriend. It was supposed to be a short term thing while I was still attached to my ex, since our sex life had dried up and to be honest, it was pretty unsatisfactory. To make matters worse, through the year or so we were together, we weren't meeting much, and for the entire relationship, you could count on two hands the number of proper dates that didn't end in an argument, and on one hand the number of times we had sex, so we weren't in a good place in the relationship.

Then I met my current bf during lectures. He was kinda cute and seemed to be a decent person, so one day I guess it got the better of us and we made out in an empty LT that we were studying in.

A few days later, I went over to his place to study together. One thing led to another, and we ended up having sex. I went home after, but I went over the week later and we did the deed again. It's not so much that I wanted intimacy, but really there was a serious lack of it. I was stressed and decided why not, since my relationship was clearly going nowhere.

I broke up with my boyfriend maybe a few months later, and decided to get together with my current bf. It might make me sound like a terrible person, but I don't regret leaving my ex for him. We have a good sex life, and he makes an effort to meet up, we're emotionally compatible and click very well. We've been together for about a year, and we're still making an effort with each other, and I can honestly say we both see this going further.

I guess people would judge us harshly if they knew how we started out, but I honestly don't think people around us need to know. Why am I posting this? I just needed the space to vent - I don't think they need to know, but I'm constantly worried that they'll judge my relationship exclusively on the basis of how it started.

The problem is this idea was not feasible because you know how expensive a condo is without any grant. Even if we can afford it, it doesn’t makes sense to forfeit a 40k grant. I find that the way she handles finances is very impulsive and inconsiderate to her future spouse. She doesnt hold a job of more than $4k but she already expecting a condo after marriage. That means she is expecting a guy to have a stable income of more than $4k in order to support the lifestyle. I find that she is expecting too much as a young adult and only limit her prospect to be high income earner even before we met.

So far I have never gotten anything for him for special occasions because he would say he doesn't want anything but I make scrapbooks for his birthday every year.

I would also remind him that I want a one-carat diamond ring from any established brands and 99 roses if he wants to propose and he agreed to get them when he starts working. He would offer to pay for shoes, clothes, bags that I say I fancy whenever we go out.

But what I find increasingly peeving is that despite her age, she is still very child-like in nature with no goals, no future planning, and is practically dependent on me for all things serious that we do together (BTO, holidays etc). 

For one, she has been working for close to two years now and her income/money is still being stored in an ordinary savings account despite the many times i've told her to use a multiplier-like account instead for much greater returns. Secondly, for holidays we take together, I've always been the one planning and booking everything - from the air tickets to our accommodation to our itinerary (the bright side of this is she really doesn't complain about where we go and I get to decide almost everytime). Also, she recently bought an insurance plan from one of her relatives, but she has absolutely no idea how much she's paying and what the plan entails; her relative just approached her and she just agreed. She only knows that she would be paying ""a few hundred dollars"" a month. I'm really shaking my head thinking wth as i type this. 

And it's not as if i haven't tried talking to her about it. Everytime I bring up something serious that I would like her to do, she would casually brush it off with ""I dont know how to do it"" or ""i don't know la"" and get visibly annoyed if i push further. Things only happen if i do it with her, and most of the time i end up doing it for her, like bringing her to upgrade her mobile plan. Sometimes I really feel like I have a daughter instead of a girlfriend, and it's really tiring to be the one always doing all the work.

It's on Vday that I found that my gf actually like diy gift rather than me spending money on food/dress/decoration.

I knew he saw me, I don't know why i did this, I pretended to like this guy friend I was with by acting flirty and giggling at him. He didn't even bother to say hi and walked away. I saw his instagram story of him cycling around nus on vday and I can't help but think he was with another girl. I still like him, what should i do??"

My gf told me not to get any roses for V day and she explained to me that it's expensive. Ofc i read all the facebook posts saying that this might be a trap. So in the end I still bought the roses, ready to surprise her.

On that day, I showed her the roses and wow, her face became black. She wasn't happy or excited about it. She just keep saying the money could have been better spent in something else. 

On hindsight, she really did say roses are expensive in a serious tone, but I just didn't care.

Lesson learnt: go and learn about your girl to see whether she expect or don't expect roses. (actually guys if yall still dk, just play safe, get some pretty flowers but not roses/sunflower - coz it's overly expensive)

In japan school, the girls of the class usually pile chocolates and other treats in the teacher desk for their male classmates to share during valentines and the guys would return the flavour during white day.

sad thing for forever alone guys and girls in sg here."
58417,#58384 it's traditional for the male to do something for the female on Valentine's day?! Isn't it the other way around - girls get guys chocolates on vday while guys return a gift 3 times the value on White's Day?
58416,"The amount of troll posts of guys pretending to be shitty girls is too damn high. My theory is that these guys do it to beat out the competition by inducing girl phobia. While us guys on NUSWhispers get mad and think all SG girls are shit, those guys out there getting the good girls, and end up we really left with only the shit girls."
58412,Does UHC offers pregnancy tests? Wonder if this is a common thing? Just concerned if I may be pregnant cause my period cycle is unstable and my partner and I may have done it when I was fertile. Not very sure but hoping to find out as soon as possible so less things can be done about it and without my parents being alerted. Anyone know what to do? 
58410,Wonder where do poly students who work hard to come to NUS stand on the bellcurve. Do they lose out or have an advantage as compared to the JC students?
58407,"To #58407: I am a good 10 cm taller than my fiancé. It is unfortunate that height is often a deal breaker for many women. 

To all women out there, I think there are other more important factors to consider:

- Do you have similar values/common interests?
- Can you communicate with each other?
- Is he committed to making the relationship work? 
- Do you have similar lifestyles?

Unless you want to produce super model children, it is a little short-sighted to eliminate short(er) guys.

58406,"@#58406: I'm fully in support of this. Why are business students being forced to learn IT and data science modules when they're not even in school of computing? I mean, if that's the area I want to pursue in the future, I wouldn't freaking be going to business school, would I?

FYI there's this petition made from last time. https://www.change.org/p/nus-bba-office-dao2702-s-u-able

To any biz students reading this (well, seems like your typical biz students doesn't read NUSWhispers but whatever), PLEASE sign the petition. 
NUS BBA didn't have an analytics core last time. I seriously hate how they just added it in for the newer 2017 cohort now. "
58405,what's with profs telling us whats tested less than a week before the actual exam? why cant they include it in their module forecast? do they expect every single student to send them emails to ask?
58404,"What's with this influx of ""i didn't get anything from my bf"" ""i said no to flowers, and really didn't get anything"" etcetc posts here? 

As a female myself, of course I understand wanting to be surprised by your bf, to not want to state things out so explicitly. But in all honesty, why are we even expecting males to keep doing things for us on vday? How about YOU do it first, to text him first, to give him chocolates (if not flowers) to wish him happy vday first? As far as I know, its Valentines Day, not My-BF-Owes-Me-Flowers/Letters/Dinner/Whatever Day. 

If you want something, learn how to ask for it. Tell your bf you want to celebrate vday. TALK. As many have already pointed out, no one is a mind reader. Discuss your expectations. How do you keep a relationship if you refuse to even let the other party know what you expect?? 

On that note, perhaps ask yourself why is it that you even WANT these flowers/whatever from your bf. To show off to others how sweet your bf is? To assure yourself he really loves you? Or because 'everyone else got them, why didn't I?'?

If its any of the above, then start thinking about why you are even in this relationship. Or what can YOU do to improve your relationship. Its YOUR happiness. "
58403,I'm a CS fresh grad going to Apple cupertino in august. It will be my first time travelling far away alone. Is anyone else going (nearby) there?
58402,"entitled girls should know that traditionally it is girls who are to do stuff for bf on vday. guys are to return the favor on white day. so instead of asking ur bf to do something, why not u do something first. im a gal and i dont mind making the first move."
58401,Just wanna give a shoutout to the DAO2702 team this semester! Really appreciate the effort to structure and make the content accessible for us (especially after the whole fiasco last sem). Keep it up :)
