And the rant from the girl who accuses her hostel-mate of being a gay/pervert/thief got me thinking. I'm not sure if she's referring to me, or are there really people who spread slander just because of the clothes people wear. On Lazada, these FBTs are classified under unisex anyway. I didn't go to NS, so I don't know if FBTs are cheaper than army PT shorts. I'm a dumb foreigner. So when I saw FBTs in Utown selling for less than $8, I bought a few of them, not knowing the stigma behind them. FBTs are cheap, cooling, comfortable, so why don't more guys wear them? Perhaps if more guys do, then it'll be normalised."

60196,"My girlfriend and I just decided to spend some time apart because she wanted to see other guys. And up till 1 hour ago I was devastated that I might have lost the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.
I was taking bus 983 and just thinking about life when I saw this girl sitting opposite me also obviously zoning out. With her long hair and the setting sun falling over half her face I could not help but keep staring. She was listening to music on her headphones but I noticed she did not touch her phone or even carry a bag. How cool is that in modern society? 
I must have stared at her for about 10minutes and she must have definitely sensed it because our eyes met. And for that brief second I felt like she was looking into my soul. My face was burning but I could not tear my eyes away even as she gave me one last glance and looked back out the window.
I wanted so desperately to approach her but while I was gathering my courage she stood up. I could only watch as she dropped at the 801C bus stop at Keat Hong and walked out of my life. 
I am so conflicted now. I still love my girlfriend and I think I should get her back? I know that we are compatible enough. But I think I might have just missed my soulmate... "

My bf and I will update each other about our whereabouts and the stuff we were doing but just recently he stopped doing it.

He used to tell me that he will be playing game, and told me to go ahead and rest first. However recently, he went on playing his games without telling me and I look like an idiot waiting for his replies and hoping that every notification i have will be a text from him.

Yesterday, he send me a text at about 11:20pm,  telling me that he will be going to sleep. So we said goodnight and we both went to sleep.

Just this morning, I casually open my zenly app and found out that his last location was in jb 9 hours ago. So I asked him if he went jb yesterday night and he told me he did. He said that it was a last minute thing. It just merely takes 10 seconds to type ""my friend last min jio me go jb"". Is it that hard?

He used to tell me that he will be going jb even it was a last minute thing.

Honestly I don't know what should I do with this issue, hope that I can find some help here.

60191,"Ladies, please advise.

Is it normal for a girl to go out with other guy friends for 1 to 1 dinner and movies? There’s this girl I have been texting who has lots of guy friends and goes out with them 2-3 times a week. It is a 1 to 1 every single time. Every time I ask her about it, she would deny saying that she is just friends with them and that she prefers to meet in smaller groups. Is this another “There is nothing to worry about”, then 2 months later she gets attached kind of scenario?

Can I have some opinion or advice on this? It has been bothering me for a while. Is she just being dense or seeking for more options because I feel like a spare? I really don’t see how having so many 1 to 1 meet up with guys can be normal? Am I thinking too much? Please advice because I don't want this to end up as another heartbreak. "
60189,"Dear CS2030's Professors and Lab Tutor Assistants,

Firstly, I would like to do an anonymous feedback to our Professors. To start off, I would like to apologise to both of you that I honestly do not know what have been happening in this module for the past 8 weeks. (Even after attending the weekly 2 hours of lecture, 2 hours of lab, 1 hour of tutorial and rewatching Monday and Wednesday's Webcasts)

For the first half of the semester, I felt that the prof does not even care for us.

He conducted his lecture by assuming that all of us already know Java (Object-Oriented Programming) and know how to use Vim. He doesn't fully utilize the lecture notes (Skipping slides here and there) but does a lot of live demos (Using terms that he assumed that we already know). These made our understanding and learning harder.

Yes, I know that we are now young-adults and we should be responsible with our own learning. However, if we need to learn everything on our own by searching on Google, then shouldn't I be paying my school fees to their company?

Next, may I know what is the purpose of attending the weekly 2 hours of lab? Every Tuesday Lab Routine: Arrive lab, => find a PC => login to codecrunch => code for 2 hours => dismiss => (Bring home my code, continue to code and submit by Sunday 23:59). Throughout the routine, my lab tutor assistant does not mention a word (Not even a single instruction, no guildance & no question was answered).

To all current and future lab tutor assistants, we know that you have obtained very good grades. However, if you cannot express yourselves or cannot answer any questions at all, then please do not register to be a TA (DO NOT REGISTER FOR THE $$). We really need people who can help us out!!

Regarding our Practical Assessment 1, both test date and test scope were released very last minutes. On the day itself, our PCs were spoiled and the instructions were not clearly stated. For example, if we were not allowed to change the Main method, why was it stated at the back of the Level?

Understand that the professors will be using their skeleton, Main.java and I have to revert my code as followed. This means that number of lines changed increases. According to this semester professor, they make use of AI to do the marking. Thus, I highly feel that the marking is not fair at all.

To be continued..."
60187,"Sometimes I envy my classmates who come from wealthy background. I'm totally not one of them. My parents are not highly educated. They earn peanuts and always struggle to make end meets. Because of this, I am told to be more diligent, get a well-paying job and not end up like them. Since I was young, I have learned to manage my own money and be thrifty in my spending. 

Whenever I go out with some of my friends, they buy whatever they like without looking at the price. I know that their parents give them alot of money and can provide them with anything. Often, my friends would tease me for being thrifty. I would simply say ""thrift is a virtue"" but I felt terrible when they said that. 

However, I am still grateful that I have a roof over my head and food to fill me up. My parents know I do not spend alot, but still remind me to have proper meals. Even though they are unable to pay for my study, I manage to get a low wage part-time job as a cashier and finance myself without asking money from them. During school breaks when I earn more, I could give some money to my parents. 

There are valuable things that my parents taught me better what schools had taught me. These are values and characters that money could not buy. In the past, I grew up thinking that why can't my parents be like other parents? I was wrong, because my parents have always given me their best, like any other parents. Now, I become more independent and hardworking everyday. Soon, I am able to repay the love and care that my parents have given me. "
60183,"I had a crush on my TA and didn't have the courage to ask him out. I just met him by chance yesterday.

I took his class one year ago, and he caught my eye with his good look. He was passionate in explaining things to students, and I found his foreigner's English accent so cute. My friends knew and kept teasing him when he came to help me with the assignment. I felt embarrassed but also curious about his reaction. He just smiled every time, and I guessed he couldn't do anything more than that as he's doing his job. I put a lot of effort into studying the module and got the highest score in his class, I hoped it could make him notice me that way.

I wanted to tell him when the semester ended, but my insecurity got in the way. He got that cute smile, muscular build, and a much fairer skin tone than mine. This sounded shitty to write out loud, but I kept wondering if I was beautiful enough for him.

I noticed him having dinner alone yesterday and joined him. We caught up and talked about personal stuff for the first time. He jokingly said he wanted to ask me out but somehow thought I had a boyfriend as I posted a lot of pics with my brother on Instagram. I was speechless.

 I confessed to him, but both of us knew it would not go anywhere. I will graduate soon and work overseas while he stays here for at least 3 years. We said goodbye, life went on. I keep fantasizing to be with him, but there is not much I can do now."
60182,"So, two years ago I got together with a girl and because of some reasons, a few months later we stopped talking since then and we removed each other from social media (we did not block each other so it is still possible for us to add each other back).

60181,"OP of #60181,

I cringed so hard when I read your post, no offence. I'm going to get a lot of flak for this, but the truth is if you stop acting so beta and acquire some self-worth and self-love, chances are you'll do much better. Your actions reflect those of a person who is desperate for companionship and that is an immediate no-no.

I may sound harsh here, but I sincerely just want to help. Seriously, invest in yourself - physically, mentally, emotionally, financially etc - and I dare you to return without results. 

Also, 'she dated close to about 10 other guys but none lasted more than 7 months' . WHAT - are you kidding me? Are you so dull as to not immediately spot these tell-tale signs from a mile away?

Nonetheless, all the best =)"

1. “Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part.”
- Last year, 206 teams (412 students) was accepted into Orbital. This year, 576 students are accepted into Orbital. With a 40% increase in intake even though the number of students enrolling into SoC is much lower, how is it fair to say that the coordinator had bad planning? Note that there wasn’t anyone whining about Orbital unlike the kids this year. 

2. “It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day.”

1. “So what kind of concerns are there to prevent taking in more students for Orbital? The cohort size is 1k, yet the intake is only 500.”
- Students need to be graded on the level of achievement. This requires manpower nonetheless. The purpose of the module is for seniors to mentor students on taking the first steps towards software engineering, and not a loophole for students to do shit work and get 4MCs. The higher the number of students accepted, the lower the standards of the mentors. 

2. If you can self learn and not go for workshops, why would you even need Orbital? It sounded like you are upset that there isn’t an opportunity to get 4MC even though you supposedly took it. 

3. “If your server could not handle the load of many projects registered, well…”
The purpose of the system is to accept X number of students. Clearly, that purpose has been achieved when 576 students are able to apply for it. 

4. Unfortunately, there is just a limited number of slots available for orbital. That was the same last year, it is the same this year. It has been propagated to the students that there are limited slots and its allocation is FCFS. 

Frankly, the orbital slots are final. There is just no use whining on the telegram group or on NUSWhispers. The amount of whining on these platforms is really alarming and shows the level of entitlement that you have. Just because you are in SoC, just because you are a CS major doesn’t automatically mean you are entitled to participate in Orbital and that all other majors are not as deserving of a slot as you. 

On a personal note, it’s really time for the year 1 CS students to realise that’s CS is not all cushy with free swags, flexible working hours and 5 digits intern pay. You have to earn every single one of them. Whining will get you nowhere.   It’s really time to mature up and actually ask yourself what is important to you. While the top students in SoC earn 10+k monthly, the average CS students don’t even earn half of that. It is really time to wake up and reflect on what you really want to do in NUS, learn about the science of computation, or just get an easy 4MC from Orbital."

60165,"To poster of #60105, who is jealous of her(?) best friend 

I've always had better friends than I think I deserve, and in your case I think I could understand your jealousy in the presence of someone you like but think you can never match up to. Well, in truth I don't think it's easily possible for people like us to ever feel like we will be good enough compared to those around us. They say confidence comes from within, but I think it's something you can also begin to have by believing in the people around you, like your best friend. Even if you don't understand why, everything points to her being really concerned for you. Maybe you attribute it to her just being a really perfect person, but don't forget that she likely sees something in you she values over many other people in her life - even if you can't see it yourself. Even if you don't think you're a great person at all, your friend probably really does believe you are worth her effort and friendship (or would she so readily listen to your troubles at 3am?). In your perspective maybe she's perfect (studies, looks etc), but I'm sure from her perspective she thinks highly of you as well (in ways you might think are less important but probably mean more to her). Point is, people value different things and the fact that one person (who I'm sure you also care for - or you won't feel bad about your jealousy) loves you despite whatever you think of yourself is a thing I hope you'll be able to be happy about, even if you are naturally envious of whatever you see she has that you don't.

Silly as it sounds, even if you see no positive traits in yourself, have some pride in and believe in the fact that someone as great at your friend believes in you for some reason or another, and hopefully you will start to see yourself in a better light. Your vision of yourself is important, but in times where you can only think of yourself in a negative light, don't forget to take into consideration your friend's positive view of you and draw some confidence from there!

- from someone who is also guiltily envious of her friends but has come to terms with the fact that somehow, they love her for reasons she cannot understand so perhaps she is worth something to someone"

60162,"To OP of #60162:

Every year there is about 30 SoC students who get a salary of 7-10K who doesnt have a gf. The worse thing is the nature of their job usually means they won't be meeting anyone anytime soon/ever. Welcome to the club."
60161,"Hi there, hope you are doing alright, especially since the midterms are coming to the end. If you are feeling joyful, great! But if you are not, because of whatever is happening in your life, I need to let you know something.

That its okay.

It's okay to feel lost, it's okay to feel alone, it's okay to feel hurt, troubled, sad and stressed. We all know that feeling, that feeling we get when we see others having great fun on instagram while ours seem to be more lonely. That feeling when we grind hard but still don't get the grade we want. That feeling when we practice long hours and we are still put on the reserve team. That feeling seeing couples in public while we remain alone.

And I understand. It's frustrating you see, we all don't know where life is taking us, where we are heading to or what is going to happen next. We all want to be loved, to be cared for and to be proud of ourselves. At the end of the day, we all want to be proud of the life that we have lived.

Sometimes it's hard. It's really hard to find that meaning, the one that keeps you going everyday. To others we may seem strong, cheerful and happy. But deep down, we may be more brittle than we think.

I hope you are someone who is truly strong, and leading the life you want to live. If you are, great! Help someone who is struggling and lost. But if you aren't, I hope you realize this:

It's not easy being you.

You never chose to be born, you never told god you wanted to come to this world and live. For all we could know, you could have been born a prawn, swimming freely in the ocean. Yet, you are here, as a human being. You could have given up, you could have thrown in the towel a long time ago. But you didn't.

So the fact that you are still here, living, breathing and surviving. Take pride in that. You were thrown in this world and you hustled through and you know what? I'm proud of you. I'm proud that you chose to live, and not die. That alone, is an achievement.

Take pride in yourself, because it takes great courage to be you. It takes great courage to wake up in the morning, and be you. It takes great courage to experience those feelings of sadness and pain. It don't matter what you look like, or where you came from. If you don't like something in your life, change it, work hard for it, but if it doesn't work out, don't hate yourself for it.

In the end, everything will be okay. So if it's not okay, it's not the end. Hang in there, and don't give up. I don't believe you were created by chance. You were created because you were born to do great things. Your existence here, changes things. It changes the course of this world. You may not have realized it, but someone's life on this planet has changed because of you.

So go out there, and never stop being you, chasing that dream. Your dreams are suppose to live with you, and walk with you, but never to die with you. Don't take them to the grave with you.

Be loving and be caring. Don't judge another man, because everyone has a story. Villains are created, not born. If you are at the top, help someone else up. See someone in trouble? Help them. Take pride in being human and helping another, for the meaning of life is a life of meaning.

So hang in there, and sacrifice who you are today, for who you will become. You and I both know you can do this. You and I both know you want this, and you will do it, no matter the odds. If you are in pain and suffering, good. Because behind all that, is the person you want to be. 

""F.E.A.R - either you Forget Everything And Run, or you Face Everything And Rise""

Love,
The person sitting next to you tomorrow in lecture.

For those of you who don't know there are 2 types of BTC at museum, one going to BTC itself and one going to the terminal. If you get on or skip the wrong one it can be quite disastrous.

Today I was at BTC waiting for the bus back to Kent Ridge when I saw someone in a NUSSU shirt come out of the bus and inspect the bus signage from outside to make sure it changed correctly. He was also explaining the different signages to the driver and translating them, all the way back to KR.

So basically someone from NUSSU went all the way down to BTC to check on this issue! That was a really nice touch cos I didn't think they would work on something as technical as this. Someone must have complained about it, and they actually did something. I just hope he's getting paid for this."
60156,"I am not sure if my observations are legit or am I being too paranoid or over sensitive in this matter. I’m posting here to seek some genuine advice. (Please. No troll) 

Why is 80% of everyone else living a more fulfilling life than I am? That places me in the bottom 20% percentile. I’m not asking to outshine anyone, I average I happy already. I jus want to be “normal”.

Observation 1: 
 I have never done any shopping sprees where I buy so much until my hands are filled with shopping bags, and my bed is never filled with shopping hauls. Never. 80% of everyone else post MASSIVE shopping hauls online. Some even buy so much until the bed fill to the brim with clothes. Like, how? 

Yeah, if u shop at cheap places it’s like $5-$20 per item of clothing, but if you buy around 40 items, that adds up to a $200 spree? Errrr...how come everyone is able to go on this kind of $200 sprees? 

I saw, with my very own eyes, how my average-family girl pal managed to buy so much during shopping that even her suitcase could not close. It’s just.....so full. How? 

 how do normal people just....spend this much until whole hand filled with shopping bags? I never know what a massive shopping spree feels like. 

Observation 2:  
Not only is my wallet and shopping spree (and wardrobe) not full, my heart isn’t full either. I never laugh at jokes, I never laugh at funny things, I pretend to nod and smile just to be polite. I try to appear as if I am amused. I am not, deep inside. 

I envy those who laugh like crazy all the time. There’s nothing remotely funny about ANYTHING that ANYONE says or does. The laughter just doesn’t...flow out. There’s nothing inside. 

Observation 3: 
Not only do I never laugh, I hardly cry buckets either. I’ve seen normal people cry into tissue after tissue, some even filling the whole floor with used tissue when they cry. Some cry at touching movies until their eyes become swollen the next day. Some tear up at wedding proposals because they are overwhelmed by the love. 

Many showcase hose pipe-like tear ducts where tears flow non-stop after a breakup. Their tears, their feelings, just naturally flow so much. 

Why can’t I be the same? I never cry at anything. Nothing matters to me. I always wish one day I can feel so much that the tears naturally flow out (maybe during a movie?) but my insides are so empty. 

You see, NOTHING flows out because my life is coloured by one shade of grey called EMPTY. Money doesn’t flow out naturally during shopping sprees, laughter doesn’t flow out during funny things, and my tears never flow so much. (In fact, hardly?) 

How come I always get the short end of the stick? Am I being paranoid or......?

Recently, I wanted to sign up for the Orbital program. Then I found out that registration started at 4pm and ended at 8.30pm. Perhaps the coordinator is inexperienced in organising events or is inexperience in disseminating information. But alas, most people who are unable to attend a talk for which had limited seating do not know the registration deadline. In fact, I wanted to sign up at around 9.30pm which we can all agree is a good timing, usually early in fact for most events. 

I have known not very many event organisers who hold a registration in such a matter, in such blitz. It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day. Perhaps, he does not have an event to look up to such as your school of computing camps which has a long deadline for registration. Perhaps, he knows not that 4 hours of registration is not enough.

Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part. You should not have promoted it so that you can further limit the places available. 

Lets not talk about the event organiser’s inadequacies. It is not his fault. We should learn from bad examples. Once in a while such things happen.

60140,"Is anyone else getting annoyed by the constant spam emails from Department of Psychology asking for volunteers to do their research study? Seriously, I've gotten five of these emails in two weeks. And there doesn't seem to be a way to unsubscribe from them either, or to remove yourself from their mailing list because it's not under NUS groups. The cherry on top is that I'm not even from FASS - I'm in Engin, and my friends in Science/Biz have gotten them too! Does anyone know how to stop these emails?"

My girlfriend recently graduated from University, 10 months and counting into a quite decently paid job she felt unappreciated ,and a sense of hindrance from learning, with no progression in her current role in IT sales compared to her newly joined peers. She is by no means entitled or strawberry, but the cognitive dissonance from trying to bring value to work and dreading to work is making her down. NUSWhispers, what would you advice? Thanks"

60128,"It's the second half of the semester and I see people putting in so much effort into their projects. For some reason, it stirred my competitive spirit, but I don't know whether should I act on it. Because I know if I were to try that hard, people are definitely to going to rage quit upon seeing my end product. And I am also definitely going to wreck the bell curve so hard which is bad for them."
60125,"I have been thinking about this for a really long time. I don't know if I should break up with my girlfriend. She always nags at me non stop and it really bothers me. She flosses her teeth twice a day and always nags at me to floss, when I told her flossing is a feminine thing she got really upset and pissed off like wtf? Have you even ever heard of men flossing? Other than dentists la but that's cause of their job. There was an instance where we were out with friends and we all split the bill, I discreetly asked her to lend me her credit card so I could pay and not look bad because I didn't have money. She didn't want to and just paid for me nd her share. Do you know how embarrassing it was for me? That night we got into an argument and she told me to get a job if I didn't want this to happen. She doesn't even understand that I'm waiting for the best job opportunity.

Whenever she shower, I will check her phone and I've seen her conversation with friends where they told her to find a better boyfriend. she just replied with ""haha no la"". She didn't even defend me??? She didn't even type some of my pros. 

Another thing is I've tried to ask her to resign because I don't think it's nice for her to be better than me. She should let me have a job first and my position should be higher than hers. If not I will look inferior to her. She was also really upset and I feel like she is not sensitive to my feelings at all.

I've asked her many times if we should get married or do bto but she has kept saying ""never mind la take it slow"" and I feel like she's not serious about us. I've already been so nice to her by waiting for her to marry me and honestly I could get tons of other girls if I wanted. She's so ungrateful and I feel like I should just break with her. Because I'm nice and we've been together for four years I will ask for her hand in marriage one last time. 

Maybe yall can advise me on what to do and why she's trying to make me look like a useless boyfriend. Thks in advance."

60121,"Seeking for some advice/opinions from seniors who have graduated or those who have found a job.

I will be graduating this semester and have received a few job offers.
A common thing about these companies is, they mentioned that there will be a 1-year probation period, which is in the form of a 1-year contract. 

Is such scenarios common? Do these companies actually intend to convert those who perform well to full-time employees or are they using this technique so that they can hire new employees and prevent paying the 13-month bonus, certain benefits which only full-time employees are given (e.g. medical insurance)?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

60119,"So Orbital sign ups closed in 5 hours yesterday. Not gonna lie, I was very annoyed, and it was not because of the huge interest.

First there was the technical issue, which lasted from 4pm when the sign ups opened, all the way till almost 6pm. The website was basically inaccessible at that point in time. Then at the same time, there were caching issues which showed students who were able to load the site that the sign ups were closed even when it was open. 

Secondly, on the same day, from 6pm to 8pm, majority of the CS students had a CS2100 paper. This basically means that there was a two hour period where this group didn't have a chance to sign up. After the paper ended, we almost immediately got notified that the sign ups were closed. That isn't even close to fair is it, when basically half of SoC don't even get a chance at all to sign up.

Considering that this is something that only first years get the chance to do, I have a huge issue with how the sign ups were handled."

I appreciate the efforts, sentiments and dedication invested to maintain something as high-demand and possibly large-scale as this, but I think there are room for improvements.

Still though, whether I get accepted or not, huge shout-out to thank all the people who are managing this!"
60113,"To the group of people who congregates daily at tables directly outside the reading room of PGP house, I have a confession to make.

May I pretty please request that you keep down your volume? The reading room is not soundproof and we can hear you clearly from the inside. It doesn't help when we are studying for midterms and all we hear is yuan de ** **** ** all the time. Also to the some that are singing, this is not a platform to practice busking.

Also, you are denying an angel from studying there by making alot of noise, disturbing her.

TLDR:
1. Go somewhere else if you want to talk loudly and don't disturb people around/in the reading room 
2. Angel please study there more ????"

60110,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong...i'm the sort who is excluded from social activities and groups all my life, and people never tell me why. 

Recently, I got interested in something niche, and there's a whole social network and community around it. I'm not uncomfortable saying what it is, but people always say it is inclusive and community-like. 

But then I met the girl in charge of all of it, I found out she has academia aspirations (like me), so I was really excited and tried to discuss it with her. Since then, she seems to dislike me. I don't know if she sees me as competition-- she's way way more accomplished and popular than me. 

It's really just small things- she gives her insta to some people, I didnt hear so I ask her for it, and she just gives me a ""you're so weird"" look and walks away. Whenever I talk during a discussion, she stares at me blankly without nodding and doesn't reply, but she adopts a much kinder and gentler tone with others. When she said she's adding everyone to a telegram group, I leave my username and she doesnt add me. When I sign up to help with something, it doesn't go through, and I email her to ask if I have been rejected, and she doesn't reply. 

Is she ostracising me, or am I being paranoid? It really saddens me that I seem to be excluded from that  community, because it means a lot to me, but she's in charge of almost all of it at the level of uni students, she's really everywhere..."
60109,"I recently knew someone during tutorial but we are not very close. He is from a different faculty and year.

60105,"Hi, I'm the poster of confession #60105, the one who was jealous of my best friend. I thought I should update you guys on what happened. So I told her about my feelings of jealousy (over telegram), and she cut off contact with me. I was sad, but also a little relieved.

But a few days later, she messaged me to meet up in person. I wanted to apologise for what I said, and to get some closure for our friendship of nearly 7 years if it couldn't be fixed, so I agreed to meet. At the meeting, she dropped a bombshell on me: she had been having romantic feelings for me for years.

I was shocked, but it did explain a lot of things: why she chose to hang out with me so often instead of her many other friends, her constant string of 'boyfriends' who never lasted more than 1-2 months. And yes, I was a little creeped out too.

Anyway, she asked me to go out with her. I was doubtful, but seeing as my dating prospects with guys are zero anyway I agreed to it even though I never considered being anything other than straight. We went on a few dates, and they were great. I never had the feeling of being loved by someone else before, but we clicked even better as partners than as friends. We talked for a long time about my feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, especially as it might affect us being in a romantic relationship, and I think I've gotten over it. We're going out for our two-month anniversary tomorrow, but this wouldn't have been possible without you guys on NUSWhispers telling me to tell her. So thanks for the advice!"
60102,"#60102 - happiness is subjective, i can't claim to know what makes you happy, or if they're ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""socially trendy to have"". However, i date say that your understanding of the average person around you is superficial at best.

The person thinking about BTO? he might be chasing it because it makes him happy to spend time with his wife in a place they can call their own.

The person thinking about pay? he might be a huge gaming nerd who blows dollars on his gaming rig and vidya (that's me). 

The person who wants a car? he might derive his happiness from long quiet drives, or frequent road trips up north (further than jb)

The person who sells his soul to his employer might be doing so because the job is fun, challenging, meaningful.

The people worrying about wedding costs / great vacations might be materialistic,, who are we to judge if that makes them happy. 

The rest of the faceless people you think have no soul? they might be dancers, part time volunteers, artists, Han culture enthusiasts, amateur home chefs or semi pro gamers. You don't see it because you don't look hard enough.

Projecting your own version of happiness on people and calling them boring because their only source of fun is that one vacation a year shows how much you understand your peers. It also reflects poorly on you.

If you want to get to know a person, look at who they choose to spend their time with. If you feel like you're surrounded with boring people, consider the possibility that your own personality is the one that's keeping you from meeting the cool ones. Don't just talk to people, understand them.Peace out


#60259: ""bla bla bla life sucks in singapore and girls are either arrogant or meek also they don't ask me on dates"" - you dont get to meet the cool people and attend house parties because you're genuinely uninteresting as a person, grow up and stop feeling entitled to chicken soup for the whiny soul™ that you obviously made 0 effort to reach for...

Also, if you truly believe that professors are mediocre because they don't know more than that 1 subject that they dedicated their entire lives to understand, i also believe that uni education is wasted on you."
60101,"I thought the CS2100 midterm was handled very well. A question with too many errors was voided and the setter apologised and said it won't happen again. No fixing significant errors halfway during the test! Aside from this, 2100 has been a really pleasant mod to take. Well-taught, things are uploaded well before time, expectations are clear and transparent with no hidden surprises. "

During one of my final papers, I got to sat beside my eye candy.

After the paper, I saw her chatting with this guy while we were still sitting. I didn't know whether it was her boyfriend or simply a male friend.

It didn't matter. I eavesdropped on their conversation while keeping eye contact on my eye candy.  I also nodded occasionally to drop hint that I was eavesdropping.

After I reached home, I found her Facebook and complimented her on her beauty through Facebook message. She blocked me from Facebook afterward

I then found for her Instagram, so I continued complimenting her beauty through Instagram direct message despite knowing that that would only cause history to repeat itself.

I was blocked from her Facebook and Instagram, but it was worth the try.

Sometime, you just got to be thick skin. It is better to try and not leave any regret."
