But then I realise I'm actually worth nothing to you. I'm replacable. I'm just like a fridge. You only come to me when you need me. Why am I still here ? 

You ghost me. You leave me on read. You tell me you forget to reply. I tell myself to stop being clingy, needy or paranoid. But 6 months of such antics, am I thinking too much ? Or are you the problem ?"

56867,"#56855 I don't get why a close friend would be creeped out by a personal letter to acknowledge the friendship you two share and to express your appreciation for her being in your life. I think loving someone means being able and willing to accept each other's love languages and accommodating to each other's needs and preferences. Maybe she has other reasons for not talking to you... 

Say, if a 'close friend' of mine didn't talk to me on account of being creeped out by a personal note like that...then maybe it means we don't vibe at the same frequency, and I would take some time to seriously consider why I even view her as a close friend...enough to make that kind of emotional effort..lol. It is definitely 'extra' if it's a regular acquaintance. Regular mah...so not entitled to additional 'extra' sentiment/effort/care on your part.

Sticking up for you just because we seem to be the same kind, I'm a rather sentimental person and write those type of notes to close friends from time to time, and even to colleagues I have come to love, respect and admire when I leave the workplace. You do you OP!"

56846,"hi, y3 double major in engineering and business here. im graduating in 1 semester and i have only one regret. there is this genius chiobu girl that I've been hearing about since y1; apparently if you study with her your CAP confirm 5.0 all the way. she was exactly my type, cute face, big eyes, long brunette hair, super outgoing, extremely popular. unfortunately i have a fear of women stemming from childhood and this has basically caused me to avoid her from the first time i saw her in y1. in year 1 she tried to talk to me 5 times, at BIZ canteen, UTown Starbucks, FASS canteen, in the lift at Science, even on the Circle Line MRT. however I just couldn't get over my fear of girls in general. in year 2 she tried 3 times; once when she saw me studying at central library, and another two times when our eyes crossed at Changi Airport. i just don't know why I'm such a coward and avoided her even then. in year 3 she simply doesn't even look at me anymore, even though I don't really care that she doesn't. if any guys out there want to try their luck anyway, her initials are S.U."

56839,"I wonder, 
night and day,
if you have the slightest clue 
how I feel. 

Every time you sit next to me,
butterflies, and the tiniest ray
of hope,
because there are other options.
Better, more sensible options.
 
And every time you look at me,
and I look back,
you don't just look away,
not anymore,
and I think I see it in your eyes
when you hold my gaze.

And we can talk for hours 
when hanging out,
alone or with friends,
so I thought 
we might have something special,
something rare,
for I've never been so comfortable
with someone I've known so little.

But people see what they wanna see.
If you really cared the same way,
you would have shown some interest,
some real initiative of your own.
I am tired of texting first.
You too can ask me about my day,
and not just in passing when running into me... 

So while waiting
for your wonderfly brilliant,
but dense head
to pick up the hint,
I realise, 
it would seem,
that the only dense one here
who needs to take a hint,
is me.

56838,"I'm a female and a male friend (A) of mine doesn't really have many male friends in general, rather lack thereof. Initially, I didn't put much thought to it because it could've been A's personal preference for making more female friends. However, the longer I've known him, the more A comes off really bitchy - unsure if sometimes he's intentionally bitchy or just his tone of speech. I told my close friend, B, about A, who said that guys probably didn't like A, hence they just shunned him and girls most of the time wouldn't reject talking to guys like A. This thus results in A having more female friends than male friends. What do you guys think? Is A just weird or it's his personal preference in making more female friends? "
