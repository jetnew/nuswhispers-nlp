53899,i failed all my mid terms even tho i studied so hard for them. y1 here. how can i do well or just pass the module in finals?
53898,"Do you have moments when you have a crush on someone you do not interact with at all? For the past few weeks, I have been noticing a guy with red earphone walking between E4 to E2A. Although he passed by me quite a few times, I could not find the courage to approach him. It will be very awkward to just stop him in the middle of nowhere. Has anyone been in this situation before? "
53891,"After more than 3 years of being single from my last relationship, I finally start to like a guy. He has been my friend for past 2 years and we have been on talking terms. Just that recently I kind of want to see him more and more and keep looking forward to his text and meeting him from time to time.

Knowing him, I highly doubt he likes me. In fact, no one knows if he ever had a girlfriend before - therefore, I'm really unable to see what is ""his type"" of girl or how he is like when he is in love. 

I'm someone who is afraid of rejection and therefore don't even dare to show him that I like him. I did kind of buy a gift for him when I travel but I always make it sound like ""nah, you're not the only one who receives present"" so he won't feel weird like he is the only one getting presents. Sometimes our mutual friends do make fun of me and him since we are both single and a lot think that we suit each other, I always admit jokingly like ""ya I agree"" but no one, including him, takes my answer seriously because I'm always joking around..

Okay. not looking for a solution, just wanna share this because I did not seriously share this secret with anyone irl yet and I probably wouldnt dare to..."
53890,"I have this friend that I met from orientation, and now we have mods in common this sem. ( we r both gals). I would like to get close to her as a friend, being same major as me, but whenever we go lectures or for any other events she always asks other friends(including guys/girls) to join in as well. I feel awk cos I don’t know those people so well, and I feel like she doesn’t really make me feel included as a friend. Is this friend still worth sticking around with?"
53889,"I'm going to be taking pharmacy as a major next year when I matriculate. Should I bother learning how to code? I understand many people say that it's beneficial to learn how to code and I really want to do other things like perhaps an internship/part-time job or just go travelling before my term starts. Should I still bother learning how to code, other than the ability to boost my resume? "
53888,"#53888: first, the idea that modern wars will be fought not by men with rifles but rather machines, network, precision-guided munitions, etc ... is a rather old idea. It was called ""revolution in military affairs"" (RMA). Soon after, we found out that there was a ""counter-revolution"". Indeed, if you look at wars after 1945, they all followed a common pattern. Somehow they all, except for Gulf War 1.0 1991, ended with boots on the ground, infantry with rifles going in personally. This is true for Israel-Lebanon war, Gulf War 2.0, Afghanistan (the most recent, ongoing one), and will likely to be so.

The reasoning is very simple: RMA idea is surveillance technologies will become so good that anything that can be spotted will be firepower mouse clicked away. Of course your enemy is very impolite and they will try to avoid getting killed. Thermal imaging with million dollars drones in Afghanistan was defeated by ... Talibans draping blankets over their bodies, but I digress. The problem with RMA's idea is if you don't show up to the battlefield and present a target for them to shoot at, why should they? They disperse, go into hiding, then ambush a convoy of soft-skin wheeled trucks that roll down the road, plant roadside bombs, bomb the restaurant your officers go to for lunch, assassinate the officers when they pop down to the local brother, etc ... All wars have descended and regressed to infantry on infantry with rifles on rifles.

The idea of a scholar-officer is a rather British method of recruiting officers. You find a overly educated chaps with bloodlust, slap on them some nice uniforms, give them a pistol (to threaten executions of insubordinate privates), then push them to the front. The company and below commanders' primary jobs are to stand up straight and lead the men into fire. If they get killed, they did their job. On the other hand, the British army is a professional and rather well-trained volunteer army with a decent non-commissioned officers who are well-versed at the tactical fightings. The upper echelons of the British commands are also generally good officers with good leadership skills though their tactical, operational skills maybe below that of the best. So the idea of a scholar-general is not a bad one; though remember that generals have a ""last-war-itis"": they try to fight the current war like last war. Note that big wars used to occur once every 2-3 generations or so and the changes in technologies and tactics meant that the soldiers will have to pay for the mistakes in the first period of the war. The point of my post was to point out that there is nothing glamourous or macho about being a conscript; they are all meat for the meat grinder anyway. However, the knowledge that generals and officers being so far away from danger, coddled in security and comfort have a deleterious effect on morale. It manifested occasionally by the privates lashing out at the officers by ""fragging""; or killing of one's superior. Good generals have to have a balance. A compromise approach is to have a charismatic, courageous general the likes of Montgomery, Patton, or MacArthur to be the face of the command (while being less than stellar), and to have another actually competent Chief of Staff who do the actual cold-blooded calculations and planning.

The cold-blooded calculation goes something like. OK, the enemy has one Division occupying a 5km front. We want that sector. So we'll concentrate 5 Divisions on that 5km front and breakthrough. However, we need to confuse the enemy of the real axis of advance, so we'll need to tell a few poor divisions over there to attack on a 20km front. They will likely be slaughtered in the face of numerically equal but dug-in troops, but it's a necessary sacrifice to win (a paraphrased plan of Operation Bagration, 1944). Here is the point where you need a charismatic officer/general to tell the poor divisions to attack wholeheartedly and suffer the casualties.

Brad Pitt's War Machine is a thinly-veiled fictionalisation of the service of General McChrystal in Afghanistan. For a very good overview of how battalion and below commanders really work, I'll recommend the book Generation Kill by Evan Wright, which documented the action of 1st Recon Marine battalion in Iraq. The book was adapted into the HBO series: Generation Kill. The officers in there are colourful people: one good platoon commander, an aggressive but somewhat dimwitted sister platoon commander (Captain America), a more dimwitted company commander nicknamed Encino Man (a caveman-thawed-out-in-modern-day fictional character), an ultra-aggressive battalion commander who is a cancer survivor and seemingly intended to get everyone killed so he can get medals. The problem with the majority of them seem to be that the unit was a stealthy, recon unit with scholarly commanders who typically stayed behind the line and analyse the intel, but suddenly thrown into a blitzkrieg type of combat. The officers adjusted slowly and the men had nothing but contempt for them. The ""good"" platoon commander put out his own book: One Bullet Away by Nathaniel Fick.

In general, the defense of Singapore, few publications available on it as it is, is rather sound. Singapore has an arms manufacture company: ST Kinetics, and a few Defense Research organisations. They are good ways to channel tax money into developing new technologies (the easiest way to convince the public to throw money at uncertain research projects is by telling them ""it's for defense""). ST Kinetics is producing all the important weapons for modern wars: rifles, mortars, artillery, and light tracked vehicles (given that all wars descended to infantry combat).

All HDBs appear to have hardened shelters: casualties in a bombardment rise significantly if the civilians have to scramble from their homes looking for public shelters. Now if the occupants of HDBs stop shoving miscellaneous crap into that shelter (or taking off the heavy steel door) and start putting food, water, radio, battery, stove, fuel, etc ... that will be excellent. There are impressive saber-rattlings by the Singapore Air Force. I remember reading the SAF bragging somewhere that everyday they take off from an airbase with the aircraft nose pointed at Malaysia; after taking off, the aircraft all took a sharp hard turn to avoid entering Malaysian airspace, showing readiness and skills. A lazy general will simply tell the pilots take off with the nose pointing at the sea. An effect counter-saber-rattling by the Malaysian in Johor will be to tell the anti-air radar to switch on the targeting radar and ""paint"" the SAF jets, which will be detected by the Radar Warner. However, seeing that the Malaysian Defense Radar somehow missed a very big, very slow, non-stealthy, or electronic counter-measuring MH370, I'm not surprised if they could not do it."

First of all, it was never my intention to be mean towards foreign students. I know and can empathize with how hard it is to leave your country and to study alone in a foreign country. I wrote the post to understand and find out why there is such a disparity in proportion of locals and foreign talents. Only to find out that other nationalities pursuing PHD have it harder than locals as they need to clock in more TA hours. (Which we never be aware of, if not for the comments) 

And tbh, we are jealous of most of the foreign students' stellar CAP. (Apologies for the rant) 

But I guess discrimination will always exist? 
Tbh, you should have already known about this, so you can't blame us too (Just imagine us going to university in your country, taking over places that 'should be for the locals' like brilliant, talented yourselves. Bet you would feel indignant too and we would probably experience many times more of discrimination if we were to study there) 
But I guess you would never experience this because brilliant, talented Singaporeans like us would never go to study in your country (Brilliant, talented Singaporeans care too much about prestige and reputation to settle for anything insignificant) 

Just as we put ourselves in your shoes, do put yourself in other peoples shoes too, so don't blame others.

53885,"To those upset over the straw ban, here are some tips:

1) just drink without a straw, you wouldn't use a straw in a restaurant so you don't need one here
2) buy a reusable cup and straw, keep it in your bag and rinse it after use. If you're carrying books/laptop around it's minimal extra weight. This reduces waste cups as well
3) buy 1000 straws and throw them in the sea, which will persuade NUS to cancel the campaign while killing a few sea turtles in the process

Seriously it's not difficult, we can all do our bit to help the environment! This is our future, we can fix it one step at a time :)"

Story 3: this is something that still embitters me to this day. When I was working in Singapore in a shockingly average research job for a shockingly average salary, I rented a room in an HDB owned by a Muslim Indonesian family of three. The husband was a worker in Jurong West food court; salary was somewhere in the 1000-1500 range, according to similar job postings. The wife was a housewife with a bad pair of legs and not so good mobility. The only child was a secondary school student. The child was probably on some sort of financial aid (I saw a sticker for such service). Another I noted was their very late dinner/family time. Food Court workers in Singapore go home very late (the food courts open until quite late). The family dinner quite often included leftovers the husband brought back, as a result, the family had late dinners (~12pm). Think about this for a second, the child was in secondary school; when do secondary schools starts? How much quality sleep could she got? She probably made up for this by early evening naps (I notice she sleeping in the living room couch, which I passed by going to my room).

What embittered me was what happened shortly before my departure from Singapore. When I left, I cleaned the room spotlessly and nothing was broken. The landlord checked the room and agreed to pay me back the deposit (one month of rent). He, however, cited difficulties in getting the money: “I have 200 dollars in my bank account”. He did noted that I was flying off and to this day, he did not pay me back the deposit. I still have the agreement he signed and if I have time, I can definitely get it through Small Claims Court. However, doing this will cost me more than that paltry deposit.

During the time of my departure, there was an effort to slow down hiring of foreigners for middle-class type jobs, mostly due to Singaporean middle-class types decently vocal complaints. I have no problems with them doing that; it’s their countries and their political systems. I spoke to the Executive Director of my Institute and he confirmed the situation that A*STAR was prioritising my kind of jobs to Singaporeans. Nevertheless, he assured me that there were enough leeway to keep someone like me around. I’m not sure how much of that policy helped middle-class Singaporeans; research institutes live and die on public funding and my institute was on a dry spell of funding cuts (30-50% cuts in a 4 years period). However, I realized that the policy hurt the poorest the quickest and they reap the least benefit. Let me explain: the family had a three bedrooms flat, which is by no means poor by most cities' standards; they rented out 2 and the three of them piled up in the Master bedroom, which had bunk beds and such. Also think for a moment the kind of privacy a married couple need and how hard that will be since children are always home. This family was by no mean a rarity. Let me list a few other family situations in HDB rooms I rented:

-	Young, recently married, and childless couple in spanking 3 bedrooms new apartment. The husband was a Singapore Air Force mechanic (Iron Rice Bowl kind of job) and  the wife worked as unpaid, volunteer (probably) residential “advisor” of some sort in NTU. Rented out all 3 rooms and they live in a makeshift, cordoned off section in the rather spacious living room built out of glass panes and curtains. The occupants of the bedrooms: a student couple, me, and a contract researchers couple (for one of the Bio Contract Research company) from the Philippines.

-	Indian family of 4: working husband, housewife, overboard university student son (found his diary in my room), and secondary school daughter in 3 bedrooms apartment. Again, all piled up in one bedroom and rented out the other 2. Renters are myself and a Chinese foreign student couple.

The problem of middle-class foreigners like me leaving Singapore is in the short run, the income of those families are cut by 30-50%. The two rooms were rented out to me and another foreign software engineer. I stayed there for 2 years, after one year, the other guy left and the room was not rented out to the day I left a year later. Possibly was due to the decreased flow of foreign workers. That room was ~300-400/month.

All the families I rented from all have decent flats, but they are married couples with children who had to sacrifice their privacy and marriage life to have the same income as I did (or a bit less); feeding a family of 3-4 and paying off the mortgage. The ""extra"" middle-class type job left opened by someone like me, does not help them at all; it's unlikely that any of them are qualified for such job. Statistically speaking, the girl from that family is unlikely to get into the same University that I did (though the standards may slide in the next few years). The deposit that was scammed off me represented about 4% extra monthly rent for my stay there. Thinking about it now, them getting a few hundreds extra bucks did not get them any richer, nor did our relative financial standings change significantly."
53880,"Regarding the i reject campaign, the vocal minority has voiced their displeasure. I feel that however strawless campaign has benefited me a lot of ways. 

Over the past 3 months, i stopped using straw, even at MacDonalds (although MacDonalds still provide them)
I am bringing KFC habits to other fast food restaurant.

On a more serious note, Nothing is too small. 1 straw is just the beginning. 
As we go on go with our lives, we should reduce wastage (food, electricity, materials, books). Bring your own containers if possible. Take public transport. 

If we cant even bear the inconvenience of 1 straw, how can we expect companies to change, who are we to expect countries abide with Kyoto Protocol. 

Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. In this era overpopulation and over consumption, Singapore being a developed country consume resources disproportional to its population. And you will realize compared to an average human, we do place a large burden on the environment. 

ONE straw is just a start. A small gesture of your commitment to reduce pollution and global warming.

We want an ocean of less plastic. We want a world with fewer natural hurricanes/tropical storms. We want a world without crop failures. We want a future where our children has a chance of living. 

And that straw is the bare minimum you could do. "
53879,"Why must coffee be self service? Take your own cup, put your own ice, coffee, sugar... it is such a pain. After a tiring day, can’t students just get an ice coffee normally? And I gotta drink my ice coffee with no straw as well. And NUS should spend some money upgrading its basic facilities. Deck is so old and dull. "
53878,"To the OP of #53843: You are an embarrassment to all of us. Yes we get that you are frustrated with the blanket ban on plastic straws. But your immature action of buying 1000 straws and throwing them in dustbins is pointless. You need to understand that the accelerator of the movement really came from the sea turtle that got a straw stuck up its nose. Because of that, we are experiencing a blanket ban on all straws so that a small percentage of them do not accidentally leak out into the ocean and kill more sea turtles. You know what I would do? Instead of being a childish prick, I would dump 1000 straws into the ocean. Not only will this offset the movement but it will double down on the stupid straw ban. Maybe 1 million straws were used and 100 leaked out into the ocean. Now less straws are used but yet 1000 leaked out into the ocean. “Environmentalists” : 0. The rest of the world: 1"

53863,"(Disclaimer: did not expect it to be so long.. so well)

Hello #53863! Just want to say, dont put yourself down like that. I too lost all my JC friends after JC, entered army and made a lot good friends there, so I can relate to that front part of your story. In fact your story reminds me so much of myself back in my JC-army-Y1 days.

However I would like to say that making friends in Uni is a totally different ballgame from NS unit days. In NS, everyone is going through the same thing together at relatively the same pace. Its easy to relate to one another, and hence make friends. You guys also live together(or even work office hours together for non-combat soldiers) 5 days a week, and in NS its generally better/advantageous to work well together with your unit mates. Hence under such conditions, friendship actually comes rather naturally, and even if it dont come in 1week, you still have the next week, next month, in fact 2 years.

Now Uni is totally different. Everyone has different commitments, everyone leads their life at a different pace, there is also not a need to work together. To make things ""worst"" you only have like perhaps 1-4hours of interaction per week from either tut/lec/cca. If you dont capitalize on that short amount of time to talk to people and try to know more people, you will find that time pass by so fast, 1 sem is over and you know no one. Next sem comes, you see new people again. 

In my y1 days i was in a similar situation as you, I wish people would just open up to me, and i was afraid to open up to others because I did not think i was worthy of anything. I was a quiet person throughout my sec sch to jc to army. However I soon come to realise that by waiting for someone to open up to me, that will be like gambling and hoping I get lucky to meet such a person. 

Year 2 came, and from that year on all the way to y4 I decided to just try to talk to anyone beside me in tutorial or lecture who I find interesting. I would say the number of times i felt like i embarrassed myself was so many I cannot count. However this should not stop you! Take it as like a learning process. Its easy to say ""I am quiet thats why i have problems making friends"". Identifying that is good, but you have to work on it too! I promise you it gets easier as you ""practice"" more and more. It doesnt matter even if you made no friends eventually, what is important is you have learned to open up and be comfortable initiating conversations, and this my friend will go a long way.

If you dont take the first step to try, you will never learn. Dont think about how others will judge you, everyone is in fact too busy thinking about themselves anyway to judge you. But one important thing to remember and live by is ""No one owes you anything"", talking to someone does not mean he will be willing to be your friend. But it doesnt matter, KEEP TRYING. 

Love yourself! When you stop putting yourself down all the time, you will become more comfortable opening up to others. When you think you are not worth others time, of course you will fear interacting with them.

Just take it as a learning process when it comes to interacting with strangers in Uni, leave friendship to fate. But one thing i know for sure is: If you dont try even fate cant help you.

53862,"#53862 Don't be mean to foreign students okay? Without foreign PhD students, lets see what rank NUS will hold.
Going through undergrad, master and PhD in NUS, I am sick of all kind of discriminating comments, which seems to never stop. You see us as TAs because the Singaporean PhDs are not required to do as many hours. They comfortably sit in lab doing research whereas we struggle with you and your non-stop complaints, sometimes about things that are beyond our control. Heard that PhD students are cheap labors? :D
We have lower stipend than the Singaporean PhD students. We face the unsaid, unwritten discrimination from you guys. And you are not right that we are given priority. There were profs whose first interview question was not why I wanted to do a PhD under him but if I was a Singaporean citizen or PR.
You think we foreign PhD students have an enjoyable life? You think things come too easily for us? Haha. Don't know about others but I have gone through suicidal thoughts, not only once.
If you want to do a PhD, go ahead and tell your department. I am sure they will be more than happy to take a brilliant, talented Singaporean like you. But as far as I know, brilliant, talented Singaporeans prefer to do PhD in the US.
If I can say something to the ppl who always say that foreign students take their opportunities etc. You never know what privilleges you have. You are just too busy complaining to grab the opportunities, so don't blame others."
53857,"To post #53857,

I like how you did all the calculations for the military strategy. But my post is slightly off topic from your main focus.

I want to talk about the idea on having scholars in the army. I am not a SAF scholar, but I don't like it when people say that scholars make lousy generals. From what I see in places like ST's fb comment section, many people assume that those with the rank of LTC and above take up arms and charge towards the enemy like recruits in BMT. 

Like what OP 53857 mentioned, military tactics involve a lot of calculations and strategy when you're at the top. I believe the movie War Machine with Brad Pitt as a 4-star general shows the REAL work of the upper management in military during conflicts. It's a lot of policy making, strategy and politics (in it's true sense, not office politics)

53848,"Aside from the 1000-Straw Warrior, I get some of the valid points raised by those who don’t take well to the iReject campaign and hope to offer my views in response.

Going straw free is undeniably inconvenient and I agree with #53848 that they really add up and can make a bad day suck more. But I see it no different from stuff like taking a detour because of finding out that there’s construction on your usual route. Over time, we’ll adapt – walk another way, bring our own bottles etc. Once we come to expect it, we won’t be thrown off any more. I think calling the initiative draconian is an exaggeration. It seems like in Singapore, convenience is perceived as a human right, not a privilege and I believe this mindset has contributed to much of the backlash.

Some also suggested developing alternatives to straws. Given that researchers manage to produce a comparable, biodegradable, disposable alternative with their scientific sorcery (they probably have), consumers will still have to do their part – give them a rinse and dispose of them separately, so they don’t get mixed up with all the food waste and be incinerated with the rest of the trash. It takes two hands to clap. If people simply avoid straws/other plastics, nothing has to be done at all.

And of course, ideally, people would find the good in their hearts to be eco-friendly and we can slowly promote the culture without ‘forcing’ it on them. But most of us are too caught up with life to make eco-resolutions and stick to them despite being concerned and so could do with the push. And, as many uni students can relate, we procrastinate even for things of direct personal benefit, what more environment stuff? However, as studies have proven time and again, the environmental crisis is pressing. If “slowing down global destruction” was due at 2359, we’re probably at 2300hrs. I think too much is at stake for us to blindly hope for divine intervention or technological revolution. We can’t s/u Mother Earth yall.

Also, to agree that helping the environment should be encouraged in principle while refusing to give up even the smallest little luxuries or conveniences is just a politically correct but vacuous statement IMO. It’s like wanting to have your cake and eat it too. I’m not saying this to pagro at people who use straws but contribute in other ways. Rather, I’m referring to those who are expecting change with absolutely zero compromises or work on their part.

I think it’s perfectly fine to be pissed for a bit and offer constructive criticism about the implementation of the campaign (like having more education). It’s still in its teething stages and I think the initiative should be applauded. I’m glad that there is some healthy debate going on but the blind hate and angry tirades need to stop.

53843,"To the OP of #53843: You are an embarrassment to all of us. Yes we get that you are frustrated with the blanket ban on plastic straws. But your immature action of buying 1000 straws and throwing them in dustbins is pointless. You need to understand that the accelerator of the movement really came from the sea turtle that got a straw stuck up its nose. Because of that, we are experiencing a blanket ban on all straws so that a small percentage of them do not accidentally leak out into the ocean and kill more sea turtles. You know what I would do? Instead of being a childish prick, I would dump 1000 straws into the ocean. Not only will this offset the movement but it will double down on the stupid straw ban. Maybe 1 million straws were used and 100 leaked out into the ocean. Now less straws are used but yet 1000 leaked out into the ocean. “Environmentalists” : 0. The rest of the world: 1"

53830,"Honestly this blanket ban on straws is so stupid. The big players don't care about saving the environment. They only care about saving face and costs.

Yes, I am angsty, I've been greatly inconvenienced. I have super sensitive front teeth so I need straws. Ok lor suck thumb drink water.

But seriously, this surprise policy was so poorly executed. I only found out that there were no straws after I bought my drink. Many people who bought drinks were also shocked and surprised that there were no straws. At the Deck, it's irks me how they use the same straw to poke through the plastic seals of all the different drinks so that we can drink from it. Why not ban plastic seals too???

You know what they could have done? Slowly phase it out, and then at the end of the time period, give welfare packs that have metal straws, cutlery sets or something, instead of the snacks. (Healthy living plus no more waste from snack packaging?!) With the costs you saved, you put it in student welfare, and shows that you care about students and the environment, rather than ""ban straws liao pat back not our problem anymore""."

53804,"Ok this started as a simple inconvenience, but I'm really starting to wonder what the people deciding on changes in NUS is thinking. Not entirely sure they are related but really the inconvenience is adding up and I don't know who or where I can voice my concerns to.

So how did this start? With my ice kopi. I've come to enjoy my simple pleasure of getting a cup of ice kopi, the top sealed with plastic and a colourful straw to sip it from. Today, I did not have that pleasure. I received the same ice kopi, same plastic cup, but a different cover for my drink. A plastic one, similar to those you find at any fast food restaurant. BUT there were no straws. This, according to a tiny sign available at the stall, was due to the iReject Campaign to reduce waste.

Now I don't want people thinking that I don't support environmental conservation, I do. I think it's great that the school is trying to help the environment. At the same time, there are certain inconveniences that happen when you try to change things overnight. Like for example, this unhappy post on NUSWhispers. Personally, I dislike drinking my ice kopi straight from the top, the ice melts and dilutes the flavour. It's also caused me a bit of grief in that it still spills despite the cover. I'm sure a lot of people will be talking about how I should suck it up for the greater good, but the thing is, minor inconveniences like these add up.

So hopefully, now I have your attention with the ice kopi story. Let's now talk about one of the first things that bothered me. Those new to the school probably don't know this, but the internet used to be far more stable. Around 2-3 semesters ago, my Wi-Fi connected automatically. Essentially, the school was a second home to me. The network was smooth, I could do my work or even play games on the network. IT. WAS. WONDERFUL. Not to say it didn't have disruptions now and again, but overall it was stable.


Now, the Wi-Fi fails frequently and constantly requires me to retype my NUSNet ID and password. Even after entering it successfully (I made my password visible so I can ensure it was correct) multiple times, I still fail to connect. If you've ever rushed a deadline, you'll know how important it is to have a good internet connection. As I recall, this only began happening once the school decided to switch from 1 NUS Network to multiple sub-networks (NUS_STU etc.). Sure maybe I don't need to have internet access all the time, I should go enjoy nature, or talk to someone, maybe over a meal?

Turns out, even having a meal could be an issue if the Campus had truly gone cashless! E-Payment uses the internet (that should be obvious, but just in case I'll state it). Now if you have a data plan, that may be a slight nuisance but you can still pay, but if for whatever reason both the school Wi-Fi and your data do not work... Guess you'll starve? Now you probably think what are the odds of that happening? Well given the frequency that the school Wi-Fi doesn't work, in addition to freak accidents (like a fire at Singtel), I'd say the chances are very likely.

So maybe I am being overly angsty, but could whoever is rolling out these initiatives at least TEST THEM OUT first? Or at very least, transition a little more gradually? Even a feedback box is fine, rather than saying ""this is your life now, deal with it.""

Lastly, if any NUSSU members are reading this, I voted for the current committee, I hope you could help me voice these concerns to the school, as was promised in your campaign."

53802,"I always hear or see people asking if its still possible to score an A after getting 25th or median percentile for midterms.

Assuming your midterm weighs less than 30% of your entire grade.

You gotta estimate if your midterm score differs far from the 75th percentile. If you think that you are only 1 or 2% away from 75th percentile, then definitely you are able to get A for finals. Lets say you score 16/20 and got 25th percentile. If that test weighs 20%, you have only lost 4% of your grade.

In my experience, if you get 90% or even 85% for your entire grade, chances are you are an A. Of cos lets not talk about those easy modules whereby people score close to full marks to get an A.

Even if you score 10/20 and lost 10% of your grade for midterm, if you work hard and get close to full marks for finals, you are still able to secure ~90% of the grade.

Moral: its definitely possible to get A for the mod even flunking midterms. Maybe not A+. Is it hard to score well for finals? Yes. Is it possible to score well for finals? Yes. Why? You still have half of a semester to do something about it. "
