60498,"Please help me. I'm at a loss. My girlfriend does not stay in hall but I do. However, most of the time I am not in hall except during the night. Hence, I duplicated a set of key and gave it my girlfriend, so she can at least study in my room while I am out. My friends told me that she have been letting some dude into my room occasionally, and I questioned her but she denies it every time. I trusted her. One day, I hid in my wardrobe and told my girlfriend I left for the gym. An hour passed and she brought a dude (her faulty mate) into the room. I was disgusted, but I told myself maybe it was just a project meeting. They became intimate and started kissing. I could not bear to see this any longer and came out of the wardrobe. I took my macbook which was on the table and smashed it on the dude's face and shouted at them to leave. Now I am a loss on what to do with my macbook. Can someone please advice where I can repair my macbook cheaply and if the warranty covers this damage? Thanks."

60491,"Hi #60440, I've got a similar problem to you, but kinda different.

My boyfriend's fine, we've been dating about 2 years too. He's not very good looking, and I don't know if I'm okay with it, but that's not the biggest problem. The real problem is actually quite small, really.

Thing is, he tries hard to maintain the idea that he's good at sex, but he's not all that good. He's had maybe quite a bit of experience, but he just doesn't make the cut. He just doesn't know how to please a lady I guess.

To make things worse for him, his little brother is really quite small. I read somewhere that the Singapore average is about 4.5? He's definitely not near that length, though he tries hard to. He says it's the lower body fats concealing it, but honestly, he's not fat. He's literally got almost no fat.

So well... to quote your question, recently I have been re-questioning my feelings for him because I feel like he's not attractive enough. He's ""shorter"" than the average guy, and doesn't have killer looks nor body. I feel selfish thinking this way, but I can't help it. Should I leave him?

60487,"Hi NUSWhisperers, I have a problem. 

I like my friend beyond friendship level, but I can't progress with the relationship cos she's attached. I honestly think that she's not really into her current relationship and she had mentioned that I'm an easier person to talk to as compared to her boyfriend. 

I'm conflicted between being nice to her while waiting for her current r/s to die out, and distancing myself with her by cutting off my friendship with her. It hurts me to do either of these because 1) I wouldn't want other people to misunderstand that she's a twotimer and 2) its really emotionally taxing on me to see her with her boyfriend, thinking it could have been me. Please offer some advices."

60478,"Please be nice as you read this, thank you. I’m a 25yo female. I’ve always been brought up by my mom only. My biological father passed away before I was even born. Then I had a step father throughout my childhood years but was under the impression that he was my real father until I was older. However, this step father eventually left my life too. And he wasn’t very significant in my life after a while because we stayed separately. And as a child I’ve always been afraid of him and have a fear towards him. In my late teens to current adult life, my mother has a partner. Whom she told me; he’s the best amongst them all, my step father and my biological father. However as we all know, all good things come to an end. He passed away due to an illness last year. Ever since then, my mother has been very lost. She does everything a curious teenage girl would. Texting and calling other men while reminiscing the one she love who is gone. She is a perfect mother, don’t get me wrong. She brought me up really well. She would sacrifice anything for me and I know I’m the first in her life no matter what. Not all these men. However, I feel uncomfortable. I know she has to find her happiness somehow and somebody to grow old with her since she’s only barely half a century old. I do encourage her to do that cos I know I’ll have to get married sometime in life and can’t be with her all the time. But I can’t help feeling uncomfortable. And having this distant feeling with her and thinking that she’s strange and not the mother whom I used to know before I reached adulthood. Maybe, it’s because I haven’t been growing up in an environment with a proper father so I’m not used to seeing her being affectionate with men. I did not see that irl, it was the phone calls; way of speech and looking at her use her phone to text. I get really sad sometimes feeling that I can’t get back the mother I knew when growing up. She has her own life to live, I know that. That’s why I really need advise on how I should think about this. More importantly, just last night. By accident, I found out that she actually has an adult toy. My perfect mother all these while actually has an adult toy. I was in complete shock. Many scenarios played in my head which I wish she wouldn’t do. After composing myself, I realised that she after all is a human being. And have her needs. But I wish she wouldn’t do it in front of the men or something. Maybe she needed it because he passed on. And after serious thoughts I didn’t mind if it was an alone activity. Just not on video calls with men. Maybe y’all wouldn’t understand why I’m shocked by that. Being a single child and brought up by a single mom, my mom is all that I have all my life. She is basically my life. We only have each other. I can’t explain the bond between us anymore explicitly, but I hope you get me. Knowing that my mom has that toy, and calling men etc has really made me feel disappointed, sad, confused, strange and I don’t know what to do. Since last night until now when I see her, I think about the toy. When she talk to me, I feel distant. I see her differently now and I hate that I can’t help it. I really don’t want to feel this way. I didn’t tell her about it. I wanted to tell my bf and close friends about it but I felt that it’s my mom’s privacy so I’m keeping it to myself. But it’s making me die on the inside. What should I do? 

Your kind advice will be deeply appreciated, thank you. "

60445,"Help. This has been bothering me for so long and I don't know where to seek help. 

I grew up being close to my dad but we grew distant after my sisters were born. He would start hitting me in secondary school whenever I was rude to him and that caused us to drift even further. Fast forward to JC where I was sitting on the sofa one day(in a loose pants till mid thigh), I caught my father, who was sitting on the floor, trying to tilt his head forward to look through the gap of my pants. I gave him the benefit of doubt and did not think much into it. I would also revise till late night in that period and would end up sleeping on the chair in my room/ sitting on the bed, but would always wake up lying on the bed with the lights off. I felt uncomfortable about it, and confronted my father one day in the presence of the rest of my family. He denied it, and the rest of the family also said that they didn't do it. The thing is, I have no history of sleep walking, so I couldn't be the one switching off the lights and I have also tried to sleep sitting on my bed, and woke up in the same posture the next day. Also, I know from young that my father would sometimes come out of the room at night to use the bathroom/cover blankets for me. What hurt me the most was that had he admit that he was the one who switched off the lights and helped me in getting a more comfortable position to sleep, I would have taken it as a gesture done out of care and concern. But he denied it, and if he had nothing to hide, why would he? Me not being convinced and his denial led to frequent fights, and during one of those fights, he told me, ""I'm already in my middle age, I have a wife and children, and there are also so many other girls in the streets, why do you think I would want to look to you?"" That got me thinking that, maybe he is right, and I want to believe that someone so related in blood to me would not cause me so much hurt and pain. But similar instances involving the lights still happens. This was before university started. From then on, I would also stop myself from looking at him whenever I am in shorts so that I wouldn't second guess what he is staring at. I wanted to trust him so much as my father. 

Now, half way into uni, the feeling is back again. One time, I caught him tilting his head slightly to the right, looking at my shorts when he was standing beside the door as I unlocked it. There was another instance where I was walking to the living room in fbt, and he was sitting on the floor. He was asking if I was going to have my dinner, but his eyes (which were at eye level of my shorts) never left my fbt. These are just a few instances of what I experienced. I always told myself that as my father, supposedly my role model, and someone that I should respect and look up to, I want to believe him that he will never do this to his own daughter. But I really can't deceive myself anymore. I constantly feel uneasy at home, and was stressed whenever I need to pass by the living room to go to school when I am in shorts, even when they are all of decent lengths. I feel that I'm living with a tikopek at home, instead of a supposedly loving figure, and I would sometimes have a loss of appetite over it. Given the student loan I have, I don't think I have the financial means to live on my own. Is there any way I can seek legal help, or help of any other forms? Somebody please help me."

I cannot really help you with that, I would recommend to feedback to the bus operators to ask them to request making more handlebars to help provide more support. 

I do believe that it is a matter of the suspension, as well as how your drivers drive, along with the winding terrain you have around, which results in you rolling about. Just look up the underneath of the bus. They're supported by balloons or something, when cars are typically supported by springs.


Though, I'd say this: your handlebars are made of this:

OD 32 x 1.6 mm SS Tubes (looks and sounds like SS 304), with a centreline radius of around R = 127mm.

The process is draw-bending for the one at the front, and roll-bending for the ones you hold onto in the middle of the bus. 

You can sort of tell from measuring them. A quick google search, a vernier caliper and a few more tools could get that for you.

Sorry for the late reply, have been busy battling the bell curve.

I completely agree with you that the only reason Pharmacy and Nursing are curved is their ""traditional judgement"" of how these courses are Science courses. While this answer is politically correct, it vastly differs from the pragmatic approach our education system usually takes. 

As we all know, the bell curve is a prospective assignment of the normal distribution to grades, i.e. a cohort is expected to fare in an expected spread of grades. However, courses like Pharmacy and Nursing are heavily ""regimented"" in a fixed curriculum such that there is a fixed set of knowledge and skillset that every nurse or pharmacist is expected to possess in order to be competent in their roles. The implication of the bell curve is that students become more competitive over every single detail (to the point of unnecessity to fulfil job requirements) such that grades bear no significant meaning other than how exam-ready one is. Employers are as such given the liberty to be more selective of ""better"" students, and students who are not so exam smart but probably extremely capable at work are deprived of an opportunity to be employed. Hence my true question is, ""given the limitations of an educational institute to assess students' job performance, is this (the bell curve) really the best way to differentiate students?""

Also, I do agree that a pharm/nursing student need not see being a registered pharmacist or nurse as a be-all-end-all goal. There are certainly other opportunities to explore. Be that as it may, that does not mean that doctors are receiving the short-end of the stick. Similarly, many do not even stick to the major they read after graduating. Dr M is one such example. Regardless, Pharmacy has come up with a new Pharmaceutical Science major. I believe it's clear that Pharmacy was intended to be clinically-driven."
