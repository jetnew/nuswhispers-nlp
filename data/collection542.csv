54299,"As an exchange student from Europe coming to NUS, there are many great things about studying here - the competitive nature, the amazing food and the good weather all year round. 

There are some really annoying things about the way people conduct themselves, though. 

Firstly, a majority of people (not all) walk incredibly slow, and do not seem to be aware of their surroundings. If someone is approaching from in front of you, and you and your friends are taking up the entire width of the pavement, then you need to make space. 

Holding doors open. I’ve noticed quite a few people not holding the door open for the person behind them. On a few occasions I’ve had the door slam in my face despite someone only being half a metre ahead of me. Come on, it doesn’t take any time to keep the door open for the person behind you. 

Another post from last night alluded to people not taking their bags off on buses. A few responses claimed not to understand the fuss stating that the same area is taken up on the bus. That is not the point, the point is that you have less control/awareness of a bag on your back. If you hold it in front of you then you’ll be able to be a little more courteous to fellow passengers. 

Singapore is an amazing place. I am grateful for getting the opportunity to study here. These are just a few of the daily inconveniences I face as an exchange student. "
54298,"To the poly and jc kids things, I'm someone who works with both poly and jc kids as part of my job for past 5 years in non academic setting but still in university setting. My key observation is that JC kids seems to be those ""law by law"" kind while poly kids are not - not in a bad way, some tend to be creative to find solution.

When I see both poly and jc kids working, I enjoy it when I see them bringing out the best of each other and bring their experience to table openly, without bothering where they came from (some came through ITE route too!) . 

There's no such thing as who is smarter or not because everyone is still trying to reach the ultimate objectives and goals they have set. 

Jc kids who didn't go through Poly education doesn't mean they suck at doing projects, it's just their education system didn't have much of that opportunities. Same for the opposite, poly kids who didn't go through JC education system doesnt mean they can't write well because they dont do GP, it's their education system that focuses on something else. All these are applicable to anyone and everyone who comes from different education path. It is up to an individual to take these as transferable skills and apply it to different situations, and more importantly share these important skills with your fellow friends and project mates since all of you are now in the same education system.  

Therefore, instead of feeling like ""all JC kids are like this"" or ""all poly kids are like this"", you should focus on that individual who made you feel that way, communicate with him or her in order to work out the difference you guys have. 

Cheers to all!! "

54292,"#54261: Well, there are multiple steps for me.

First is the realisation and me forcing myself to see the reality that the porn industry treat people (its actresses) like shit. Everytime I watch one of those, I send a signal to the market that this is the thing that interest people and they should continue to make porn like it. My action is but a drop in a bucket but I want to keep my conscience clear.

The second thing I did is I found out am less interested in the actual sex depicted in porn, but rather the story of people, that occasionally involve sex. Thus, I seek out ""less harmful to the actors and actresses type of porn"". Meaning amateurs. I wish to think/believe that those porns, while being lower in production quality, represent someone's real sex lives where sex is a natural part of their daily lives. 

The third thing is: don't just watch porn. Watch something with a plot which happens to have sex in it, and try to analyse the story. I took a couple of mods in film study and have been applying it to even the most mundane stuff I watch. If you are afraid of porn numbing your brains: get your brain active while watching porn by looking for plots with porn (not porns with plot).

The best source for such, for me, is Japanese hentai manga. It does the trick for me: highly arousing, occasionally have great, heart warming stories, ""victimless"" (one lone crazy nutter drawing all the stuff), support creative endeavours (wait ... I am a pirate; OK, appreciate creative endeavors), filling-in-the-blanks-for-series-with-disappointing endings. Then there are super sad hentai manga that make you give you depression (the most confused arousal time possible). For example: Metamorphosis/Emergence/177013.

Switch it up. Manga is great. Including the porn variety.

Caveat: I do all of this while being attached (previously) or married (now), so I have a steady, stable sex life and am satisfied sexually, for the most part. The hentai stuff is for me to connect with the weirder possible desires that simply cannot get in my sex life. There are so many good things in my married life that I don't want to trade for potentially crazy sex so hentai is an discovery trip."
54288,"I've this crush on a classmate from my GES this sem. He's not in my tutorial group, only my lecture, and I've been watching him throughout this sem and gathering the courage to ask him out.

He seemed to always just disappear into thin air after the lecture ended, which is strange since he sits in front of the class and always wears this black jacket so he kind of stands out if he moves, so I haven't had a chance to ask him out.

But I've recently just found out that he's attached and I'm crushed...

His girlfriend is so much better than me, she's attractive and athletic, I'm pretty sure smarter than me since she's from a better JC than I am, and even her figure is so much better? Like, she's got some really large assets... Kind of jealous on that point since I'm pretty much a runway.

54280,"My SO is quitting smoking and it’s been three months since he had his last stick. The past few days, I could see he is becoming more irritable at stuffs especially towards me. Before, it led to fights and arguments but since we both figured it must have been symptoms, I tried to hold back. I know it’s difficult for him and I’m really proud of how far he has gone. I want to be emotionally stable for him. But as someone who recently just got out of counselling, I barely started becoming emotionally stable. I’m trying my best not to take what he says to heart but it’s difficult. I’m trying to just be there for him and not mirror back his emotions. Sometimes I want to cave into my hole and just want to be alone but I don’t want to do that to him. 

I want to rant about work or school, how his symptoms is affecting me but I don’t want to agitate him further. So I just hold it back and cry it off to sleep. He’s a great guy and past few weeks, he wasn’t showing these but lately it’s getting pretty often. Being emotionally stable right now especially with stress looming in, I don’t know how long I can take it before I break down again. But I think this time, I won’t do it in front of him. Right now, I feel he needs me to be stronger for him and I’ll try to be."

In contrast, I feel that my JC peers tends to be more selfish by focusing on their individual work and ignoring the group projects. AND. Who says they're good at writing reports.

54268,"The amount of entitlement from the people against the straw ban is amusing. Just because someone supports the straw ban doesn't mean that they have to become shamans or hermits and go 100% green or risk being called a hypocrite otherwise. Since when was environmental consciousness a 100% yes/no concept? 

Indeed the whole sensationalism and fixation on straws is partly due to the turtle images which can be attributed to improper disposal, but if you can't be bothered to put in that little bit of effort to use less straws, what makes you think you'll be willing to cut back on the more severe things that harm the environment? Right, because ""I'm just one person, it doesn't make a difference"", and ""other countries pollute more so it doesn't matter anyway"", and definitely not because you are lazy, apathetic and can't live with less convenience.

Sure, this whole straw ban isn't going to do much to reduce waste directly, but it forces you to think about what is going on, and quite evidently has highlighted the apathy people have here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This upset me as I am quite a blur person and am puzzled why he get angry at trivial matters. My friends would have explained to me if I misunderstood something and we will just laugh it off.  But for him, he will think that I am testing his patience. 

From the start, he say he want to find a gf that can go dutch on dates and I agreed. Statistically, out of the 10 dates we went, I paid for the bill 7 times. He sometimes cancel the planned date as he felt tired, and meets me only when he feels like it. This makes me dishearten and I really hope that he do love me despite his actions.

Your accusations are baseless and unrepresentative of the student population who came from poly. 
The issues you faced in group work is actually pretty common, and these students are definitely not all from poly. Rather than whining over in NUSWhispers, go and do your work lah.

54241,"Am a person on the fence, but I think almost everybody can agree that the ireject campaign has been handled badly - the transition was abrupt, very little effort was put into justifying the change or even in communicating about it, and as a result, quite a bit of the response towards it has been quite negative. People against the ban are correct in pointing out that not using straws probably won't have a significant impact on the environment (not even on a personal level, when comparing straws to other things like driving). The real question is whether the ireject campaign (and similar ones) can lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour which might then have a clear and significant impact on the environment- for example, phasing out plastics entirely in the future, or at least reducing waste by a significant amount.

To that question, I don't think there's a clear answer yet; research tends to find conflicting results: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014001599 - you can access this through lib.nus if you feel so inclined) There is a possibility that these campaigns will lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour, but it might also have the adverse effect  (make you feel like you've done your good deed for the day for the environment, so you can afford to be a bit more wasteful later). And, of course, this will also impact the way that future campaigns are received. 

What I don't think is controversial at all is that there are definitely things that everybody should do to reduce their impact on the environment- and that those things go beyond not using straws. 

If you are happy to let go of plastic straws, that's great! But being smug and self-righteous about it may actually turn people away from being environmentally friendly (look at #54203 for example - just terrible). If you think that the ireject campaign was poorly executed, I agree completely - the NUS administration should at least do more in terms of communication and dialogue before embarking on such a large scale ban. And if you'd rather not deal with the inconvenience of letting go of something that doesn't make that much of an impact, that's fine too - but put your money where your mouth is and do other things that you believe will have a greater impact on reducing your personal environmental costs - try to eat less meat, use public transport more, buy less things in general, recycle more, etc - and don't stop there!"

If the thought of looking after kids is so repulsive to you, won't it be the same even if you have a kid though adoption/surrogacy? All the sacrifices you will have to make still applies although he is not your own flesh and blood.

I have been happily attached to my girl for quite a long time.Basically I have done alot for her. 

I gave up my further studies in the States , broke up with my cliche of male friends(Those Eat Drink Make Merry kind), fell out with my loved ones, all was done for her.

I do not expect her to return my favour because I have always thought sacrifices are inevitable to maintain a good relationship with your SO. 

However the day came when I was hit with the cold hard truth. I caught her cheating on me while reading her text message. It was a conversation with some foreign guy. She has been exchanging lovey dovey texts with that scum. Not just that, she has also been planning to cheat me of my money via the joint account I had with her. That moment was really a bolt out of the blue.

To my bros out there, do not be over desperate for a girlfriend. You never know when she can become a timebomb. Do not let a girl become your weakness. Focus on your relationship with your family instead and work on personal goals. Do not give up what you have achieved.

here's some advice from one gay girl to another. the most obvious thing will be: does she have rainbow accessories? moving on from that, you might wanna see how she acts, if she's flagging (google it if you gotta!), if her clothes are on a list of 'top 20 clothes women wear that men hate', and lastly, if none of it works, pull out the big guns and flirt with her or ask her yourself. maybe get her number and work up to coming out to her on bringing up lgbt topics/issues and see what she says. you got this! and if it doesnt work out, don't worry but maybe you wanna check out the girls in other faculties as well?

54208,"I do indeed like you, for a while with our interactions I thought it was mutual. 

I really want to tell you how I feel. But I fear that you will leave if it's just a misunderstanding on my part, I would rather we stay as mere friends than contemplate losing you. 

Or have I already started to lose you since we have gotten more and more distant

Perhaps I gave off the vibe that I was not interested or that we are just friends. 

I miss our small talks about random stuff and your life. 

It hurts when I see you doing what we used to do with others. I hope you find someone who has the guts to tell you how they feel about you instead of distancing themselves like me and wallow in self pity

If the thought of looking after kids is so repulsive to you, won't it be the same even if you have a kid though adoption/surrogacy? All the sacrifices you will have to make still applies although he is not your own flesh and blood.

If you are not able to change your own mindset on this issue, please do not agree to have kids as you may regret this decision in the future. 

I am also someone who cringes at the thought of having kids. There are so many friends around me that are so excited about having their own families in the future till sometimes I wonder if there is something wrong with me. I tried to see things from another pov, but I know that I will really hate myself if I have a kid just because its a norm. I can't wrap my mind around the thought of waking up to crying babies, putting my career on hold for a bit or having less freedom to pursue my hobbies/travel as and when I like (+the cost of raising another person). So I am choosing to stick to my views (my body my say). For my case, I brought up this issue with my other half early on in the rs and thankfully, he sided with me. We are married now.

I hope you and your boyfriend can figure this out.

54206,"Its the time of month where I have to peer review my teammates in a certain engineering project, I have this certain teammate whom i feel has always made actions that are super sketchy (like trying to exaggerate certain elements of the project and whatever he is doing, he malingers about his availability so as to avoid project meetings, boot licking professors) and i tried to keep an open mind about this certain teammate even though I have heard rumors that this certain teammate will create a lot of problems for me where my friends have told me how cancerous this certain individual will be in projects and will always try to put himself in the light so as to stand out from others. 

For the past few weeks, its been super hard on me as his actions made it super clear that he actually created numerous possible worrying problems till the point that I actually felt so depressed (I had depression before that and I did not take any medication to curb this mental illness) that i had suicidal thoughts as I was worried that the project would not be completed in time due to the lack of participation from my teammate and felt the need to see a psychiatrist. 

How should i go about grading this certain individual and should I send an email to the professor regarding this situation? Thank you to those who have been around me and cheering me up in this time of darkness."
54205,"#54309: My reaction to #54205 and its comments are quite different though. Many seem quite insistent that girls should be allowed to wear what they want, which must be right of course - it's their bodies; some (if not many) guys like to look; the girls know it; they're happy to flaunt; I don't see the problem.

My question is why guys do not have such freedom in dressing, and will those (especially the women) who are adamantly saying ""let her wear what she wants"", similarly defend a guy walking around in briefs?

Our society now seems to be such that girls can walk around in shorts that, as the OP put it, are little more than underwear - which is great from a straight guy's point of view, of course XD but can you imagine what would happen if a guy tried to do the same? Methinks he'd be lucky not to spend the night in a lockup. If we are happy to assume that a girl dresses like that ""for herself and not for anyone else"", why can't a guy walk around similarly skimpily clothed just because he feels like it? How many of you defending the girl's freedom would similarly tell those who are ""offended"" by a guy walking around in briefs to ""just look elsewhere""?

On a broader point, women in this society have so much freedom to dress as lightly or as provocatively as they want, which I repeat is great. But men are stuck with the same boring and warm clothing regardless of the weather and the wearer's mood. A woman who dresses like a man for business purposes is called confident but a man who dons women's clothing is ridiculed and told to ""man up"". What does this tell you about how we subconsciously view the relative status of the two genders, even if we froth at the mouth with politically-correct statements?

As a guy who used to live alone, I have worn dresses and robes and they are seriously more breezy and comfy than the boring old trousers that every boy grows up with no alternative to. This doesn't make me want to be a woman - I'm perfectly happy with my assigned gender but I just feel if you want to talk about women's freedom to ""wear whatever they want"" and not be a hypocrite, then make sure you genuinely defend men's freedom to walk around in what they want as well. Even if it's a translucent dress with briefs underneath."
54204,"Anyone else face this problem? Every weekend I come back from school, I plan to study but I just can’t stop sleeping... I’m so tired, I come home I can sleep the whole friday away, and then half of saturday, and after that, I STILL feel tired. 

Is this normal? and then after sleeping, I feel extremely terrible about myself... Like I’ve wasted time. I hate myself for this. "
54203,"Am a person on the fence, but I think almost everybody can agree that the ireject campaign has been handled badly - the transition was abrupt, very little effort was put into justifying the change or even in communicating about it, and as a result, quite a bit of the response towards it has been quite negative. People against the ban are correct in pointing out that not using straws probably won't have a significant impact on the environment (not even on a personal level, when comparing straws to other things like driving). The real question is whether the ireject campaign (and similar ones) can lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour which might then have a clear and significant impact on the environment- for example, phasing out plastics entirely in the future, or at least reducing waste by a significant amount.

To that question, I don't think there's a clear answer yet; research tends to find conflicting results: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014001599 - you can access this through lib.nus if you feel so inclined) There is a possibility that these campaigns will lead to more environmentally-conscious behaviour, but it might also have the adverse effect  (make you feel like you've done your good deed for the day for the environment, so you can afford to be a bit more wasteful later). And, of course, this will also impact the way that future campaigns are received. 

What I don't think is controversial at all is that there are definitely things that everybody should do to reduce their impact on the environment- and that those things go beyond not using straws. 

If you are happy to let go of plastic straws, that's great! But being smug and self-righteous about it may actually turn people away from being environmentally friendly (look at #54203 for example - just terrible). If you think that the ireject campaign was poorly executed, I agree completely - the NUS administration should at least do more in terms of communication and dialogue before embarking on such a large scale ban. And if you'd rather not deal with the inconvenience of letting go of something that doesn't make that much of an impact, that's fine too - but put your money where your mouth is and do other things that you believe will have a greater impact on reducing your personal environmental costs - try to eat less meat, use public transport more, buy less things in general, recycle more, etc - and don't stop there!"
54202,"I noticed that there are sweets near the counter at the biz library, it's a really nice gesture and the sweets help me stay awake, but I'm wonder if there is a budget for it or if it comes out of pocket from the staff? No disrespect meant, but replenishing the sweets adds up and I'm not sure if it's fair if the library staff are always paying for it"
54201,"I feel really lost and like my life is at a dead end. I'm not suicidal per se in the sense that I actively want to die, but I don't actively want to live either. 

My parents just got into another massive argument again. This isn't anything new, I've been used to it my whole life as long as I can remember. The difference now is that I have no 'safe/happy place' anymore.

From primary school till JC I loved the schools I was in and had friends and even teachers I could talk to to take my mind off the problems at home. I loved my classes and CCAs and would spend as much as possible in school before going home, and that generally helped me forget, at least for a little while, the hell I had waiting for me back at home. 

But that's not the case anymore. Don't get me wrong, I know I am very fortunate and privileged to have gotten into the course I am in- everyone always tells me that. Only problem is I hate it. My parents very kindly took a break from their incessant fighting to 'persuade' (read: force) me to enter my course because of the 'prestige' of the course (and NUS in general) and that it has good career prospects in the future. My passion is actually for a less conventionally prestigious course offered in one of the other local unis (they have sub-specialisations not offered in NUS), but my parents scoffed in my face when I told them. 

So now I'm not just living in an unhappy home but also in an unhappy school environment I'm stuck in for a few more years. There's nowhere I can go to have a peace of mind, and since most of my friends from grade school are busy in other courses/unis, I have nobody to turn to either.

From other posts I've read here, it seems the UHC counselling isn't much help and I can't go to a private one because my parents control my money (even the little I've earned from part-time work/internships because they claim I'm not 21 yet so still a minor who shouldn't be given the responsibility) so I'm really helpless. Like I said, I don't actively want to kill myself, but if I get T-boned by a container truck or just don't wake up one morning, I wouldn't complain..."
