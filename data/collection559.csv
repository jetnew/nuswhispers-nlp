I think I am kinda in a similar situation as you. I am interested in a girl who is very friendly towards me, and I was trying to advance a bit, asking her out for lunch. But I checked with another friend that she is alrd attached, and thus I decided to completely back out. Also she sounds disinterested in the beginning so I just moved on.

It is hard for me to suggest what to do if you still have strong feelings for him/her, but I think it is better to do a bit of soul-searching, if this relationship is really worth it, and (if you and the other person are alrd friends) if forcing it across will backfire and sour your friendship.

"
55982,"I’m the poster of #55982 and #55063 condemning girls having fwb. I’m disappointed with the comments yet again (albeit some are reasonable points and I’m addressing them below). Please don’t comment if you don’t have a point to make and all you do is name calling and giving sinister remarks (eg. One post just comment “TLDR”. Seriously? What an useful comment, trying to attract attention?) I’m here to advise girls on self love, moral value and chastity. There’s an urgent need to fix our tattered moral fabrics. 

Sorry I’m gonna ignore all the useless comments and address a few key issues that surfaced:

1. Stop mentioning about causing harm! John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism and principle of harm is an absurd moral framework don’t you see it? Let me enlighten you: eg. Let’s say cheating with another man when you are married is morally wrong (if you don’t even agree with this, then you are really morally incorrigible). However, what if you are so good at cheating such that your husband can never find out? According to your harm principle logic, the act will miraculously become moral because there will only be harm if you get found out (eg. Husband feel hurt, parents feel disappointed etc). Basically, it is echoing “you can cheat as long as you don’t get caught”. It’s so superficial and absurd. Furthermore, I’m not even using utilitarian framework, why do you insist that you only ascribe to utilitarianism and ask me for harm mechanism?

2. Consequentialism is also a ridiculous framework (for goodness sake, please wiki on it if you don’t know prior to commenting, if not you will just look shallow). Why? For example, you are married and has sex with another man because he drugged you. If based on consequentialism, you are no different from a cheater because the final outcome is that you had sex with another man when you are married. It’s so absurd!! The framework failed to account for intention, ie. Good intention that lead to bad (due to bad luck etc) outcome will be deemed bad. 

3. Postmodern ethic is even more absurd. It adopts moral relativism and everything depends on context and culture. At its bare foundation, it’s basically power, linguistic game intertwined with cowardice to take a stand on moral issues. Basically, everything become subjective and opinion. Seriously? 

Some people may not grasp what I mean, I’ll elaborate a bit more clearly. Tom like strawberry ice cream and Daniel like chocolate ice cream. These are called OPINION and PREFERENCES. Postmodern ethic is basically attempting to change all rights and wrongs into subjective opinion and preferences just like how Tom can’t say Daniel is right or wrong to like chocolate ice cream (eg. Fwb is personal preference. It’s subjective whether casual sex is wrong.) Whether extramarital affair and incest is right or wrong will also become merely preference and subjective opinion. 

Can you imagine how dangerous and chaotic the world will become if everything is subjective? There will be no objective right or wrong or truth. Everybody can disagree on everything and nobody will be right or wrong because there’s no judge or benchmark. Is that what you want when you encourage people not to be judgy? Refusal to stand up against wrong vices such as fwb, and sugarcoat it into personal preference and opinion so that you won’t offend anyone is a classic example of cowardance. The society is getting too fixated on criticising judgy behavior to the point that principles and values are eroding. 

Do you all see the problem? Morality cannot be subjective and change based on context, time, or culture. If you think it will, then you have not truly grasp what morality is because you are merely talking about social norm and socially acceptability. Morality is so different from social norm for goodness sake. 

So what’s the fundamental philosophical issue here? Ans: there needs to be some form of moral GROUNDING and anchor in order to have objectivity. Virtue ethic is the grounding and anchor for human flourishing. Some comments questioned why virtue ethic is the best? Why these virtue and not others etc.. The key is: you cannot question why!! Why not? Ans: because it is the fundamental axiom. What is an axiom? Axiom is an irreducible primary. It doesn't rest upon anything in order to be valid, and it cannot be proven by any ""more basic"" premises. 

We need axiom because if not, we will run into the infinite regress problem. Eg. What is human made of - cell. What is cell made of - atoms. What is atoms made of - proton, neutron and electrons. What is proton made of - quark. What is quark made of - dark matter. What is dark matter made of? Do you see the problem? You can ask “what” infinitely and it will never end. That means there must be some irreducible primary that cannot be questioned even further and that is axiom. 

Examples of axiom are: Parallel lines can never meet. Probability can only range from 0-1. Do you question them? You don’t!! Because they are self evident and are irreducible primary!! It will be insane if you say to your math teacher these are dogma!! 

Virtue is similar to “parallel lines dont intersect and probability range from 0-1”. It is an irreducible primary axiom of moral philosophy that is self evident and cannot be questioned, but it is NOT a dogma. You cannot question the cardinal virtues because they are inherent good, ie. the essence is good and you can’t doubt that the essence of virtue is bad. You can resort to intellectual dishonesty or play verbal games by twisting virtue into bad things (eg. coining terms such as “fwb virtue” or “wisdom of murder”), that will just make you look childish. 

All right... this is not a philosophy classroom and I don’t want to bombard layman with things they can’t grasp, it will just bore them out. 

I just wanna say, I am currently attached for 2 years and neither me nor my gf have any tainted fwb history (hence I’m certainly not an incel nor some desperate horny guy). In fact, I broke up with a girl before she wanna have sex with me before marriage. 

I’m amused that a lot people are annoyed by my superior and holier-than-thou attitude. Because you know what? I don’t even see myself as superior or holier. I’m just a normal person. The fact that you feel I’m holier is because your reference point of “moral normality” is so low such that you feel I’m holier. 

Girls... please stop lowering the moral benchmark even more. If not, nude women walking on street might be the new “morality” in future. Don’t be used by men, please! "

55980,can anyone recommend a GE that's has a very low workload and MCQ finals/no finals. cheers!
55979,"#55979 Would recommend GEH1057: Materials: The Enabling Substance of Civilization.

- 2 2-hour lectures per week
- No tutorials
- No midterms
- Finals is 100% MCQ with 2-sided cheatsheet (I recently heard it was changed to open-book)
- Group project is a 10-slide powerpoint presentation on materials and their impact on human cultures, you are free to decide on the scope (no need for actual presentation, just submit the file to the lecturer.)
- Few people bid for this module compared to available quota

Bell curve is steep (100% MCQ), but if you just want to S/U, it may be the most slack GEH module you can ever find.

55978,"#55943 I'm graduating this sem. 3+ years ago, I made the decision not to go for orientation camp. Some facts:

1. I don't have cliques of friends that take classes with me. In most classes, I only recognise a few students.
2. I'm still single if that is a concern. But that would not have changed much as a CS student.
3. You can still study well without friends. If you are stuck with problems, you can ask the person beside you or just approach the professor.

To put things into perspective, even if you do go for orientation camp and know some acquaintances and probably 3-4 friends that actually stick around, it is highly inefficient to be planning the exact same classes with them all the time. Most students will be taking different classes anyway. And if you do attend same classes, you aren't supposed to be chatting away in most of the lecture.

I do not regret missing the orientation camp. Most of my interactions with people in NUS is genuine. Be it tanking group projects, asking professor's questions, or discussing actual problems/projects in my majors. These project mates could turn out to be acquaintances/friends down the road, and you will also have a better idea what kind of person he/she is. Will he/she run away during projects or is he/she a responsible person?

I would recommend focusing on personal growth in NUS instead. You will realise that friends come easily when you are good at what you do, and you will also not be as bothered by being alone anyway. "
55977,"hi. i like this guy, but i don't dare admit it. 

all our friends tease us though, and honestly, i secretly love us being shipped together. i thought maybe we could have something, because he showed some signs too. 

today he told me he wants to get back together with his ex.

dear god the pain..."
55976,"I recently found out the likely reason why NUS may not usually allow students to take leave of absence even if it is a well-grounded one. For instance, a student may want to take an internship in year 4 sem 1 and delay graduation for a sem. 
In such a situation, normally a university should grant the request, because why not? (Not to mention that NUS supports the spirit of entrepreneurship) But it appears that NUS will have to pay MOE the tuition grant that is provided by MOE to local students. Thus, whenever a student doesn't graduate on time, NUS will be losing money. (For instance, if you are a science student, the tuition fees amounts to 40000, but with tuition grant, you only pay 8000, that means the school pays back roughly 30000 to MOE, rounding up to first significance digit) Of course, in the best interest of the school, they will try their best to graduate all their students on time. 
This line of reasoning makes a lot of sense to me, so I believe it is true. Not to say that i heard the story from a rather credible source. But with the recent fake news saga, I must say, decide for yourself whether this is true or not. After all, I am just writing what I heard from others. 
This kind of things affects the interest of the students and should really be made known to us. At least it should be an open secret, if such things really exist. So is it an open secret? Do you know of real examples of students being rejected of Leave of Absence?

Part of me wishes him all the best but part of me also wish that he won’t be able to move on not because I still have feelings for him but I am so afraid to see him getting together with someone else.

55965,"Following from #55930 and #55946, what is a socially ""acceptable"" number of past sexual partners that a girl can tell her future spouse?

55964,"To the girl thinking of telling her boyfriend about her fwb with a married man. My advice is simply: Do not tell him. Not telling him does not mean that you are lying. I expect to be flamed for this but in my personal opinion, you are not obliged to share anything about your past. You can choose what you want to share and how much. Plus you ended off well with your fwb so it is highly unlikely that your fwb will blackmail you and your boyfriend would not find out unless you told him yourself.

My rationale for this is he will not see you in the same way again. Even if he accepts your past, even if he himself says that he does not mind and it will not change anything. Trust me, it will. He will still judge your moral values subconsciously even if he says he will not. Perhaps he might even bring it up when you guys argue. Perhaps he might even use this reason to call you a slut or a whore if he happens to call you names during a fight. 

Don't bring it up. Don't focus about the past and focus more on the present and on your current relationship. Nothing good comes out from airing your dirty laundry even if it is towards a potential significant other."

55954,"I am a chemical engineering Nus alumni, was reading the posts on the debate about the usefulness of a technical and non technical degree. A lot of valid points for the value of arts degrees. But I just want to ask a question, what do you hope to get out of a university education? I can only speak from my experience in engineering. I did not do well for my degree, just a pass degree. I also do not find the course contents relevant to engineering jobs that it supposed to train me for. Ultimately what differentiates you from other job applicants are the values you can provide to your employer, of course, it needs not be a technical degree. However have to admit studying a technical degree enables you to implement good ideas, and you cannot do without the execution part while generating good ideas are equally important.

Now I will divert into another topic, about how good is teaching in NUS, and whether NUS should focus on attracting research faculty to boost their rankings. Personally as a fee paying student I would go for teaching quality , and do not get me wrong, I am not advocating spoon-feeding but the ability of lecturers to impart their knowledge and expertise is important especially in the STEM fields. If they cannot impart knowledge and skills efficiently, then it defeats the purpose of paying for tuition fees, I might as well just Google for better teaching if not for the degree scroll.

In conclusion, I do understand the points both sides of the debates are coming from but the most important thing is what do you want to get out or got out of your university education? I do not regret taking up my course not because it is ""practical"" but because I developed through it a sense of self dependence, to persevere through problems on my own. I did not achieve honours but I am proud I completed the course without much ""extra resources"" in the form of passed down notes and solutions for past year papers."
55951,"Every year, university rankings pop up but I don't pay much attention because I already know what the quality of education in NUS is like (you hone your research skills by searching for the good profs).

Seeing NUS top the charts in cleaners' welfare would catch my attention. Okay now I know that our cleaners are contracted - we outsource our cleaning to cut costs. But it's an NUS office that awards tenders and pays the contractors. And this tender system has a criteria of cost-effectiveness, quality, etc. If NUS really has that great a law school and business school, it can come up with a tendering system that values protection for cleaners while not bleeding our budget. Another thing we could look into is providing good rest spaces. Our cleaners have to climb the ridiculous number of stairs in NUS, and a lot are quite old. Mopping the floor after it rains is also strenuous because they have to avoid falling. It would be good if NUS could create proper rest spaces for them. If they have to sit in the stairwells, maybe get them some nice chairs and not the broken and mouldy ones from staff offices. 

I don't really care for academic rankings. It's not going to make me #proud of NUS. But if the news pops that NUS leads in best-practices when it comes to awarding cleaning contracts and caring for its cleaners, you bet I'm going to share how proud I am to come from NUS (and get started on that class giving thing, if this is what it takes for Management to care)

55950,"Unsure where #55950 gets his confidence that #55930 is his girlfriend. On the other hand, I think #55930 is probably my girlfriend, especially after the events over the weekend.

We got attached quite recently. I also know that I am her third boyfriend. As new lovebirds in the honeymoon phase, we went for a two night staycation. Nothing out of the ordinary happened other than our first sex together (I wore protection). On the second night, things took a bizarre turn. She wanted to do the deed unprotected, but she said she needed to make a confession. A confession that she slept with a married colleague for about a year in the time between her last relationship and knowing me.

I felt crushed. And my libido went down faster than the sterling pound would on a no-deal Brexit.

She then confessed through tears that she started sleeping with him because they worked long hours together and the first night happened after some copious amounts of alcohol and persistent persuasion by him. After the first night, she continued sleeping with him because she felt an emotional connection to him, and that she felt lonely having exited a rather long relationship. She felt I should know that they had unprotected sex multiple times, even though both of them were clean as their workplace required regular HIV and blood screenings. She also further confessed that that was not her first time sleeping outside a relationship as she slept with one of her exes when they were not yet together.

I felt utterly crushed.

There was the newly found love of my life confessing her past deeds which I would have otherwise felt repulsive. Even though I am not a virgin myself, my past and only partner was my previous official girlfriend. I told her I needed some time to think and we turned in for the night on different sides of the bed.

I stayed awake, and she did too. It fell into place. She constantly mentioning her need for emotional connection when I first dated her. Her rather excellent bed skills that seem incongruent with her long spell of singlehood after her last relationship. She is frankly not the best looking girl around, but I can sort of understand why the married colleague continued returning to sleep with her, for she must have satisfied him where his partner didn't.

I still felt crushed, but the rational part of me knows that it was my ego (the number of past sexual partners) that felt crushed. 

What she did before knowing me is part of her history, and as a single at that time, she was not accountable to me. She said she stopped sleeping with him when she felt cheap and that she needed to enter into a more fulfilling relationship with someone who would spend his life together with her. She has since moved to a new workplace, and her health screenings since then have shown nothing wrong.

I felt crushed, but less crushed.

By taking a leap of faith to be fully candid with me, she hoped to put this behind her and move on properly without it being a guillotine over our relationship. As it is in the past before she knew me, the least I could do is to accept her for what she is now, and build our lives together as a new couple.

I reached out to her. She was still sobbing. I told I appreciated her honesty and want her to put all these behind her. Her sole emotional connection should be with me only, and vice versa. We made sweet love, before I cheekily asked her to serve me with her full repertoire of bed skills.

I felt crushed, but this time, it was feeling crushed by her libido. I regretted my cheeky request.

By the time the sun rose, she was snoozing away under the sheets in bliss. I stayed awake. This is merely the start of our journey. I may not like her history, but it is part of her that I will have to accept. What is more important is that we move forward together. To put it crudely, how many cave explorers she had, or whether I am the first cave explorer, is way less important than the fact that we are each other's last and only explorer from now on.

Honeybee, you may not know that I read NUSWhispers since I am not from NUS, but if #55930 is truly you, the above words are my true feelings.

Your nectar.

PS if #55930 is not my honeybee, oops. But honesty is still the best policy."

But some day she will not reply at all.. sometime 1-4 text reply only.

She told me before is not between us. But I really curious and want to know what happened to her cause it feel shitty when you can’t help or be there for her (cause I at oversea intern) 

I did ask what happened to her but she told me that when she feel like telling then she will tell.

It has been 18days already and I quite worried..

This is not a troll post... guide me please senpai! "
55938,"Hi! Anyone who took MUA1166 Music and Computing under A/P Peter Edwards can advise me? I am not a Music major with little musical background, and I am interested in taking this module next semester. I have some enquiries:

1. May I know whether this module is S/U-able?
2. If this is S/U-able, if I put in enough effort how hard is it to obtain a U (i.e. D+ or below)? I am afraid that the bell curve is destroyed by YSTCM (Music) students.

Thank you very much and have a good day! :)"

I do wanna talk to and befriend the locals but everytime I initiate a conversation, it'll just die down and end really awkwardly. Sometimes I can even feel that the locals are just not interested in talking to me once they find out that I'm from China. I really don't know what to do  :(((("
55936,"Let's admit it. - ""If you are the tze char boss, will you employ the chef or the dishwasher?"" - Episode 2

In the recent episode, Harry was not successfully re-hired again from his Tze Char Boss, Dick. Over the next few days, he went on a mass application and submission of his resume. Sooner enough, he got a reply from a vendor cleaning company. He was readily happy to strike the interview as he knew that what he is applying to is truly related to his bachelor degree. During the interview, he try his best to express how passionate he is about dish-washing and how he is able to contribute to the company. Ultimately, he is given the offer. When asked about the figures for his salary, he went on to research on the current jobs' market rate. 

Job ------ Market Salary
Dish Washer : $XYZ
Chef :   $XYZ + $Xtra

He went back to the interview the next day.

Harry : ""Hi , I am very super passionate about my job and I love it very much. I am asking for a figure $XYZ + $Xtra.""
Interview : ""Sorry, We are happy that you are passionate about the job and happy to have you with us but we are conducting a business. We can only pay you by the market rate - $XYZ.""

Harry accepted the offer. The next day, the cleaning company sent him to work at Dick's loklok stall. How ironic it is to be to be back to his old boss stall ! During the smoking break, Tom chat with Harry.

Tom : ""Eh harry, how much are you getting now?""
Harry : ""Market rate , $XYZ lor. How about you ?""
Tom :  ""I also getting market rate lor. $XYZ + $Xtra. We all taking the market rate. See la, that time I told you to apply Cooking degree. You don't listen. Now every month take lesser $Xtra money! ""
Harry : ""I have the passion for dish washing and I am very good at washing dish (lvl 99). Too bad the market rate for my field is lower.""
Tom : ""Of course lower la, your course is not a technical course that the world recognize to be at a good market rate. ""
Harry : ""Hey, stop all your technical vs non-technical logic okie! I join dish washing course because of my own reason okie! Sometimes, your reason is so ""appalling"" that I wonder are you really a university student from the way you speak.""
Tom : ""Hey if you want to debate, let us reason it out amicably. You do not need to explicitly ""Try hard"" to insult me. That shows how easily offended you are. Later you ""Angry TioLaiXiong"" then you know...""

*Both remain silence*

Harry : ""Hey, I thought Dick already hire a fresh graduate to wash dish, how come he still hire a vendor to wash the dishes?""
Tom : ""Aiya, nowadays everywhere also cut cost. I am going to have a salary increment next year. I think Dick hire the fresh graduate to replace me soon. I have to upgrade my cooking skills consistently to show my worth in his loklok stall.""

(A year passed... )

Given the same amount of time spent for Tom & Harry living in his world, Tom have 12*$Xtra more money than Harry. 

Stay tune for the next episode where Dick fire Tom and Tom join the cleaning company ! "

55930,"Girl from #55930 here. Sorry #56003, I am not your honeybee as I didn’t go staycay with my boyfriend over the weekend. Something more complicated happened.

The colleague messaged me after seeing my post to apologise for making me feel cheap. I waved it off and said it was in the past. We met up on Saturday for a meal for some innocent catchup.

During the meal, he mentioned he is now divorced after catching his ex-wife with another guy on their marital bed. Oh the irony, because we had copulated many times on that very same bed when his ex-wife was working.

After the meal, he invited me to his house for drinks. I accepted. Long story short, after many glasses of fine wine, we reconnected physically. Memories of our illicit past flowed back. Then, he was the cheater. Now, I am the cheater.

I felt guilt-wrecked after leaving his house as I made a no-sex before marriage pledge with my boyfriend. Not only have I broken that pledge, it was with the same colleague. 

That colleague has now proposed being fwbs again (he knows I am attached). 

I am conflicted. On one hand, I love my boyfriend a lot and don’t mind marrying him even though the colleague is richer, has a better body,  better looking and sexually in-sync with me. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to seem wanton by going against my no-sex pledge with my boyfriend so early (he is quite conservative) even though I have my needs. 

Should I just fwb with the colleague while technically upholding the pledge by abstaining from sex with my boyfriend? Why does life have to be so complicated?"
55929,"I am curious about this... 

How do canteen vendors on our campus make money during the vacation term? 

I notice most canteens still have to remain open during vacation period (since they still have to serve people working in the school) but the crowd is certainly much, much less compared to during the school term, when the canteens would have thousands of students to cater to everyday. 

It's kinda sad when I come to school during vacation and see the canteen so empty. Sellers will be lazing about when there's hardly anyone to cater to.

Wouldn't this have them incur immense losses? These canteen vendors could work elsewhere and probably get better revenue during this vacation period. 
Or does NUS compensate them or something? Anyone has any idea? "

55913,"Axe to grind on this email blast ""Invitation of Science Faculty Students to Medical Mission OCIP"".

In their signups, organisers just stereotyped three faculties and conveniently left out other chunks of the student population.

I'm under the FoS which explains the email and its title. However, its contents aren't looking that inclusive as initially thought.

This recruitment just made me feel very uncomfortable as I felt volunteers have just been framed as useful pieces of flesh.

P.S. PDPA requirements are also absent.  "
55910,"Now I don't want to be superficial, but it's common to hear that (relatively) good looking ppl might so called looked down and avg and below avg looking ppl. So if you do see a good looking guy or girl being friendly and nice to a new friend (not in the acquaintance sense) that is less blessed with looks, does that mean that he or she is soneone who isn't that superficial and hence isn't that particular about looks? It's a stretch to be connecting these seemingly weak links but just wanna hear about ppl's genuine opinions regarding this."

55907,"Today I chatted with an old friend from jc, randomly our topic drifted to crushes. She said she has a crush on this cca mate, while I said I have a crush on my classmate. It has been a really long time since I said that out loud. 
I have been trying to bury the feelings I have towards him in the bottom of my heart and I believed that I was successful. But today, when I said it out loud, I realized that I may still feel something towards him. I feel really stupid for feeling this way because I know nothing will happen because it has been too long. 
I cannot continue to have a crush on someone whom I did not even see for almost two years and whom I did not even keep in contact with. It is plain dumb. But somehow I cannot let go as much as I wish to. 
I hope one day I can forget him for real without forcefully trying to psycho myself... "

55905,"A big shout out to those TAs who are so willing to give their students full marks for class participation though they might be struggling in the module and don't have the guts to answer questions in class. I struggled quite a bit this semester and didn't have the confidence to answer questions in class. I am really thankful for those TAs who understand the struggles that we were going through and even took the initiative to help students by giving their contact details. Appreciate the effort a lot!!

To those TAs who are kinda stingy giving full class participation marks, just know that everyone struggles at one point of time in life. As much as some would love to participate in class, they have tried their best but their best weren't good enough. Personally, my confidence level had dropped to rock bottom until it gave me minor panic attacks in class. I know that going the extra mile is not in the job scope but it surely does make someone's day better. Or even showing concern to those who are scoring badly would suffice."

55902,"An opinion on this FASS/FOE/Other Degree Debate:

It doesn't matter what degree you take. What matters is how well you do it and your non-academic activities. By the latter, I mean what internships you go for, networking, CCAs etc. Your degree doesn't confine you to mediocrity, your attitude does. 

So stop comparing which degrees are useless, which aren't. The truth is, they're only useless if YOU waste them. Other people's opinion don't matter, why let them dictate to you whether you're in a ""lousy"" course or not? Who are THEY to decide? God?

And for all you know, the people who started this topic may not even be from FOE, they may not even be in a Uni Course, they may not even be of a mature mindset. Just mindless trolls that are becoming ubiquitous online.

You decide your own fate, no one else."
55901,"Hi all, I’m a medical student from YLLSOM (guess I’m too free that I have time to read this forum and make this post haha..) but anyways... I just want to make 1 point. And no, I’m not gonna involve involve myself into the FASS saga.. I’ll leave it to the public to decide whether med or fass is better :P

I’m more interested about doctors being replaced by AI and would like to give my 2 cent worth (probably helping some JC kids to pass med sch interview if they happen to read this post). With the advance of AI like MIT Watson, doctors seemed threatened to be replaced, or is it? It’s superficial to claim that doctor’s job is to cure patients (in fact it’s quite rare given the rise of chronic diseases). William Osler put it very nicely “to cure sometimes, to treat often and to comfort always”. The key role of doctor is to offer comfort, emphasize and give hope to patients. Scientists and drug researcher are the ones they truly cure diseases. 

Even with the rise of AI, the human touch and emotional connection will always be needed during times of vulnerability when one is sick. And doctors will never be replaced. 

Ok, back to mugging! Hope I helped some med wannabe.. YLLSOM is not hard to get in, you just need to throw out all the stereotype and superficiality and truly understand the profession. "
