62395,"Long post, just wanted to share my story. With regards to a certain post about the “bumping”, whether accident or not, I’ve been wondering to what extent the bumping should be to warrant a report? I’ve actually experienced it twice in the past - when I was much younger wearing in my school uniform going back home and I was just scared shitless and froze on the spot. The first time I tried to move away but he continued moving towards me (across the cabin, train was quite empty) and the adults around witnessed this and didn’t even say anything. I just prayed that my stop would come asap. Second time was on a crowded train, I was standing at the corner near the entrance and there was a guy in front of me. Every time the train jerked a little bit, his body would bump against mine fully, and he’ll stay on me a tad bit too long. I thought it was accident bumping but it happened so many times within the 2 stops and even though I was holding a thick file trying to push him off every time he lands on me, he still does it. I didn’t dare to speak up again because - what if it was on accident? what if it was because people were pushing him from behind? 

After reading my experiences, and assuming I reported it to police will the guys bumping against me get punished? Or let off with a warning? I was so traumatised as a kid and scared to say anything and hoping that the adults around me would say something but nobody did. If this happened again I would definitely try to call him out but should I bother reporting him to the police? "
62391,all my midterm results are very very average.. neither 25th nor 75th pct and usually one mark below/above the mean... and the module doesn't have an exam... is it still possible to get a B+ ?
62388,"#62388, I agree with you.

Apple, Google, and Netflix don’t require employees to have 4-year degrees, and this could soon become an industry norm.

62381,"I was on a public bus sitting near the window in those chairs four people sitting facing each other. 3 brown workers came on the bus and sat in the three seats around me. They were laughing and talking loudly and one guy seemed like he was glancing at my legs and one had a phone in his hand. But as i was unsure if he was looking at my legs or not, i couldnt do anything but to just place my bag down on my legs and hope for the bus to go faster. But come to think about it, am i being racist for feeling that way as im unsure if i would have felt the same level of discomfort if it was people of my own race. Maybe i would have felt the same? Am i overreacting or do i have the right to feel uncomfortable"

Clearly those two girls who eat in the Science study clusters do read NUSWhispers but instead of changing their behaviour, they have simply changed the study cluster in which they eat and chat. It really is a pity that this behaviour exists. "

I'm a girl and I have spent the past two years (and counting) liking a guy who has nothing. He doesn't have a family in Singapore, doesn't take any money from them his parents (works part time for his own money) and doesn't have a proper roof over his head (rents a different house every year).  

I love him for his honesty and his strong determination to do well in life. I love how he displays his compassion to his friends. I love how he is humble and doesn't look down on the rest of us who have lower GPA than him (he's a FCH student). 

I believe that there are many girls out there who are able to see beyond material wealth and just love the guy for who he is so please don't give up. ♡"

62373,"Hi, just wanted to ask what you guys think about helpers breaking your things? I understand that they are people too and they make mistakes, but when it happens repeatedly I feel like they should understand that there are consequences...do you think it's reasonable to make them pay for the value of the item they break?"
62367,"I'm an incoming SoC student (Computer Science) who got into UC Berkeley as well. Since I am conscious about the cost, I am planning to choose NUS over Berkeley. Does any SoC senior have any advice or opinions about this? Is an SoC education worth forfeiting an offer from a world-class school in the interest of cost?"
62362,"Hi. Once this post has gone up, if it gets picked to be posted, I think most of my friends will know who I am but oh well. Here goes.

It has something to do with careers. After graduation I held a perm job at an established healthcare organisation, but due to unforseen circumstances, I left the job 4 months later. Then I frantically searched for a new job but could not find one. So I settled on a part time contract job in customer service while searching for a full time. Fast forward 4 months later till today, my contract is up and I'm still searching for a full time position. 

The thing is, there is an organisation that seemed interested in hiring me, and I was quite relieved. Yet at that point in time my reply was that I was still going for interviews and asked if I could be given more time. Now after my contract ended, and I still couldn't find a perm job, I wrote back to the organisation to ask if the position is still available. 

Till now, I got no reply. I'm wondering if the liaising personnel is irritated by my moves or that he is just busy with other stuff or that he is on leave or mc. I was hesitant to call him these few days too. 

After discussing this with my friends, one of them told me that in the first place, my way of communicating with the HR showed that I'm hesitant about taking the job and that it's not my first choice. Then he went on to ask if I am really interested in it and can see the job align with my goals and wants. To be honest, I'm torn between 2 sides. First side is that I cannot stand being unemployed and useless around the house, though I'm taking an online course and doing something, the other side is that the job does not seem like a fit with my goals. 

I'm stuck. I really am. Should I go for goals or should I look towards the monetary side of things and earn money first? Fyi I graduated last year."

62359,"Are B-grades really considered as 'mediocre' and pathetic here? I thought I was doing pretty well with a CAP of around 4.0 with mostly B's. I literally cheered when I see I got a B+. But then I hear my friends and other students whining when they don't get A's and when they get a B-grade, they sigh about it.  

I thought my CAP is satisfactory as it is. B grades were all I ever aimed for in Asia's top university. Jeez, my family even clap for me when I am so much as able to get B+. C grades are fine too if the module is freaking hard.

And no, I don't come from a top prestigious JC so my expectations were never set high. I was just happy enough to land a spot in NUS.  Are A-grades considered the norm here? The expectations by my peers of me? I seriously don't get it.

62355,I would like to ask that if a class has less than 30 students does it automatically qualify as not having bell curve? In that case how much do I have to score to get a B+ and above? Does anyone have the full breakdown of grades?

It’s definitely too late for me to turn back and I have no choice but to stick with it for the rest of my life. I hadn’t been doing well in school, constantly getting mediocre grades (when I say mediocre I really mean it, e.g B, B-). I am worried for my future. 

P.S: Please don’t leave negative comments. I am merely expressing myself because I have nowhere else to let it out. "
62334,"My girlfriend got ""bumped""  into by an old man and she didn't feel comfortable about it. It wasn't the usual kind of bump against the shoulder which I'm all too familiar with.

While my girlfriend may have experienced a legitimate bump, we can't discount the fact that it's possible for someone to make a ""bump with a motive"". Some quick googling led me to find cases where air stewardesses facing this and a boyfriend landing into jail for assaulting someone who allegedly ""bumped"" into his girlfriend.

Going along this logic, it's actually possible for someone to molest a lot of women and actually get away scot-free.

As a boyfriend, I would love to know what's the most appropriate way to deal with this. If I involve the police, I 'd expect little or no action taken due to the lack of evidence. If I treat old man a knuckle sandwich, i'd be landing myself into jail. If I let this go too often, both my girlfriend and I would be questioning my ability to protect her. 

But as a male myself, I would hate it if I legitly bumped into a female accidentally and she screamed molest on me.

What's the best course of action should our society to take to protect our loved ones from ""accidental bumps"" without giving us males any trouble? Is legislation even possible for such scenarios?"
62331,"To the OP of #62331

Do not be disheartened. I am somewhat like you. I do not have any material wealth to speak of. I come from an extremely humble background, my family were homeless for a few years even and we sought refuge under the roofs of relatives.

That being said, it wasn't all that bad. I mean, I'm here in Asia's best university aren't I? I somehow beat the odds but I had a lot of help along the way.

Also, I have been dating someone from a background that could not be more different than mine. She comes from an extremely wealthy family. And yet she chose me, someone who came from nothing.

She told me that she was attracted to me because of the fact that I am a person of strong character. Guess what? It was precisely because of the long years of hardship and uncertainty that had annealed me into this person. (So make your unfortunate circumstances count)

However, while the 2 parties may be happy with each other, people will say things. Nasty things. Especially if one party is not only poor but of a race that is stereotyped as ""cannot make it one"". You'll have people saying to her ""are you sure he's that intelligent?"" (because intelligence is only accorded to the upper echelons of society right) or ""people who are *my race* cannot make it one la"" or just about anything to do with race or SES. This is when you really need to know yourself (where you come from and what you are) and to acknowledge that others probably would not accept this union due to their own selfish reasons."
62322,"Still laughing as I'm typing.

So earlier today, I got this call from a company which I interviewed with for their marketing role a few months back.

THEY WERE FUUUUUUURIOUS! Here's the story.

I'm still taking my Degree so I don't have much to show in my resume (except for having a direct mentorship/collab with some of the marketing personalities/giants around the world) compared to other candidates and a strong freelance portfolio.

BUT then again, I do not have that piece of paper yet.

There was a total of three person interviewing me. From their choice of words and body language and how my paper was placed, I knew that I've wasted my printer ink and showing them testimonials from names that  they can't appreciate.

Finally, one of them asked, ""I have this ____ product, tell me how would you market it?""

Yo, I have been a freelancer, they have not paid me. So I went on to tell them a legit plan while leaving out the important parts, confidently, since I know my own creation well. All three of them were intrigued to the point that you can almost see the stars in their eyes.

""We will get in touch with you."" That was the last I ever heard from them. Before leaving, I took away the last few pages of my resume out of their copies, I don't like to have my mentors names to be in a pile. It's, to me, a sign of disrespect. My works can be in there, but never my mentors.

I think they invested quite a bit into this strategy thus the representative was quite furious over the phone. 

I'm not sure about how you interviewers will think of me (I don't care for your opinions if you're like the company in the story), but hey, is your recruitment drive just a channel for FREE IDEA GENERATION?

If you want something, you pay for it.

For students or future jobseekers, please, I IMPLORE y'all to be smart about it. I have known of IT companies holding recruitment drives and let the candidates solve their current issue and ultimately, hired no one.

Don't put yourself on the losing end.

p.s. If they have hired me, I'd have definitely put my name on the line to fill up the holes in the plan and realise it."
62319,"It has almost been a year.

Those sleepless nights thinking about my code. The various sighs of how things could have ended better. The neon green light on a black laptop that sat on the desk. The emails marking the end of the course and semester.

The many thoughts that ran through my mind as I held the mug of coffee with both hands.


Silent wondering, if perhaps one year from now the exact same thoughts are running through the minds of the next graduating batch.

But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if I'm alone now or with a company of friends, because all these won't be important soon enough.

All the best guys.

-F.A."
62317,"A couple of quick points that I think are worth noting from the recent voyeurism incident.

First, justice isn’t constrained to retribution. There are other principles of justice such as deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, and restoration – retribution is but one of such principles. This has been rightly pointed out by NUSSU which noted that NUS places greater weight on rehabilitation given that it is an educational institution. Bear in mind that there is no suggestion that rehabilitation should be the primary focus for all institutions – only that it is the focus of NUS. Other institutions (such as the SPF) are better placed to dish out retribution. 

Second, assuming that retribution should be the primary focus (which clearly is not for NUS), there are questions as to (1) who can dish out such punishment (2) what the scope of such punishment should be. It is not for the public to be judge, jury and executioner all at once. It is not on the public to play vigilante – a bit at no risk to themselves and oftentimes nothing more than virtue signalling – or to be part of a lynch mob. Furthermore, punishment should be just and appropriate. While many commentators have kept this in mind (indeed this is their complaint – that the punishment is unfair), there are others like Rice Media which has gone on to suggest that NUS should not study the approaches of other institutions and “the only feedback they should listen to is the victim’s”. The ridiculousness of the above statement should be apparent to all – taking the author’s premise to its logical end would mean that readers who have to bear with Rice Media’s typo or grammatical errors are entitled to call for the website to shut itself down. 

Third, what is unfair punishment? It’s a rather difficult concept to grapple with; most of us base this off our intuition. I would suggest to you that there has been no procedural unfairness or impropriety in the way NUS handled the situation – they rightly convened a disciplinary hearing and did not stop the victim from reporting the perpetrator to the police. The only unfairness appears to be in the substance – that the perpetrator did not get the punishment he deserved. This is a justified concern, but it bears remembering that NUS does not concern itself solely with retribution; rather, rehabilitation is their focus. My guess is that a lot of us would be a lot more content with NUS’ decision if the perpetrator had actually been charged – one term suspension wouldn’t seem so bad since the perpetrator got his “just desserts”. But this does not concern NUS at all – the question is why and how prosecutorial discretion has been exercised in the manner it was. 

Fourth, what happens even if we collectively agree that a suspension is too light a punishment? Should the perpetrator’s punishment be increased then? The answer intuitively appears to be a resounding ‘yes’ but I would again suggest that the answer should be in the negative. NUS dished out such punishment in accordance with precedent and their own guidelines; one will find remarkable consistency in the (light) punishments they have meted out to those who have committed sexual offences. However, should we alter punishments and apply them retrospectively to a perpetrator? What happens when we allow this to happen? Article 11(1) of our Constitution states that “No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.” I note that administrative guidelines do not necessarily amount to law, but I will suggest that the same principle behind Article 11 applies in this case. 

This does not mean however that we should all keep quiet and let the incident fade into our distant memories. We should be calling for change. But the point of such change isn’t retribution of change. Even as the victim notes, change should be for the future, to ensure that we have better policies in place. 

Last, I should add that I sympathise with the harm suffered by the victim, and in no way condone what the perpetrator has done. A disclaimer like this should not be necessary but I don’t think I should take any chances. This is NUSWhispers after all.

62316,"A shout out to Nicholas Lim who may be reading this: I am your fellow chem eng senior (grad student in fact) and I write this note bona fide, so please keep calm and read on. Yes, although I follow the majority who condemn your actions, I also feel that you have indeed already received similar sanctions to previous cases and that the backlash campaign conducted against you has long overshot its objectives. I neither support nor have taken any part in it. I just want to point out to you that from reading a lot of comments here on NUSWhispers and elsewhere, I noticed that most seem to get their fuel from (perceived) lack of closure to this case. In good faith, I advise you to come out just this once and issue another public apology, that should take most of the fuel out from the online mob and also give the moderate camp more voice to help mitigate the situation online. "
62315,"With regards to the recent saga, it's funny how there's a group of people who are bashing NUS for their personal motives. There's either that person who says that it is lucky that he/she didn't go to the school or that he/she will no longer plan to go to the school in the future. Hmm are they trying to justify that it is not that they could not attend the school but that they didn't want to? I wonder what's the point in doing so. And then there's that other person who just keep criticising or mocking the school without giving any useful comments. I can't deny that I'm particularly annoyed by these people because I'm a student from NUS. I just can't understand why these people have to capitalise on this opportunity to fulfil their own unhappiness against the school oops. "
62309,"Can somebody enlighten me on the thought processes behind people who comments on the Straits Times articles? NUS President apologises: ""He should step down!"",  ""NUS is a disgrace!"", ""Too late for apology!"". How are your comments of any use? If you believe in helping the victim, why don't you give some constructive comments? I believe that the school's current disciplinary measures are less than satisfactory but right now, shouldn't we take a step back and give them a chance to work on it? To be honest, there are probably many other institutions who are lacking in this aspect as well. Instead of constantly picking on what NUS did wrong, why don't these people start looking at it from an overall viewpoint and give some useful suggestions so that we can improve the situation in Singapore? PS. If you never read the comments section before, please don't because some of the comments will really blow your mind."
