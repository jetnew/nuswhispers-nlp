56999,"Hi, does anyone experience this too - I get really anxious and breathless when I find myself squeezed between many people in crowded places (like peak hour mrt cabins). Never really had this problem before but recently I felt myself feeling really uncomfortable when there are so many people just crowding around me. 

Some people can just kind of zone out with music or social media browsing but I really can't even effectively distract myself... 

Is this claustrophobia? Am i just bing paranoid? Just the sight of massively large crowds flooding a certain place is quite unbearable. Less on an emotionally frustrated level but more so, it makes me physically unwell. 

How am I supposed to go out to work 5-6 days a week in the future.... "
56998,"hi i’m an a level kid that applied for nus early admissions. my choices are such: A with double major B, B then A. however now im considering just taking up B. if they give me A w double major B, can i just appeal during the appeal stage? what are the chances of success? also, if i get a nus scholarship before this appeal, would it be affected?"
56997,"Dear RVRC Residents (both exchange and full time),

IDK bout other RCs and halls but... 

PLEASE note that WATER COOLERS are for DRINKING PURPOSES. Filling water to brush your teeth is still tolerable, but several times have I encountered people filling buckets meant for mopping the floor and washing dusty containers meant for storing their things, probably cuz the sink is too small for the buckets and containers.

To the RVRC Management Team, I believe it wouldn't hurt to improve such serious hygiene issue by simply placing a sign around the coolers that ""WATER COOLERS ARE FOR DRINKING PURPOSES ONLY"". The effortless act of putting up a simple sign can prevent UNSUSTAINABLE water-borne diseases from contaminating our water source. (can someone bring this to their attention?)

Admin, this is a serious issue towards the health of residents. Don't censor."

56995,"I'm graduating after this sem (May 2019) and my cap is borderline 1st class. I've started job applications since December but yet to receive anything. Should I be panicking? Legit question, no trolling pls"
56994,"#56994: that's how my previous relationship ended.

We were together for 3 years and there was a weird period when I have already been working for 2 years while she was just freshly graduated. It was a stressful time for her: not being able to find a job and feeling like a failure. it was rather bad of me not knowing how to assuage my gf's worries. I was rather callous, sarcastic, and uncaring at times. Things started peeling off; over a long period of time. Maybe don't come over to have dinner with her family (it was frequent), maybe ""I want some time alone going places"", etc ... 

Then it's the ""let's take a break from each other"". A month later, breakup. There were tear, drunkenness, bitterness. etc ...

Our relationship had lots of ups and down. We had sex, then we stopped. Why we stopped was because of a stupid argument (my bad). In short, she wanted to do it bareback during her period and I don't. I was a hypochondriac and when I knew she had unprotected sex with her bf, I was reluctant to do the same with her afterwards. I tried to played it as ""it's not that I don't trust you; I don't trust your ex"". it somehow ended as ""OK, let's not do it"" but because we were horny af, we continued with everything else. Thinking back, the frequency of arguments picked up when we stopped the sex.

I learned a lot from that episode and grew from it. How to tone down the sarcasm, general bitterness, and pessimism. How to be supportive and not snap at the first sign of trouble. And how when you start having sex, don't stop. Good thing too, since about 2 months after the breakup, I met my now-wife. It has been a good 4 years, 2 being married."
56993," Hi OP of #56959.

-SMU's Round 2 of bidding is also during the first week of school.

56992,"Need advise, no trolls please. I’ve been attached for 2 years now and we’re quite happy together. My bf is neither hot nor rich but he is caring and understanding. Like although he only earns about $2k+, he still brings me to movies and dinner dates...treats me to hotel buffets - which can be quite costly like $100 per pax - on special occassions. He gives me time and space when i’m busy prepping for exams or projects. 

However, recently I came to know a girl whom kinda likes me. I think she would be my gf if I were to work on it a little. It would also solve all the questions about my lack of gf and my dream to have children. 

Do you think I should break off with my bf although I really love him? I’m not attracted to the girl but definitely can see myself living with her...."
56991,"#56991: Your Prof clearly doesn't have your best interests at heart. It happened to me too. Most NUS Profs see you as an investment (to train) and therefore do not see any benefit from serving as your referee when you apply for overseas universities. Your My former NUS Prof actually told me I would be better off remaining as his/her technician/RA than doing a PhD abroad. 

Just look for another referee from your undergrad or do another internship.  A good potential PhD supervisor will overlook the lack of a reference from your MSc supervisor, if you have a proper explanation. Keep your head up and don't look back."
56990,"Lately, I’ve been looking up information about my ex online. I keep wanting find out how my ex is doing from other sources. How do I get rid of this habit and start focusing on finding someone new? TBH it’s very hard for me to channel my heart to someone else and also, to concentrate on this new semester"
56989,"In reply to #56980 —

OP of #56959 here; I'm aware of all the problems the other OP listed; that's *exactly* why I said 'albeit with a few caveats'.

My point, however, had nothing to do with NUS having an appeal system, or NUS having tutorial balloting, or SMU not refunding points, etc. For all the accusations that I've committed a logical fallacy, I think OP of #56980 has done the same thing— they have built a straw man. 

I only brought SMU up at the end as an example; my key (and only) point was that NUS' bidding/balloting is scheduled too late, to the extent that it ends well past the start of the semester, and that my personal belief (with incomplete information, of course—I don't work at the Registrar's Office) was that NUS could bring the entire process forward (perhaps starting shortly after results release) without affecting any of CORS' features, like appeals, point refunds, balloting, etc. 

Nevertheless, all this discussion is in vain, because CORS will be scrapped starting the next academic year. I thoroughly expect a mess for at least the next two semesters as teething issues are fixed and the dust settles.

56988,Hello has anyone taken GET1022 Understand your brain before? Tried to look for reviews online but can’t find any. Any seniors can share their experience? Thank you :)

56986,GEH1036 ez mod. Just spend 1 day for midterm and 1/2 days for finals. No need attend tutorials or lectures xD
56983,"The other side of the story #56983- 
It's true people catch feelings for another person while currently being attached. But have you ever been the bf/gf who completely trusts your partner, actively tries working on the relationship because you love them and yet, are kept in the dark by the same person you trusted and valued so much. This is even worse when your partner catches feelings for someone in your close friend circle and neither of them tell you anything. You find out the truth in the worst way possible- you find out that your friend had even proposed to your partner from other friends.

Well, this was me. I know it's understandable that people catch feelings for another while currently being attached. But my request to these people is that, if you respect your partner even a little bit and value their emotions, please open up to them. It's hard enough as it is to hear your partner likes someone else, but to find out about this from other people, it gets much more difficult to move on.

Recently found out that one of my close friends proposed to my gf and that she likes him and was leading him on. Seems like my whole world is crumbling down. Is it possible to move on?

56982,"Admins pls dont filter!!!!

CS seniors what are your thoughts on taking cs2030 during special term vs next year sem 1?"
56979,"I want to add on to #56959's rant about the current system. Having round 3 bidding and tutorial balloting happening after school starts just adds unnecessary frustration. 

Module bidding: For students unfortunate to not get what they want within rounds 1 & 2 or those who want to overload, being forced to wait till round 3 is just plain stupid, and it almost feels like you're being neglected by the school just because most people have already got what they need.

Tutorial balloting: After getting our lecture slots, we'll already be going to school and listening to lectures. But then having to deal with the time sensitive add drop swaps during the final round WHILE in school makes it kind of hard to focus in lectures, particularly for those who desparately need it.

Some of these concerns/details may be small, but it's the small things that add up to make NUS a better place for students. And besides it just makes sense to have all the timetables fixed before school starts, is it that hard? "
56976,"I just watched Crazy Rich Asians, and I can't be the only one disgusted by this movie? Many friends seemed to like it, a few even going as far as to tout it as the best movie in 2018 -.-"

56972,"i came from a broken family. even though my dad is relatively decent to me and my sister but he has been cheating on my mom since forever and they are still married because my mom refuses to give up on him. i have seen photos of him with other women since young and we even found love letters in his drawer... just a few months ago when i went to dig the rubbish to find something that i accidentally threw away i found his credit card bills, showing that he has been to various hotels in sg prolly with prostitutes. i know you guys will probably tell me, it's your parents business that their marriage failed. why am i complaining so much. 
well the thing is. ever since i am aware of what my dad has been doing, i find it difficult to trust guys at all. even when my guy was just talking a bit too much to my friend, i went berserk inside, thinking that he is cheating on me. i tried really hard to convince myself that there is nothing going on, but the thoughts of my dad cheating just keeps coming back to me. it is hard to believe that anyone can love just one person forever. i really just want to trust my guy and not worry about any bitch that starts talking to him but i can't and i don't think it is possible for me to trust anyone at all. this is really unfair because i already suffered so much in childhood and this shit follows me into adulthood and possibly forever..."
56971,"Hi, does anyone know if Get1028 Logic lectures are webcasted?"
56970,"Hi. This is for those wanting to take GEH1036 Living with Mathematics but not concerned with difficulty or bell-curve:
""The objective of this course is to exhibit some simple mathematical ideas that permeate a modern society and to show how a reasonably numerate person can use these ideas in everyday life and, in the process, gain an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematical ideas. ""
(This is found in CORS or the module description in the math department website)

Looking at the above paragraph, one can infer the module will certainly be easy as long as you know a bit of math. This claim can be corroborated easily by asking whoever has taken the module before. However this module has no preclusion, so anyone can take it. That is if you are willing to pay for it as module quota often fills up quickly.

Reason why I am doing this is that I feel one should not think that this module is not for him/her just because the bell curve is too steep, or it is hard to get a good grade for it. (or any other reason that is similar to what I wrote). Rather, you may want to consider whether you are appreciative of what is taught in the module that shapes the modern society today. I believe this is the primary learning outcome of this module, no different to any other GE module you know of. I'm hoping you want to take modules you are more interested in, and not just getting an easy A on your transcript.

TLDR: Are you interested in the CONTENT of GEH1036? If yes then go ahead and read it. Do not be put off by the bell curve.

Would I still be able to bid for another module during round 3 though? I currently have 20MCs already. Otherwise do I have to ‘drop’ one existing module to do so. How does this cors thing work??Thanks!"
56965,"Because of how poorly NUS presents their information on their graduate programmes, I'm went from being keen to pursuing a Masters to not at all entertaining their thought. I've asked the staff so many times and they show me attitude and don't tell me the accurate information or give me contradictory information. They don't put down how special programmes work so by now I've missed the deadline because they vaguely put down when you should apply without specifying what your progress should be by then. You have to look so hard to find out what modules you need to take to qualify.

NUS chases KPIs and has screwed over students so many times in so many areas. At the very least, new universities are opening up and we're more aware of how shitty NUS can be."

56908,"So something has been bugging me since the year started and I just wanted to gather suggestions on what I should do. 

My boyfriend’s ex is like a 打不死的蟑螂. They broke up in 2016, a year before he got together with me, but this bitch somehow just refuses to stop contacting him. Mind you, she got attached pretty soon after they broke up and she was the one who showed disinterest in the relationship months leading up to the break up. In the one year period when I haven’t entered the picture, (my bf told me that) she would text him occasionally pretending that things were like before, asking him out for lunch etc, even when he has already made it very clear that he wants a clean break and doesn’t want anything to do with her anymore. It even escalated to the point where she told him she’s sex deprived, which just made him speechless (lol probably cause her bf is in army). 

The last time she texted him was in Dec 2017 (when we just got together) and asked if he was free for dinner, but he just coldly replied that he wasn’t free. So I thought she was out of our lives for good, until a couple days before NYE. It was 3am in the morning and she sent 2 text full of typos (took us awhile to decipher what she was trying to say), wishing for him to last long and thanking him for the lesson (???). He did not bother replying her.

It might be overthinking on my part and maybe I’m reading too much into the texts…… but some womanly instinct tells me there’s something more to them than it seems. SHE KEEPS APPEARING EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN’T ENTERTAIN HER. Plus, she is still attached till date -- which is why all these doesn’t make sense to me. And just imagine if her bf finds out she is still contacting her ex… lol. Thinking from a woman’s perspective, I really really really don’t know what she is trying to get out of this. 

I have considered sharing my insecurities with my boyfriend. We are very open and share literally everything with each other. But honestly, what do I expect him to say? None of this is his fault and there’s nothing he can do also. I’m afraid I might make him feel bad for making me feel insecure also. 

Is there anything I can do or say to make this stop? To make her truly vanish? I mean, I know her number and her Instagram, if it matters.
