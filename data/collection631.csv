63198,"Hello! Is it just me or is it tough to find guys right now? I’m female, haven’t had a Boyfriend before because I’ve  always concentrated on having fun with friends and work/school. Now that I’m looking, it’s tough to find people at school and tinder/CMB really sucks cos all of the guys I’ve spoken to only want a casual relationship/FWB and I prefer to have a steady relationship... Any advice?"
63196,should i go for scamp or just go for my major's camp? heard that people mostly make hi bye friends in faculty camp so i don't know whether the 85 bucks is worth it or not... but also afraid of not being able to make friends in uni because i'm quite introverted...
63194,"How important is it to work hard in your work/ career? I am actually a slack person. In school, I am secretly envious of those who didn't do much in projects and yet can still get good marks. In the working world, I understand there are people who do the minimum and avoid work and yet still keep the job and even get promoted. I hope to learn this art from these people."
63193,"Hi there, would like to seek help from CS students or Profs. I still do not get what is the difference between CS1020/CS2010/CS2030/CS2040? I have taken CS1010S before but what would be my next step if I want to learn more? Thanks!"
63190,"Does anyone have worked with indian technical recruiter who cant take no for an answer? This week, one of them found my resume on monster and reached out to me for an opportunity, I said no, they still forwarded my resume to their client which then arranged an interview. I told them no but they still arranged it and informed me via email. On that day of interview, she called my several times which I ignored and then emailed me claiming that I sabotaged their client and reputation by notturning up for the interview. Tell me, how the hell should I handle this situation? Your replies/advice are much appreciated."
63188,"Feeling very lost and confused because on the same day today I met my ex-crush coincidentally while heading out to meet my bf and this ex-crush was with his younger sister and he cheerfully introduced his sister to me, ""This is my sister!"". Oppositely, my bf hates it when I meet his family members even if it is by pure chance, you can see it thru his body lang becuz he gets so worked up n fidgety, nervous etc. What shud i do i feel extremely hurt...????????"
63185,"Hi, I'm the OP of #63185. First off, would like to thank everyone for their input and opinions. The percentages are not calculated from criteria per se (hell no how does one even properly quantify feelings - I definitely do not go around grading people) it is just to give a better gauge/visualisation. Just like how food is rated (bad analogy I know but hey). Thanks for the link to Ted, realised that is what I have actually been doing (feeling things out) which resulted in that miss while I was deliberating whether to make a move (group/clique/cohort dynamics really did not help, some of you might think that's just an excuse but it just was not a priority in that moment, potentially trashing a few friendships while trying to sort uni life out you know). I do agree it is a HUUUGE waste (curse myself sometimes) but given the circumstances I wouldn't say it was necessarily the wrong logical decision at that point in time (I cannot see parallel universes after all, and we are still rather close friends so I'll take that). And a miss is a miss so no point crying over spilt milk (and beating me over it I beat myself over it [sometimes] enough I should think), just trying to figure out how to move on from here on!"
63182,"Am i a loser if i only want to spend my lifetime around my parents? I go to NUS because its near my home, and my parents are old already.... Everytime I have an opportunity to go for vacation with friends/ study abroad maybe, I will alwayd trun these opportunuty down , giving in to my thought 
"" my mum is old, im afraid she got alzhemier""  
""What if they got hurt and bleed then if im not around?""

I feel my thoughts are excuses that prevent me from trying out unfamiliar environment. To be honest ive never go for a vacation or go far from home. I dont even know how to drive and I tend to talk softly and fake pleasing smiles whenever im outside into places im not familiar with.
 Im already near 24 years old and i feel terrible. Any advice please"
63178,"I wonder why do people complain about friend zone.

I am currently just friends with my crush, and I am totally satisfied

We message each other on WhatsApp and hang out often.

Of course I do dream about her being my girlfriend, but what is wrong with being friends for now?"
63177,"To OP of #63163:
I understand how you feel; sometimes your strength and your interest just doesn't coincide.

My strength is in Computing but my interest is in Physics. I chose to pursue my interest and it is no doubt very very tough. Nonetheless, I have got to say that I enjoy it a lot; never once have I lost the wonder and passion in this subject despite its difficult nature. Whenever the content gets tough (and it gets really abstract very quickly in Physics), I can really feel my amazement and awe in this subject pulling me through.

I believe that had I gone for Computing, my future will be brighter since it is the up-and-coming demand of the working world. But I have got to say that I really enjoyed my time in University because I studied something I liked. Will I have enjoyed as much if I had went for my strength instead? I don't know but in all honesty, I don't think so. My poly experience has informed me that studying something I am good at and breezing through it is nowhere near as rewarding as struggling through something that I enjoy and come out on the other side of it.

I sound like a scumbag for saying this, but I will take lower-level CS modules to pull my CAP up because Physics is too difficult while I can easily breeze through those CS modules (I'm really not trying to brag). So perhaps you can consider taking up language/arts as a minor (or even 2nd major), but study something you enjoy will definitely give a lot more fulfillment and joy than something you are good at."
63176,#63163 Just go for your interest and take up science. You’ll have one full year of SU option for you to get used to the curriculum anyway. You can also take some modules from arts as electives. Transfer after one semester if you don’t like the course. *subjected to approval from faculty department.
63175,"To #63175 and #63218: I would like to share my experience with u guys. So I have just graduated, and met my ex in JC and we were together after A levels for quite a while, for 4 years until uni year 2. Similar to u guys she had the same problem, unrealistic expectations and expecting me to pay. Now don't get me wrong, who doesn't like to treat their girl? But I like to be the one to offer. But it became obvious that it went from being a treat to an obligation. Now before, I continue, I acknowledge this is only my side of the story, and I am just sharing my view point. If anyone is offended by this, I apologise in advance, but please don’t be too angry, it is just my story.

There were countless times where the red flags continuously showed. From her getting upset at me for not buying her flowers, even though our date was at a classy restaurant (and I’m paying), to her complaining about not receiving gifts (again even though I’m paying). She often compared me to other guys she saw on Instagram saying “this guy did this for his gf…etc.”. She was also incredibly high maintenance, she expected me to listen to her every problem, no matter how childish they were, but she never bothered to care about my problems. Ironically, she often gave that ""roll eye"" look and said I was not being a ""man"" when I talked about my problems. Also, she used sex and intimacy to control the relationship and expected me to share my bank PIN with her because it was a “sign of trust.”

Sounds familiar? But deep down, I always closed one eye, because I felt that she gave me “support” and brought “joy” to my life. We were together for 4 years, and I thought she was definitely the one I would marry. Hence when her family was going through financial difficulty, I paid for every date, because I believe that it was “us” against the world.

But I can guarantee you one thing, I was definitely and always be wrong. Remove the intimacy from the relationship, and my ex had nothing to offer. She was someone who wanted things, but doesn’t want to work for it nor does she even bother to try. The only reason she did things for other is because she expected others to do the same for her. The whole relationship was me being blinded by love.

Eventually towards the end of 4 years, I really questioned myself and realized that this was not the partner I want nor will I ever want. And we broke up, it was kind of a rushed breakup, but it was because I really had enough. I wasn’t sad when we broke up, for some reason I felt really relieved.

I do admit I do miss her from time to time, but I know what I missed were the memories, not the person.

This is the advice I can give you both: a relationship is not a feeling, it is not love, it is a commitment. After all, our bank accounts are not unlimited, if your partner fails to realise that and insist that you paying is a “sign” of love, please, don’t be blinded by love. While people were saving, my bank account decreased greatly during those 4 years, and I have nothing to show for it after spending that much.

Trust me, if anyone out here is in a relationship and asking yourself this question: “Why am I paying all the time?” or you notice yourself spending less on other things just so you can keep up with spending in your relationship. Recognize that no matter how good your partner may seem, it is a recipe for failure in the long term, especially if you plan on living forever with that person.

Fast forward to today, I graduated from NUS and I am still single. But during the last 2 years of my uni life, I was free and I worked on myself. I was able to do all the things I was unable to do and improve myself greatly. Going to the gym and learning new hobbies. 

Eventually I would want to date someone else, but for now, I want to improve me first!

Remember, the first step to loving someone is to be able to love yourself first. If you have to sacrifice loving yourself and your own happiness to love someone else, you are not in love, you are in a dream, and you better wake up. If your wants are causing a problem in a relationship. Please wake up too and go and run 10 rounds around the parade square. For me, I knew it was a problem because I wanted to save for our future, but she wanted to spend it all because “we are young only once.”

Our society has trained us to be materialistic, and is often hard to find partners who do not compare, partners who look on Instagram and see other boyfriends and be jealous. It is not their fault, this is the effect of social media.
For those who have loving partners, partners who tell you they want to eat cheap to help you save money, the partners who sit down and listen to even your smallest problems, and never condescend you, the partners who you know will never let their wants get in the way or cause problems in the relationship. Please, hold them close, and tell them everyday that you love them. Because they are indeed a rare breed that will only get rarer.
Best of luck!"
63174,"I got married recently after years of dating with my husband. However, I do not stay with him and we rarely meet as we are both working at different ends of SG. Whenever I suggested to meet him on my off day, while he is working that day, he would tell me not to and just do my things. I appreciate that he care for me but as years goes by, the meetup got even lesser and shorter. If we are lucky to have the same time off, we would just meet for lunch/dinner and head back to our own home.  On daily basis, we just text 'good morning / what we are doing / good night'. 
While at work, there was this colleague G from another office, who started talking to me and would drop by once awhile to chat. He even started teasing me, confessing his feelings for me. He is much older than me, married with kid. He knows I am also married. Although he confessed his feelings, he also told me that he would be responsible for his family for life and would not betray his wife. We started texting each other when our work hours happen to meet. However, on days that either of us are not working, we do not contact each other as we do know that we are with our family and respect that. I know I should not be doing this but I really look forward to seeing him at work and seeing his texts."
63172,"Gf of many years doesnt like kids, but I do. I fear she may be a terrible mother as she has depression, and it may get worse if she forces herself to have kids.

63171,Are you okay if your partner treats his/her relatives better than he treats you? E.g. pay for their meals most of the time while splitting 50-50 with you and listening more to them rather than you? My bf's like that and idk how to feel honestly.
63168,"Should I go on SEP just to maintain my CAP at second upper? Will the cost of SEP outweigh the cons of potentially graduating with second lower (lower employment rates etc) 

Thank you"
63167,"To #62820

It is generally inadvisable go pursue a masters directly after undergraduate studies, especially if you only have a second lower. You need FCH. 

Furthermore, local masters are targeted towards FCH from overseas. If you're interested in pursuing a masters, I suggest pursuing it overseas, where it is easier."

63161,"Hi, I’m the OP of #63161. Thanks for leaving your comments. My friend and I met up and talked it through. Maybe I should have set some context. My friend and I are both gay, we have no romantic feelings for the other (as far as I know) and are just merely best friends. I apologised to him for using that language. Then, I sought for clarification on why he thinks I’m not a good friend. Again, he brought up the same two reasons: I don’t text him first and I am not often the one who initiates the plan to meet up with him. He said that he feels anxious when people don’t reply him and he doesn’t quite know how to follow-up in the event that I don’t respond to his messages. I am aware he’s dealing with anxiety issues and to that point, I said that I would be fine if he wanted to prompt me for a reply. I would not feel imposed.

When he was finished with his part, I explained to him why I reacted in such a manner and why I thought his words were unfair. On the first reason, I told him that I am not the sort to text or respond immediately. I look at the urgency of a message, and I respond accordingly. Sometimes that takes a few hours; other times, I reply immediately. In every instance I’ve responded to him, I’ve replied enthusiastically. I don’t write monosyllable answers. I take time to craft a thoughtful response complete with emojis and gifs. He felt that I responded too slowly; to that point, I agreed but said that that is not something I will change or give in to him. I emphasised that if it was something urgent, he can call me directly and I will make the time for him. 

On the second reason, I agreed that I could take more initiative to plan meetups with him. I confessed to sometimes relying on him to plan things for us.  This is something I will work on. Everything is well now between me and my friend. 

Final point, I wanted to respond to a comment left in my earlier confession. Someone said that a person who doesn’t care about texts they get is not someone worth showing respect. I wonder how the hell you would have survived in an age prior to any forms of messaging technologies. I completely disagree with you and think it’s utter bullshit to expect someone to respond to texts they get. I don’t live my life on my phone. So if I think your message is non-urgent and you are not my close friend, I sure as hell am not going to respond to you. We like to think we’re the centre of the universe in our friends’ lives, but that’s not the case and it shouldn’t be. If you want your friend’s attention, text/call and ask him or her for a meetup. Catch up over a meal or coffee. The best conversations are done face-to-face and not over texts. But you know what? You do you. I'll do me.

To Megan, your comment was the most helpful. You reminded me to approach the subject gently; because I know my friend is going through anxiety issues and I didn't want to hurt him. Thank you."
63160,"Current students of Yale-NUS College, do you have any advice on fitting in in YNC?

I'm holding an offer from YNC, but I find it very hard to connect with the people there, based on my experiences at several YNC events, e.g. Experience Yale-NUS Weekend.

Mostly because I'm a very boring person compared to the people there. Most of them are very knowledgeable, passionate, or talented at something, whereas I have nothing but good A-level results, so I find it very hard to talk to them about anything.

Does anyone know what I can do to avoid being isolated after I enter YNC? I really want to become a popular person, but I can't do that if I can't even connect with anyone."

Answer to the question ‘how can a 5 months contract job provide career progression’( see footnote):

1. Choose option 2
2. Perform well

I will be valuable in the job market.

63151,"I graduated last year and working for close to a year already. I am finding myself missing dearly on NUS life. Back then, I lived in hall and joined 2 CCAs. I always have big groups of friends to hang out with and my social life is really fulfilling. Now, it seems everyone is preoccupied with their careers and partners and always too busy to meet up as a group. I only have 2-3 friends whom I meet up occasionally. I felt that life has slowed down and has become peaceful and mundane. I tried joining an interest group in a CC but those people there are mostly uncles and aunties and the age gap is too big. I left soon after. How can I deal with my boredom? It will be good if there is some kind of group out there for young people to hang out with frequently."

63147,"Guy here. In these couple of years, I have put on weight, got a fatter stomach and showed signs of balding. I am really embarrassed about my appearance. It seems my body is maturing much faster than people in my age group. It is so obvious that I am often mistaken for a middle aged man by people who don't know me. How can I get over my body image issues?"
63146,"Recently I have some disagreements with my girlfriend. I am a highly introverted person and my girlfriend wants me to open up to people and change. She said it would benefit my personal and working life. However, I have always been like this and it is really painful and difficult to change my personality (I think fellow introverts would be able to relate to this). I have always been comfortable for who I am, my life has been ok so far and I don't see any need to change. I don't need to have a big active social life or be a top charismatic leader in my work. Because of this, we have numerous disagreements and she said I appear too quiet, low profile and invisible among people and it is not good for my image. I really feel it's unfair as I have never asked her to change any part of her personality. After all, being introverted is not a bad habit that needs to be corrected and loving a person should mean accepting him/her for all he/she is right? I feel I am stuck and don't know how to move on. Or should I just call it quits on the relationship?"
63144,"I don't understand why so many of you commenters have so much hate for girls who got ""bored of their relationship"". 

What's wrong with getting bored of your rs? If you're feeling bored then it probably means you have lost interest in that person. It's not like you can control how you feel towards someone. 

bored of him = lost interest in him = no feelings already = unhappy

What's the point of being with someone you have no feelings for? Would you date that guy you friendzoned? No right cos you have no feelings for him.

Maybe someone better came along and made you lose interest in your bf. Then you want to leave your bf for the new guy.

You commenters keep saying that Karma will strike her, the new guy will dump her when he gets bored of her, blah blah blah. 

SO WHAT? Get dumped means it's the end of the world issit? weaklings.

Just because you're scared of karma, you wanna give up on a potential rs which could give you so much beautiful memories?

Some say you only regret the things you didn't do and not the ones you've done. 

No point crying over spilled milk. What's done is done, even if you regret also cannot undo right. So there's no point in regretting the things you've done.

So you'll only regret not doing whatever you always wanted to do. Because if you never try, you'll never know right. How would you know the outcome of the rs if you never try. 

Look, if you truly love someone, you won't get bored of him so easily. I'm talking about being bored OVERALL, not the ""one day you're bored, next day you're not"". Like over a period of time, you just don't feel happy being with your bf anymore. 

Life's short. Why waste time on people who don't make you feel happy anymore. If you don't feel happy anymore, you should leave him so he can find someone who actually likes him.

I had a bf whom I broke up with because I lost interest in him after a year. He's now happily married. Apparently he's definitely happier now and I am happy for him too.

And yup, I got my karma too. I once broke up with a guy when I met someone better. This new guy then dumped me after a year. I guess he got bored of me. I was really sad but I moved on anyway. 

To be honest I am very thankful for that guy for dumping me. If he never dumped me, I wouldn't have met my current bf. And just because the rs ended, it doesn't mean the rs was for nothing. We had so much beautiful memories and that really meant alot to me. 

I've been with my current bf for 7 years. He's a super boring guy with a very routine life. He doesn't have many hobbies, at most just gaming and watching movies.

He may seem boring but I am never bored of him. Even after 7 years, I still look forward to seeing him every single time.

He still makes me laugh alot. And when I look at him, I still find him very good-looking although he has put on a lot of weight over the years. And I still enjoy spending time with him although we meet almost everyday. 

I know some of you will say I might get bored of him one day and dump him or he would dump me. I don't care. seriously. 

Why think so much? You're not a fortune teller. You cannot predict the future can you? So what's the point of overthinking about the future?

If you like someone and feel happy being with him, just cherish him. If you don't feel happy being with him anymore, just let him go so he can find someone who deserves him more.

I had this bf of 2 years who was also kinda cute but very boring. After I started working, I met this guy who's very smart, attractive and charismatic. He also asked me out despite knowing I have a bf. 

I asked him why he wants to go out with me despite knowing I am attached. He said he just wanted to be friends with me. 

After hanging out with him a few times, I decided to break up with my bf because I find myself attracted to this new guy.

We continued to go out as friends for a few months after my breakup. We got together as I slowly moved on from my breakup. 

We've been together for 3 years and we're currently planning for our big day in next year march. 

Don't ever settle for a mediocre relationship. If you find yourself wanting to go out with other guys, you're probably with the wrong person. 

Throughout these 3 years, there were a few guys asking me out here and there. I feel flattered by all the attention but I never once wanted to go out with any of them no matter how attractive and eligible they are. 

When you meet the right person, you wouldn't want to go out with anyone else anymore. When you're with the right one, you just know there's no other place you rather be."

63118,Hello i'm the one behind #63118. Thank you guys so much for your comments ???????????? can i just add on that he had had a few exes (about 6 to be exact) and he's my first love. That's why i feel so insecure whenever i'm with him because i feel like i have a lot to be compared to. And it seems like he was able to do so many things for his exes that he is now unable to do for me. It just feels like he is not loving me in the best way he can esp since this is my first relationship and he doesnt have anyone to measure up to. Like...I'm a hopeless romantic and i have seen him be romantic with his ex so it's not like he's not a romantic person but...?? I mean he does stuff when i ask but never voluntarily? Is this just a normal relationship growing up phase? Sigh...
63117,"Hi #63097, my bf is also a poly dropout. I met him during poly orientation and we started dating awhile after. He dropped out after a year and got enlisted while I went to uni after poly.

He decided to drop out because no matter how hard he studied, he was still failing most of his modules. Apparently, he just wasn't academically inclined. 

He then enlisted in army and his army friend recommended him to work as a waiter at his friend's father's restaurant during the weekend. 

After finishing army, out of an interest in cooking, he did a part-time course at a culinary school while continuing his part-time waiter job. Upon finishing the course, he worked as an apprentice at a restaurant. 

He worked very hard and took many part-time courses and participated in competitions along the way. He slowly worked his way up from apprentice to head chef. 

He then went on to work at a five star hotel as a junior chef and recently got promoted to sous chef, which pays him more than what I earn as an accountant.

It took him many years of hardwork to get to where he is now. It's definitely way harder for someone without paper qualifications to find a job that pays well. But as long as you're willing to constantly improve yourself and prove yourself to be worthy, there would always be a place for you to shine. 

Success is not determined by how much paper qualifications or how many A's you've got. It's your attitude that determines your success."
63114,"Went for scholarship interview, seems like people are hiring only for management position,should i worry in the future as a fresh grad without a cca portfolio with leadership area?"
63112,"I will be having my internship at one of the ministries (office environment) and I am quite worried about what I should be wearing. 20 y/o, female, but I'm quite a plain jane. For me it's just jeans+tshirt most of the time, with 0 makeup. Any advice on what kind of outfit and make up a female intern like me should be wearing would be very much appreciated. TIA :)"
63111,"Say goodbyeeee. Say goodbye -e-eye, eye-e-eye.

Best place to study, where you don't have to beat the crowd in utown. You have a nice table, computer and chair to yourself. Can also print all your notes for an open book exam there. 

Thanks for the past 3.5 years of support. Like Technoedge, I will remember you dearly as part of my favourites throughout my years here.


Sian, last semester must find other place to study liao."
63110,"To the OP of #63089, I can totally relate to what you've gone through. Teaching was my childhood ambition and I have always wanted to teach (as my first and last career, since secondary school). Like you, I was particularly inspired by my secondary school History teacher and JC form teacher. Hence, I applied to join MOE after my As. I even kept a promotional material I took from MOE when they came down to my school in Sec Four to remind me of this ambition I had.

I applied to MOE over a span of 4 years. During the first year, the interview was good, but I never heard from the HR side. One day, in August, I decided to call them up after 4 months (my interview was around March/ April) and it was then that they told me I was rejected.

In the second year I applied, I was rejected again.

After NS, I decided to try a teaching internship. It was an amazing experience which confirmed my love for teaching. Thankfully, I was also blessed with very supportive teacher mentors who affirmed my aptitude and passion for the profession. I applied to join MOE for the third time, but unfortunately, was rejected.

The last time I decided to apply, I felt very hesistant. After all, failing thrice made me question whether my childhood dream would really materialise. During the interview, the panelists asked why do I want to teach and I just candidly shared that I had a passion, did an internship which reinforced my love for teaching, and that this was my fourth time trying. They were shocked and asked if I knew why I was rejected. Like you, I didn't have the reasons, although I told them I wish I knew so that I could improve on my performance. I guess this persistence paid off, and I am omw to join the force that I once aspired to join as a kid.

I share with you my personal anecdote to reassure you that others also face similar experiences but have emerged from it stronger, and so can you. It is always very nice to hear of teachers who have inspired their students like you, who in turn want to inspire a future generation of Singaporeans. I am sure perseverance pays off. And so long as you keep trying and not give up, you'll definitely, definitely see light at the end of the tunnel :). Cheers."
63109,"I feel so silly waiting for some warmth from someone so logical that I know he can't give it. Yet I'm lying here awake, though I gotta get up early tomorrow morning, hoping to receive a text to tell me I'm loved and appreciated."
63107,"how does one deal with the realism of adulting? i used to be a student athlete, but facing graduation in a few months, i don't know what to do, as i'm not that great of a athlete that i will be headhunted to join clubs outside of NUS for sports leagues unlike some of my friends, but at the same time, i don't really want to hang up my boots just yet....it pains me sadly that i have to retire from the sporting scene greatly..."
63100,"I am from electrical engineering. After seeing #63040, there was something bugging me and I kept returning to stare at the post and comments. I was doubtful of myself and even did research to confirm my suspicions. I don't know how to put this across, but I just need to get it off my chest. So here goes.

The plural of pokemon is pokemon. There's no such thing as pokemons. Thanks. :)"
