56285,"To the (i’m assuming) pharmacy students of #56285 and #56287, I was in the same position as you, except I was from archi.

I always thought that working long hours, staying up overnight to do my work meant that I was working hard. And I had the exact same thoughts as you. Everyone seems less stressed,  do less but scored well. I felt that it was unfair, but looking back and reflecting, I hated my work, hated archi, and it translate to my work being subpar.

I didn’t even know what I was doing in archi, other than the fact that my parents thought it was all so good and prestigious. The first half of the course I was struggling so hard. My cap was below 3.0, which couldn’t be helped because I keep getting C+ or C for our core mod of 8mc, (only got a B- once).

In the later half of the course, when we had time for UEs and the option to drop our core mod, I explored and found mods that I actually really enjoy studying. I didn’t even need long hours or overnighting to study because I really liked it. 

Thanks to that, I managed to pull up my cap from a pass to a third lower, and I was really really happy. You don’t need a first class to be happy, everyone has their own goals! You can only be happy if you stop comparing.

After going to summer school and taking UEs to explore my interest, I’m out of archi and doing something I actually like in a different industry. 

Don’t worry so much right now! There are a lot of people in similar situations. I had a cousin do a career switch in his 30s and there were also policies that can subsidise your learning in another field. WSQ or something. Keep pressing on! "

56242,"#56224 It amazes me that many people are so willing to believe an article that is so incredibly one-sided. They interviewed a bunch of (5) disgruntled ex-staffs who complain that they didn’t get on with the new head, framing it as though the new head is at fault. Did they not consider that maybe the new head was implementing changes to solve deep-rooted problems which these staffs may have been a part of? These staff resigning cos they did not like what the new head was doing does not mean that this head was wrong. Going to a journalist and bad-mouthing your previous place of employment like this reflects poorly on these staff members and frankly leads me to think that they may be quite difficult people to deal with.

Furthermore, they contacted a lot of these disgruntled staff but never even thought to interview the current staff? The vast majority of staff chose to stay (at least 25 according to the dept website). Shouldn’t this journalist have asked them why they stayed and what they think of the changes to the department? There isn’t even a single comment from current staff. Bertha Henson still works there and she said on Facebook that they didn’t reach out to her.

Also, the claims made in the article about modules being discontinued seem misleading. For instance, it claims that ‘news reporting and editing’ is discontinued, when Bertha Henson said on her Facebook that she would be teaching it next year. NM2220 Intro to media writing is also being taught next sem. The article also say that photography mod is discontinued. Looking at CORS, there are TWO photography mods offered next sem, NM3230 and NM4231. The article also mentions that at a focus group, students had complained about mods that “overlapped in content”. Perhaps the photography mod being deleted was one that overlapped with the existing photo mods that are already being taught? Do we really need 3 photo mods a sem? Without actually having the full ‘Curriculum Review’ paper that this journalist has, there’s no way to know how honestly he is framing the changes, or whether he is pushing an agenda as suggested by his one-sided interviews.

As for there being concerns about there ‘not being enough mods to graduate’, I looked at the numbers on CORS. There are 40+ undergrad mods offered next sem. There are also 40+ mods offered by sociology and psychology. It’s a perfectly normal number. The fearmongering is unjustified.

Overall, I find it amazing that this type of sensationalist, one-sided article was the top story on Today. Many of the same people who complain about the mainstream media seem to be all too happy to gobble this story up though!

56240,hi any thoughts on GEH1006

56237,"Found this folder on my bf's external HDD containing nudes his exes/flings/whatnot have sent him. Last accessed was probably a long time ago, though there were quite a few different girls in there, his more recent exes were conspicuously missing.

I'm not sure what to think. I know he's moved on, and I know he probably didn't remember the existence of this folder when he lent me the HDD (our project files are on it and they're quite large so he just passed the whole HDD to me for the afternoon).

56232,"Advice please. How much should I work? 

I applied for scholarship but failed. Hence I work part-time to pay for my school fees, food and bills. I actually have earned enough to be able to pay for tuition and my own allowance for the next few years. 

However, there is a conflict of interest. My work and my study are at direct conflict with each other. The more time I spend on working, the less time I have on studying. The more time I spend on working, the more money I earn. Vice versa. 

I make about at least a dozen k or more a month when I put in effort. Hence it's close to impossible for me to give up working totally and become a 24/7 student. 

Last semester, I spent 80% of my free time working and the rest 20% on school work. During recess week, I would spend like 8 hours working and 2 hours studying. I couldn't concentrate on studying because I could have spent the hours making a few hundred /thousand bucks. The opportunity cost is too high. I got a CAP of low 4.1X, which is Distinction. Call me lucky because the modules I took last semester were mostly easy. Had I spent all my time studying, I have no slightest doubt that I would have gotten at least 4.6X CAP. 

I'm afraid that in the next few semesters, I might have to take more and tougher modules. If I continue to ""slack"" in my studies like that, my CAP might drop below 4.0 to Merit or worse. 

I'm studying an Arts degree. The prospect of fresh graduates from my course getting even a third of what I'm making is dull enough. 

I want to graduate with a good degree, I also want to graduate rich. Should I sacrifice grades for money or should I sacrifice money for grades? And how much should I sacrifice?

1) ""We have been actively engaging Y3 and Y4 students in focus groups discussions regarding the curriculum revisions.""

Plus, you arrange that one last min just before exams- don't count ok. How many could attend b4 exams? very smart hor.
2) ""The proposed revisions will provide students with clearer industry specialisation pathways to equip you with industry relevant skills and enable you to be adaptable when you join the workforce.""
Right. Hence, our modules are more and more theoretical and specialised/practical ones from IMD disappeared. Come, I clap for u. 
I suspect the new HOD has never worked outside academia, so thinks theory is king. issit huh. It is not, hor. In fact, no one cares about theories ok. i took an internship and those theories did nothing for me. ktks.

56214,"To #56166: Good that you realised early that you want to leave the profession. However, since you're already in your 3rd year, focus on graduating with good grades (if not, at least show an improvement...a good employer should overlook any crappy grades from the past as long as you can perform). Do your pre-reg if you still want a foot back into the profession in future, or if you still need time to think about your next step. Or even an internship with a pharma company before you cross out those who have 'gone over to the dark side'. There are loads of options in industry if you care to explore - regulatory, patent work, sale/marketing ($$$), health econs/market access, research, etc. If this is still not your thing, start planning for an alternative non-pharmacy-related career in your area of interest. Learn coding (good for healthcare analytics), take biz modules (good for finance jobs), etc. 

Through the grapevine I've heard that many pharmacy grads have gone into medicine, research, finance, aviation, business, teaching, etc. However, most do not wish to be affliated with pharmacy and are not open about their undergrad training. That's why you rarely hear about such characters. If you calculate the number of pharmacy graduates from NUS and subtract the number of actual pharmacists employed by all the retail outlets/hospitals (not just those holding a licence), you have a rough idea of the hundreds who are no longer practicing. 

Yes, most pharmacy students tend to be med school rejects, who either come from low/middle-class families and don't speak eloquently enough to pass a med school interview. No guanxi with good grades in SG can be a somewhat of a hindrance in a meritocratic society as you can see. But that's life, and you gotta make the best of your circumstances. If you really want to be a doctor, explore other alternatives overseas and learn the foreign languages or save up if needed. You don't necessary have to attend a recognised med school unless you absolutely have to return to SG. Also, it may be that pharmacy practice abroad (eg. US, Aust) may carry more meaning for you so try to explore your options and acquire the necessary qualifications to practice there.

Whatever your choice, you're lucky you realised what you do not want to do early in your career, as opposed to after 5 years of practice. So, get off your ass now and follow your dreams. And remember to encourage your classmates and juniors who feel disheartened about their path...it's a long journey and a big big world out there..."

Dear sir/mdm,

I would like to give suggestion here regarding on giving students an option for the best grading system of their choice for every single module in the tertiary education. This way, they can get to choose the best option that matchup with their strengths so to pass all modules, without people keeps criticizing the education system of being unfair, tough, outdated, all about grades and expecting one size fits all. In fact, tertiary education shouldn’t test us with written exams any more as it is more of hands on and work related. Module review/diary/reflections will be a small section of the module that is about essay writing, this will ask us to write out our thoughts about the module. How to improve the module? what we learnt? What can we improve with the knowledge that we learnt?

•Exam based: exam 70%, attendance 10%, class participation 10% and module review/diary/reflections 10%.

•Attachment based: attachment 70%, attendance 10%, class participation 10% and module review/diary/reflections 10%.

•Projects/assignment based: 35% each for both group work and individually projects, total 70%. attendance 10%, class participation 10% and module review/diary/reflections 10%."
