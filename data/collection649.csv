64998,Do you have bad managers or seniors who don't involve you in projects? They will leave the trivial stuffs for you to handle while they spend their time on valuable things. How do I reject them? By changing jobs?
64997,"Why is everyone so happy about the recent rankings? IMO, many are hypocritical when they admire the rankings but shunned NUS for the recent exodus of profs (citing things like NUS was too focused on rankings and citations rather than teaching). Sure, NUS has high rank in QS but does this necessarily mean better teaching for our students? I strongly believe that the education received by students is more important than things like international student representation, academic reputation, and even citations/research. This QS thing is really something that we should take with a pinch of salt and look past, into finer things (with most emphasis on) like welfare and education of students and employability. I still remember when NTU took over for a brief year and the whole of SG went bonkers. Now no one gives two hoots about that. Really, now that cambridge has dipped to 7th, no one really cared. So maybe, if the profs just focused on giving their students the best education they can, then can we say we have learnt something from school. I think that is what truly matters. Stop the paper chase."
64996,"@64973: this is an area that the ladies have an advantage: you got douches and Vagisil. They don't advertise these to us. We get deodorant adverts that fooled guys into thinking they don't need to shower. After living with my gf, I realised how life changing Vagisil (or other feminine washes) is: it doesn't burn when it hits a mucosal membrane (soap does). So you can ""really"" clean it. Some even have mild fragrances so now mine smell ... like my gf's.

Another thing I found out after living with a woman: lotions. My skin is now silky smooth and I smell like a walking bouquet of flowers. It helped that I moved to a country with dry winters. Without lotion, the winter is absolute hell: your skin dries out and you get itchy the whole time.

Combe Incorporated produces Vagisil advertised to women, and hair dyes for men. You really screwed us over. You could have saved millions of men from being called stinky if you advertised ""Penisil"" or something."
64994,"Everyone thinks that im a very well liked person and that I’m leading a very good life always. But what they do not know is how I have issues with my sexuality, having to deal with so much awkward things in life. I feel upset at times when i get to reflect about this, and thats why i am evergreen  but no one ever suspects why"
64993,"#64993, I beg to differ. For my gf and me, we like to do it in the shower. Heat of the moment for us haha. I guess it really depends on the persons involved."
64991,Anyone knows if I could get root canal treatment done by dentistry students? and how much it would cost?
64990,"Hi seniors, im contemplating between applying for BSc Data Science Analytics or Economics. Which one will be in higher demand in the short and long run? Are there key differences between the two in terms of studies and career?

I personally love economics but I have come to learn about the booming field of data science. Really appreciate your advice. Will be great if Prof Ben Leong gives his opinion as well :)"
64988,"I’m op of #64988 and #65039. Just want to clarify my previous posts.

A and b are females, c and d are males. I am a. My female friend is b, by right she shares the same room with me on this overseas trip. And by right c and d share another room. We are on overseas vacation now, so none of this is happening in sg, let alone in the hostel on campus. Now, b has abandoned me, and is having a fwb relationship with c. B went over to c’s room and that’s where I hear the moaning sounds come from. Concurrently, d got kicked out of his room temporarily because of b and c’s activities, then d came over to my room. That’s one of the times d became flirty with me, even suggestive at times. I suspect d wants to be fwb with me, so I’m asking should I? I’m quite open to these sort of things.

P.s. I’m not a troll, it’s just that I’m not that good in expressing myself in words."
64987,"Does anyone have any recommendations on how to pick up tennis? Shall I join tennis classes, or is there any cheaper options?"
64986,"I think educated people are easy to brainwash. Firstly, they study to be good at a specific field. But not necessarily think about politics or human motivations. Secondly, they are egoistic and pressured to conform to the group thinking. If you think differently from your professors or peers, you might risk being wrong."
64985,"Hello. I'm extremely saliva conscious and I am wondering for other fellow saliva conscious people out there, how do you kiss??

A light peck seems okay but, the thought of french kiss creeps me out. How do I overcome this fear?"
64981,"I hv similar problem to #64981. But we r not that advanced in our relationship yet, only a few dates. Haven’t started holding her hand, because idk if she refuses. I remember another offence under the recently released sexual assault report is something like “touching the hand without permission”. If I ask for permission it’s v awkward, if I don’t I may get subjected to disciplinary action. Should I pick the lesser of two evils?"
64979,"Hi, anyone can share more insights about the difference between credit bearing and non-credit bearing internships? 

From what I understand, credit bearing internships require a supervisor from the faculty, reports/ presentations at certain milestones and a CS/CU grade will be given at the end based on components such as employer's evaluation. Non-credit bearing internships on the other hand have a stronger resemblance to work? (with some learning objectives)

If I don't require any additional credits (and a credit bearing internship is not compulsory for my programme), would there be any incentives or value to do a credit bearing internship?"
64977,Anyone who is overweight (say Bmi > 28) who could find a partner to get attached? Really worried for myself because I been overweight all my life.

64974,"Hello, I recently called off my wedding with my ex fiancé due to some arguments. Was told by some of my friends about a post circulating on NUSWhispers which bears high resemblance to my situation. I believe the OP of #64974 and #65116 is my ex fiancé. I just want to share my side of the story.

Yes, it’s true that my ex fiancé got a pay rise recently and that ended up with her pay being higher than mine. But what happened was after her pay rise, I saw a side of her that I never noticed before. She became arrogant, controlling, and bossy. She acted like a know it all. She treated me as if I was a beggar who needed her to feed me. When we’re out with our friends, she acted as if she was the boss and I was her subordinate. When you’re treated like her subordinate when in reality you’re not, how can you not lose face?

Now that I’ve seen her post on NUSWhispers, i can be even more certain that I made the right decision to call off the wedding. I saw one of her posts which called me childish. Well let me say she is the real childish one. Why is she so childish that she has to go onto such an anonymous forum to rant, instead of communicating directly with me? If my future wife is this type of person who will stab me the back and complain about everything we disagree on by ranting anonymously online, then of course I would call off the wedding!

If anyone wants to say that I’ve drooped to as low as her by posting this post anonymously online, let me say to them this: I myself am only commenting here because I want to give everyone here the other side of the story. And also to warn others against falling into the situation that I’m in now.  To those guys out there, these type of women are toxic. If you ever come across this type of women, LEAVE HER AT ALL COSTS."
64973,"Guys who don’t cut off their foreskin should really think about their gf. It’s a hygienic issue. Even if you wash your foreskin Everyday, it still stinks. Pls be more considerate. Just saying."
64972,"My gf was having an argument with me yesterday because she felt she wasn’t getting enough attention from me than before. She said was breaking up with me immediately. She even blocked my social media and phone number on the spot. She deleted all out Instagram photos. But today she regretted saying what she said & say she wants to still stay with me. We have been together since secondary 3. Should I give her another chance or is should I just end this here? Part of me feels that I have just seen a side of her I never saw before, which is the extreme anger and lack of self control when she’s emotional."
64971,I have been having sex with my bf for one and a half years now. We’ve been together for 3 years. But one thing is he refuses to remove his condom even though I have taken contraceptive pills on my part. He also refuses to finishes off without withdrawing. Is it that he doesn’t trust me enough?
64969,"Nus should get rid of webcasts. Causes so few people to attend lectures. If there is no webcast n u wan recording for ur own revision, just attend the lecture urself and tape it. Like that wont waste the prof effort, no need them to give lecture to empty lt."

64960,"Crushing on this girl and i just want to get over this shit. Don't care if we end up in a r/s or not at this stage.

Should I approach and talk it out or bury it within me and let it maybe die over time? Problem is we are in the same clique and will probably see each other weekly for the next 2 years. But this crushing thing is really affecting my thoughts and normal life."
64958,"So I’ve finally found my clique in NUS and i must say, we click like Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet.

We share the same hobbies, quirky banter, sense of humour etc. But recently, after months of hanging out there was a revelation. Everyone in the clique was comfortably affluent.

Normally this wouldn’t change the way i behave or the the way i treat them as I am quite comfortable myself. But i don’t know anymore, lately i find myself sharing their habits of impulsive and excessive shopping of luxury goods. I find myself indulging in brands like D&G, YSL, Goyard etc and even considered buying a car and it has really taken a toll on not only my wallet but my studies as well.

Frivolous events like collaborations between brands, limited edition items have eclipsed the information given by my professors and i don’t feel worried in the least.

I know the logical solution would be to distance myself from them but... i can’t describe how at ease and cordial i am when im with them. I love them. But i think this is making impressionable me into something disgusting. 

What do i do, it’s not their fault, they dont pressure me into doing anything. I just feel like a white canvas that can be dyed any colour."
64957,"My bf is very calculative in terms of money he spends on our date. Not that he not willing to spend, but he keeps track of every single cent he spends from the start of our relationship.

64956,"I’m an engineering student. Nus should just invest some money to build a lrt system to resolve the problem of crowded shuttle buses for once and for all.

64941,"It might sound silly but this is what happened. I got convinced and persuaded to join the financial advisory line (while still studying). I guess I was attracted by the remuneration and flexible working hours. I am under a mentor who seems to be rather open and great in the beginning. I passed all the examinations to meet the requirements and got my license with MAS. Everything happened so quickly during my last semester. I realised that my mentor might not be who I thought he was from the start. He seems to be sales oriented and has a paternalistic leadership style. He can listen to you and make you feel like he understands you but at the end of the day, he doesn’t even consider my opinions and choices that I would like to make for myself. I am caught at the crossroad now. I have signed this form with Prudential where they say I have to compensate $1k to get an ipad and $500 if I am unable to sell 4 cases within 3 months. Do anyone happen to know if I can just quit without paying and getting the ipad? Or do anyone have any useful advices? Thanks in advance!"
64939,"Looking at #64927’s post, Im very triggered that we’re still using paper straws in the canteen. Look, paper straws are also disposable, are they environmentally friendly? I concede that they are relatively more environmentally friendly than plastic straws because they can biodegrade. But still it harms the environment.

Really ridiculous that we are changing from one item that is not environmentally friendly (plastic straw) to another that is also not environmentally friendly (paper straw) - both are single use items. Makes people feel that we eliminated plastic straws as a PR stunt, and not because we really care for the environment

That’s why I fully support OP’s suggestion to introduce a price on paper straws. 50 cents or 1 dollar would be a good price to start. We should all just drink from the cup directly. As for those ppl who want their bubble tea with pearls should just bring their own metal straws or pay up for the straws.

I really hope that the relevant ppl in charge think about this."

64933,"Op of #64933 here

TLDR of #64933: I fell in love with one of my best friends, who is happily attached. Our personalities, interests and even food preferences matched like lock and key, we never ran out of things to talk about, and I feel she totally understands me. Because of this, I wanted to draw the line, and maintain the friendship, but failed and ended up crossing the line multiple times. In the end, I decided to ghost her, and cut her out completely from my life because I felt it was the best for both of us.

Recently, I found out from one of our mutual friends that she broke up. From this friend's account, she was very affected by the ghosting, and got into a fight with her boyfriend because of this. Apparently, she developed feelings for me too.

When I heard about this, I was mildy delighted (cmon, we are all selfish people). At the same time, I was consumed with guilt. Firstly for being the 3rd party in a relationship. Secondly for cutting her out so abruptly and causing her stress. Previously, the right choice was obvious. Now that the situation has changed, I really don't know what to do anymore.

Any genuine advice would be appreciated."
64932,"Hello, I need some advice here.

I'm currently studying in a local university right now and my boyfriend is holding a full time job.

My secondary school mates are going to hold a get-together soon and encourages all to bring their partner along.

I'm quite hesitant to bring along my boyfriend as he is an engineer at Bentley and holds an ITE higher nitec cert only. On the other hand, all my classmates boyfriends are working white collar jobs and holds a degree.

I'm afraid that the others will judge my boyfriend and I and I'm really really hesitant to bring him over."
64929,"Hey everyone, I need some help:

I am an international student at NUS, who has just graduated. My phone was stolen around 1.5 weeks ago from the lounge of a residential college in NUS (the door was locked), by one of the security personnel (he was caught on CCTV). The police found the phone within a week, but are holding onto it because they want to use it as evidence to the charge the person in question. I asked the police how long they want to hold onto it for, and they said a few months. When I told them that I need my phone to live my daily life, that I would be leaving Singapore in 2 months, and that it was unreasonable for me to buy a new phone given that it had been found, they said they would see what they could do. Today, they told me that they are waiting for ""concurrence from the Attorney General's chambers"", and that the process could take up to a month or longer. I asked them if they could drop the charges, and they said that wouldn't be possible. I asked them if they could release the SIM card or if I could get a few hours with the phone to to get my data, and they said neither of those would be possible either. I really need my phone back to live my daily life (can’t access WhatsApp, any account with 2FA, or take calls), and as a student I would really prefer not to have to spend hundreds of dollars on a new phone and SIM when I’m definitely going to get them back. If you can help, or know somebody who can, please say so in the comments, and I’ll reach out. Thanks!"

64916,"My dog just died in my old house. 

I actually haven’t been back home for a few years, main reason being my parents in their 60s split up and my mum ended up moving out. They did that right after I’ve completed my degree as they claimed that they didn’t want their decision to interfere with my studies. I’ve never set foot in my home again as I could never bear the feeling of stepping into a broken home, it feels very overwhelming and I would get very worked up inside and couldn’t express it. 

I spent the last few years renting outside, and now I just got a text from my dad saying my dog who has been with me since I was in secondary school died. I’ve taken care of her since she was a puppy and she had been my solace everytime something bad happened to me, everytime my parents fought I would bring her to my room and play with her, which is pathetic I know but she is sort of my friend. 

I feel very depressed and partially guilty as I was afraid that my dog thought that I had abandoned her for the last few years. I’m not expecting words of comfort nor seeking attention here, just trying to vent my frustrations..."
