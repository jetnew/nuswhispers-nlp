61399,"Hi, I have a doubt. 

I am really curious how the graduation ceremony will be held for the graduating students. Will the students from each cohort be ranked according to their CAP class (1st class; 2nd class; 3rd class) to get their certificate on stage? Or will it be just the top scorers being recognised? 

I am really embarrassed with my CAP and I wouldn't want my friends to know which class I am in..

61395,"I am really quite upset at the mentality of fellow students recently. Instead of listening to the lecturer and learning new things, all they could ask was ""would this come up in finals?"" As much as everyone emphasize on grades, myself included, I just really feel that this is not how our education system should be, especially when we are at the university level and preparing ourselves for the workforce. With this 'study for exams' mentality, are we going to ask our bosses or employers questions like ""would this affect my appraisal?"" as well? "

61389,"Why is it that companies can afford to have candidates to seat through 4-5 rounds of interviews? I have rejected recruiters for DS/DA positions because it appears to me that the HR seem to be unable to exercise some commonsense that people like us are currently working and do not have the luxury/enough leave to entertain their client and seat through the whole process. If it were me, I would guess those positions are meant for fresh grads because they have time to seat through it."

61384,Hi all. Can someone help me understand why do profs always say that assignment questions are very short but in actual fact each question consists of 10 parts to it? It's week 12 and I'm dying.. help this poor soul please.. :( 
61380,"With regards to the discussion on MA2101, I think that it is really undeniable that Prof Zhang is really a nice, polite, humble and dedicated teacher. We all can see his passion and good insights on the subject his is teaching and also his desire to impart all these to the students. But let's be fair and separate the two issues. Being nice has really got nothing to do with how well you teach and handle the course.

I am someone who had followed him for two modules in two semesters. I really appreciate his good characters as mentioned above but as for the subject content itself I would rather say that it really does not meet the expectation set by the course itself and it is really disappointing for someone who wishes to gain more from this kind of supposedly enlightening course, apart from those things that can be learnt through self study. 


Yes to some people there might not be an issue to go through the lectures, look at the examples and computations he does in class and do well in the exam. Some people would be satisfied and think ""they learn"". However, to others this might not be the expectation of ""learning"" in this course. For people in math, you would realize that modules like fundamentals, linear algebra and analysis etc are really the foundations that provide a framework and overarching structure. And of course this course is set with the clear goal of theoretical rigour and proof techniques. I would rather agree with the opinion that Prof Zhang really needs to think about how he can deliver the messages you wish to bring across better.

All in all, it is really a matter of persepctive and what you wish to get out of the course.

To Prof Zhang if you are reading this:
You are really very nice. Please be sure that we are not trying to be mean or picky to say all these. But if there are things that can be improve on, why not?

61379,"Saw my ex at the gym with his gf and friends. Wanted to go up to his new girl to warn her off him, and was gathering the nerve to go up to tell her throughout. Didn't help that they set themselves up close to me, not sure if that was intentional on his part of he just didn't notice me there.

When he separated from them and they started to leave, I walked up close to his current girlfriend, ready to tell her all about him... promptly lost the nerve, and walked out of the gym awkwardly.

I guess he might have changed in the meantime, he seems really different. I don't think it's my place to judge who he is anymore, and even though some posts here encourage warning the girl off, maybe it's really none of my business. They deserve a shot at it at least, and I'd be ruining a perfectly good relationship if he really did change in the meantime.

Don't poison the well just cause you can't drink from it.

To my ex, I wish you well, though I guess we're strangers again. "

I'm the OP of #61241.
Sorry to hear your dissatisfaction with the hearts you've gotten.
I guess part of it was contributed by your 'ultra specific, high requirements':
- is simple (not constantly catching up with the latest fashion or splurging on unnecessary items) 
- eats a meal without taking 100000 pics 
- has her own opinions and able to banter with me
- exercises and takes care of her body
- gives me a big smile/hug whenever she sees me
- is adventurous (in all aspects :p) 
- is kind to animals and people around her
- is able to enjoy herself even when she is involved in smth that requires sweat and hard work
- is street smart and able to navigate herself through any situation
- is able to maintain cordial relations with my family and understand that they are the priority in my life

Your filters might have deterred some girls... 
I'm also suspecting if I can heart your post confidently. 
It's self explanatory so I wouldn't elaborate on why.

Regarding your proposal, I'm afraid I have to reject it. 
I stated my filters, but please allow me to confess that they are not all. 
Your criticism on our sis code didn't land a favorable impression...
I hope you could find someone else more suitable for you.

Lastly, would like to indicate my appreciation for everyone who hearted my post or advocated your friends. I was both surprised and elated by the number. I am trying my best figure out who to pm.

61374,"To #61374: I feel that yours is the majority opinion, but only the minority who feel injustice will complain about mods, is this not inverse survivorship bias, when we only hear from the people who have not 'survived'? 

People who did well in algo mods in retrospect started earlier (maybe even secondary school), do you really think people are going to just show hand and tell everyone that they were already mugging for codejam? Reality is that it's not going to get easier, you have to work smarter and leetcode harder. To evaluate effort at scale, perhaps it is necessary to incentivise demonstrable effort. I guess this applies to interviews as well. If you want to go OCS, yet never pass IPPT, a bit hard. But if you start training 3 months before, maybe can get gold also. Oh CS, once upon a time TC and prestige was low, but people still trained like mad and it was fun, sort of.

Sometimes the signal is in what's not there, the secrets that are hard-won, that are found from talking to real people who work hard, before it's post on blind or NUSWhispers. Envy and resentment are not useful emotions, these warnings have been passed down the generations, in the kind of books we strawberries may not read. Hopefully we are neither the cowards which never started, nor the weak that died along the way. "

61369,"to #61369: imo - you can search how to buy SGS govt bonds, or RSP regular savings plan, or open a brokerage account and buy low cost index funds / ETF.

You also reminded me of an article: https://jlcollinsnh.com/2011/06/08/how-i-failed-my-daughter-and-a-simple-path-to-wealth/

1. Avoid fiscally irresponsible people.  Never marry one or otherwise give him access to your money.
2. Avoid money managers. It’s your money and no one will care for it better than you. 
3. Avoid debt. 
4. Save a portion of every dollar you get.
5. The greater the percent of your income you save and invest, the sooner you’ll have F-You money.  Try 50%.  With no debt, this perfectly doable.
6. Put this money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) This is the fund you already own, so just keep adding to it (in USA context - but you can buy this / similar low cost index funds through overseas exchange through your brokerage, or robinhood if you have)
7. Realize the market and the value of your shares will sometimes drop dramatically.  People all around you will panic.  They’ll be screaming Sell, Sell, Sell.  Ignore this.  Even better:  Buy more shares. 
8. When you can live off the dividends VTSAX provides you are financially free.
9. The less you need, the more free you are.

I'm just glad that we graduated and even though we are in the same uni now, we don't see each other ever since A level results release last year. Continue to stay away from my sight, I dont want to see you neither do I want to hear your name mentioned. Don't ever talk to me. Dont ever take the same modules as me.

People from his time probably can't even comprehend the stuff we know and see today. We had photographed something that would take lifetimes to reach even if we travel at the speed of light. We had sent probes into the outer edges of our solar system. Manned exploration of nearby celestial bodies are happening in less than a decade from now. There's so much mystery in the cosmos that we as a human species had only unravel the tip of the iceberg. When I look into the sky, I get reminded that I am but an insignificant speck of dust on a rock whizzing through space.

You've been very generous with extending datelines as well. I enjoy your lectures as you I can feel your passion for teaching. I know that our cohort has been tough to manage but prof, i hope you know that there are actually many students out there among the 700 students who understand you, those that have been making negative remarks on NUSWhispers are the minority.

I personally know another guy who spends only five minutes on maths homework and not worrying about exams. I think that’s quite cool and isn’t not sweating about the next homework or test a good feeling?

61355,"How does one confess to the guy/girl they like without making the friendship awkward should there be a rejection? Is that possible?

I've been thinking about this for quite a while now. There's a friend I've been crushing on for about 2-ish months now, and we're pretty decent friends (from my POV). He's a really matured and fun but a wise person that brings people comfort when you talk to him (online, since he's currently not in school because of SEP) and I enjoy chatting with him.

It seems like a real dead case because we haven't spent a lot of time together before he left, and from how he speaks in a more social environment, he doesn't seem to see me that way? (Or should I spend more time hanging out with him when I can after he comes back?)

One of the biggest fear of confession is probably the fact that it could ruin any friendship between the two people, so I was wondering if there's any way to confess without ruining the friendship. I wanted to try the April's Fool method, but I figured not to. Ultimately, even if he doesn't see me this way, I want to keep this friendship. He's a friend I treasure dearly and I don't want to lose him just because of an unmatched feeling I have for him."

It's a course designed for ppl with non-IT background to have a career switch. I realize that what I am learning is quite broad but not in depth.

If you are a current 2030 student, I hope you can say something encouraging either face to face or via email. If you are one of those people who ranted on whispers about him, I hope you reflect from this and have the decency to apologize to him face to face. Dr Henry Chia is a good person and he deserved so much more than this."
61346,"Math Department please look into MA2101. MA2101 is such a nightmare this semester, not that it is hard and I can't take it. 

I believe that we all need to take English tests and pass or excel to certain levels to get into university and we as science students need to take SP1431 also. Why then does someone teaching a module alone can't even form a single complete sentence that is unbroken and grammatically correct? Go and watch the webcast and you will see how terrible it is. 

Math is so delicate and this is a theory course. Even the use of word ""the"" requires a proof of uniqueness and yet the lecturer uses it so haphazardly. And how amazing it is that the lecturer can't even pronounce and spell basic mathematical terms correctly. e.g. ""polynomial"" is always pronounced as ""polynominal"", ""subtraction"" is ""substraction"", ""2D-plane"" is spelled and pronounced as ""2D-plan"", etc. He can't talk with clarity, let alone explain concepts and teach a theoretical course on Linear Algebra.

Again, people might say we should be independent learners. But, I didn't say I am not learning it independently or I can't learn independently. I am saying, he is not doing his job properly. These are two completely different stories. Math dept, it is such a pity to turn away people who are still interested in such dry realms of thereotical math in this era. "
61343,"I personally think that Prof. Chia had been doing a really good job for the module CS2030. I am not saying that this module is perfect. There are definitely a lot of things that can be improved. It is unfair to rant about Prof. Chia as if he had been doing a bad job. I believe he had been very supportive to the students taking this course. In terms of workload, it is definitely not light, but for this module, I believe the deadline for the assignments are quite okay. In terms of practical exam, I do admit that it was quite tough. I am not saying this because I could do the exam well. I could not even pass level 1 for the second practical. I am not sure how others do for this practical. In my opinion, I do think that the question is difficult to understand. I personally could not even understand what the question wanted us to do. This explains why I could not even pass level 1. Personally, I do think that for the second practical assessment, the question should have been much clearer. It would have been better if it was clear. I myself could not understand the question and there was no way I could think of how to solve the question in the first place. However, it is UNFAIR if anyone complain that Prof. Chia is a bad prof simply because of this one practical. Just because of one unclear  practical (this is my opinion), how can you say that this prof is bad. I do hope that he could do something to help us understand the question, or rectify this problem. But, the practical has passed as well. I also do not think there is much he can do regarding the second practical. The only thing he could do now is perhaps only the grading/marking. I believe that he knows what he needs to do about this. He is a good prof. I just hope that people won't accuse him so badly without concrete base."
