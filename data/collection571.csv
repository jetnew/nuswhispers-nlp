57198,"#57198: To the few people defending the act of reserving seats: 
Allow me state the obvious - You are decreasing the total number of seats while you queue for your food. If no one reserves seats, more seats will be filled with people consuming their meal, and moving off after they are done. It is less likely that there will be a shortage of seats, even though the lunch crowd population is constant each day.

Reserving seats is inconsiderate, and comparing this practice with bad practices from other countries does not make it any less inconsiderate. Any sufficiently large group of humans will have good and bad practices, and correspondingly, good and bad people. I think it is time to get rid of this bad practice."
57196,"Being inclusive is one of the most fundamental forms of respect we can offer to those around us.

Belonging to one of the minority races, I received a rude shock upon entering NUS last year, having last experienced this only in primary school. I thought certain people from the majority race would have outgrown this to become more mature individuals with a good awareness of their surroundings. Unfortunately not so.

Initially, when I had groupmates speaking to each other in Mandarin I did not really take it very seriously, because they were mostly one to one conversations that I was not very keen to get involved in. However, during committee discussions when I was the only minority present, nearly half the discussions took place in Chinese. 

Of course I did think of reminding them of the presence of a non-Chinese. Amidst the boisterous chattering (all in Mandarin), however, I felt small. I hesitated, believing that my tiny voice would go unheard among the laughs and giggles. 

I do see that this is not done with racist intentions. I understand that certain parts of speech or humor can be conveyed more accurately and intensely in Mandarin as compared to English, because I experience it with my own mother tongue as well. But at the expense of offending others??

I am not saying that people should not speak in Chinese before me. But it would be respectful to just TRY to translate, if not, a simple apology would do as it shows us that you recognise and respect our presence. Is that so hard??

I am glad that I have not really experienced this from people within my major itself, but it is something that I suppose should be changed. Maybe it is not of much importance to the majority race since some of you may not even have experienced it. But it will definitely bring more joy to us, minorities."

Life has a way of making people suffer for the weirdest of things. What was supposed to bring joy and support, ended up turning into something that brought pain and emotional turmoil.

It sucks more that we are the ones that have to suffer the brunt of it.  I hope you're coping well. Or at least better than I am. While it pains to have this barrier, it's something I have to agree with you. We do need this. The constant suffocation was doing us both dirty and it's hightime we both did something about it. I don't deny the bitterness though. 

Hopefully, we can get over this stupid wall we've built for ourselves and come back stronger.

Till then,

57188,"Pardon me, my example is using the average Singaporean male as an example, but the same can be applied to females as well.

Given that:
- the average life expectancy is around 81 years old for males
- Singaporean males generally start working at around age 24
- the CPF contribution rate is around 32%

The average Singaporean male would work for 41 years until retirement at age 65.

Assuming that annual income is about 48,000, without any increment or bonus.
- Someone working 41 years would make around 1,968,000.
- Total CPF contribution would be around 629,760.

Now, assuming zero interest rate, and ignoring changing CPF contribution rate, and one spends all income earned excluding CPF.
- One would spend about 1,338,240 over 41 years; which is about 32,640 per year.

Assuming at retirement, someone spends 32,640 per year.
- CPF should be enough to cover at least 629,760 / 32,640 = 19 years.

If the CPF monthly payout age is at 65, the age when your CPF runs out of money is 84 years old.
Even without including interest, this is 3 years above the average life expectancy.

-------------

Note that my calculations are not overly optimistic or pessimistic, for example:
- You can use X as annual income (I used 4,000 a month as average).
  - As long as you are spending within your means, you are OK.

- CPF has a default 2.5% annual interest rate.
  - Using the example above, at the end of 41 years, the total amount in CPF would be around 1,088,648.
  - Or, in terms of years, you would be able to pay for 33 years of expenditure.

- By retirement, you should be able to own your HDB flat.
  - Thus, you would probably spend less after retirement.

Conclusion: there is no reason to increase the CPF payout age."

57184,"Yesterday morning I saw something truly terrifying. A guy riding an e-scooter slipped and fell near the CLB bus stop, and it sounded pretty bad given that I could hear it all the way from the IT bus stop opposite.

No, that wasn't the terrifying thing - no one in the immediate vicinity bothered to help him up or even ask him if he was okay. They all just kept staring while walking away, some even just ignored him and went back to staring at their phones while waiting for the bus. Truly terrifying.

57155,"The other side of the story #56983- 
It's true people catch feelings for another person while currently being attached. But have you ever been the bf/gf who completely trusts your partner, actively tries working on the relationship because you love them and yet, are kept in the dark by the same person you trusted and valued so much. This is even worse when your partner catches feelings for someone in your close friend circle and neither of them tell you anything. You find out the truth in the worst way possible- you find out that your friend had even proposed to your partner from other friends.

Well, this was me. I know it's understandable that people catch feelings for another while currently being attached. But my request to these people is that, if you respect your partner even a little bit and value their emotions, please open up to them. It's hard enough as it is to hear your partner likes someone else, but to find out about this from other people, it gets much more difficult to move on.

Recently found out that one of my close friends proposed to my gf and that she likes him and was leading him on. Seems like my whole world is crumbling down. Is it possible to move on?

All these is done because you know that your family - residing in a cramped rental flat somewhere in an infamous part of singapore - is relying on you to do well.

Of course, many people have different definitions of ""poor"" and maybe in their minds they fit the criteria. Yet, these people - knowingly or unknowingly - take advantage of you. Wasting your resources thinking that it is shared.

It is perfectly alright to have negative feelings or to reveal your desires. Why do you feel the need to hide them? It may be unhealthy to experience resentment every day, but it is less tiring than to put up a fake image in front of other people.
