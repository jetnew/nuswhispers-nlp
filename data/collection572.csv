57296,"I am in my final year at NUS and will be graduating soon. I remember reading some time back about some confessions of people (esp freshies) coming into uni and being worried about having no one to eat lunch with, don't want to be eating alone, etc. Personally, I've been not just ok with eating alone, but actually prefer to have my own time to myself to enjoy my food, amidst a sometimes busy and tiring timetable. Of course if I get jioed for lunch by friends I would happily accept and it's great to catch up with friends, new and old, over lunch too, but the point is that most of the time I eat by myself.

Which brings me to an article I read recently about the ""inescapable"" office work lunch culture in Singapore on rice media, and it makes me worried. Once I graduate and begin working it appears that there is an unspoken expectation in most places that you should join your co workers for lunch, even if you dont give a flying F about your colleague's wife or his kid is going to school and another 101 things. 

In uni there's no consequences for having lunch alone apart from some people's own self perception that it is awkward and they will get judged. But it seems that at work you avoid work lunches at your own risk of relations and teambuilding and bonding with your colleagues. I don't know, I'll have to wait and see. Why something as simple as lunch got to be so difficult, I dont know"

57282,"Is using dating apps while in a relationship considered cheating???
I found out that my boyfriend (of close to a year) has been using Tinder for the last 2 months — using a fake name, but real profile pic. He claims that he has not met up with anyone and does not intend to do so. He defended himself profusely that he just wanted a platform to chat, where things are casual and non-obligatory? He added that it is also kind of an ego booster when he gets matches, liken to shots of adrenaline? I read through the conversations (very few active chats) and the tone seems neutral and boring in fact. 
I still feel betrayed and hurt by this. While he is deeply apologetic (lost count of the times he has said sorry), I am not sure how to move on or what I should do considering this taint in the relationship. My trust for him has plummeted and I don’t know how it can be regained.

Pls stop and think about what is happening to the seat while you wait in the peak hour queue for your food! Unless you tell me it is OK for others to use your reserved seat while you queue. In that case, the efficiency will be the same. But of course, this defeats your purpose for reserving the seat in the first place.

For groups of friends who want to be assured that they are not split up, they probably have no better alternative than to reserve seats. But pls do not delude yourself into thinking that you are doing others a favor by chope-ing seats. If everyone reserves their seats like you do, you can look forward to waiting beside packs of tissues for a seat to chope. "

57271,"I went to Germany for exchange. If you think Singaporeans are cold and cliquish I can tell you that the Germans are worse. Germans only like to stick with their own kind and do not like to break out of their own circle. Even if you try to strike up conversations with them, they are so stuck in their own shell that the conversations do not go beyond surface level. Singaporeans at least, are more open and willing to engage in conversations once the ice is broken. Furthermore, there seems to be a sense of self-entitlement that some Germans have with regards to their German language. They seem to have this superiority complex when it comes to foreigners and they expect you to learn their language if you go to their country.
Ultimately, the only good thing I got out of my exchange experience was travelling around Europe. Germany felt like a social graveyard with with nothing much to offer. Its culture is saturated with coldness and a general unwillingness to welcome foreigners.  I even dare say that this can be attritubted to the postwar guilt which has shaped their culture. Would I go to Germany for exchange again? The answer is obvious. Tschüss"

57251,"Why I think people (especially CS students) reply to Prof Ben anonymously

As an Associate Professor in NUS School of Computing, Prof Ben is in a position of power. As computing students, it is quite possible that we have to take some modules taught by him at some point of time and are thus subjected to his grading. Even if no un/conscious bias are involved during grading, it would be quite awkward during class if we have criticized him publicly in the past. Furthermore, Prof Ben have many friends/students/admirers who may be our present/future lecturers/friends/bosses and it's at least conceivable that some of them might view us disfavorably un/consciously because of the criticism. Indeed, a quick glance at the profiles of the people who publicly hold different views with Prof Ben using their real ID suggest that most of them have graduated and hence are more likely to be less pressured by Prof Ben's influence.

As a comparison, consider voting during an election. It wouldn't be fair to make all individual votes public, right? So why should it be different for online conversation?

3. Grow some balls, everybody can be offended at something or somebody. If you think you have been wronged just state why or ignore. I think that's more classy and constructive than using language like ""you are smoking something"". There are many who already agree with you. Try to always preach to the unconverted. Rhetoric doesnt work well, it might even backfire.

Guten Tag.
I've been on exchange in Germany before (Uni Heidelberg). I've got my culture shock too when I was there. I was seating at an empty seat where there were some books on the other side of a medium sized table, nobody was there then, in the university library. But when that student came back, she, a caucasian, said in German that she reserved the whole table, and shooed me away. 

Despite this incident, I don't put labels to the local culture and judge them using my own cultural values. If you intend to go to other parts of the world to open your eyes, then you have to be prepared for things that are not what you are not in alignment with your values. As an exchange student, I don't know why you are judging us by calling us ""really selfish"". This is not the open-mindedness Germans claim to embrace (die Aufgeschlossenheit). Entitled much? But then that's the attitude of the majority of young Germans I came across during my year there. "

Your comment might seem light-hearted and even funny to some, but to others who are frantically looking grab help of any kind, it could seem really discouraging.

I dont think that being slower is an advantage. To quote myself: ""I think for a start, you should feel happy that you are slower!"". One could be happy because of an advantage, but I meant it differently. 

For example, I was upset when I did CS2102 because it was simple to me as most of the challenging concepts are similar to CS1231. On the other hand, a person struggling with CS2102 could or even should be happy because it is an opportunity to properly learn the concepts in CS1231 that he/she might have missed out on. Doing well in CS2102 would be a positive feedback that they have learnt those material well. Instead of feeling discouraged when material gets hard, I think that being positive about the learning opportunities behind them will be helpful."

57228,"#57198 yes... I'm surprised that some people actually think the culture of reserving seats is reasonable. They are sadly unaware of how selfish they are. yes, reserving seats save them from the trouble to find seats all around after getting food, but do they realize that the seats they reserve could have been used by other people who are just as anxiously looking for a seat? Public resources can be and should be better used, especially when they are limited.

57226,"Hi all... Coming from a 过来人, I just wanna say, please leave your partner if he/she cheats on you. Don’t ever give him/her a second chance, ever!! 

My gf cheated on me when we were one year together. I wanna share with all of you about my experience, the type of tactics cheaters use with the ultimately goal of teaching you all so that hopefully there will be less heartbreaks in the world. 

Tactic 1: when I’m suspecting my gf cheating on me and I confront her, she will deny and shift the blame by accusing me back for not trusting her. When I had concrete evidence (photos, text messages), she was disappointed and accused me for invading her privacy (cos I checked her phone to get the evidence). Basically, she will divert her wrongdoing and accuse something else back in an attempt to fight back the argument. 

Trait 2: she will use phrases such as “turn over a new leaf”, “forgive and forget”, “don’t hold grudge”, “what’s done is done” and “look forward in life” to dismiss her cheating. She also claimed “love is unconditional and I should accept her for who she is”. If I can’t forgive her over a moment of folly, how are we gonna face all the obstacles in future? Love means to accept everything unconditionally. 

Trait 3: I forgive her but she cheated on me again 2 months later. When I found out, she claimed I’m not open minded enough and said “cmon, it’s the 21st century, not back in the 80s”. If I don’t accept her for who she is, i don’t deserve her. Alternatively, she will play victim by blaming alcohol.

It’s really hell for me and I finally managed to break free from her. It might be scary to be alone, especially since you have invested so much into the relationship. But to people in similar situation, please just break away, trust me... it’s the best thing you can do. 

Please don’t be naive and believe in phrases like “turn over a new leaf” or “forgive and forget”. Instead, remember “a leopard can never change its spot”. Casual sex (be it player, cheater, fwb or one night stand) goes to show a lot about a person’s character and self control. There’s no benefit dating people with such history. It will only put you at risk. I’m not saying it’s true 100% of the time that people with such history are unfaithful. But the probability is higher. Since nothing is 100% in this world.  The best you should do is to be wise and minimize this probability unless you really have no other better suitor. "
57225,"Into my 3rd year here and I'm starting to see more people becoming insurance agents. What annoyed my friends and I is that these people only become closer and friendly towards you after joining one of those insurance companies. It's kinda irritating when these people spam insurance policies and perks of getting consultations with them on their social media platforms. Those annoying calls asking if they could meet you up for meals are just so wrong, especially the ones whom I have never spoken to. 
And this may not be true, but I noticed some patterns - most of them that I know of, were from dance CCAs and had bad grades during school. "
57224,"Re: scootering in an earlier post, a lot is about how the scooters are used. 

Yes, the paths are narrow but not that narrow. So theoretically, pedestrians and scooters can peacefully co-exist. Presuming we split the pavement into two 'lanes', the pedestrians can keep to one 'lane' and scooters keep to the other 'lane' right?

But in real life, that's not what happens. Multiple times I have seen scooters being ridden side-by-side, so you see two or three scooters blocking up the whole lane. Or a pedestrian is in one lane, and the scooter is in the exact same lane, going fast and not changing lane. I guess they just expect the pedestrian to avoid them? 

No one wants a head-on collision, so if you're riding a scooter, please switch lanes earlier. And please do not block the whole lane by riding side-by-side with your friends. That is what truly pushes pedestrians onto walking on the bike lane.

Someone brought up 'scooter-bashing', but seriously, if scooterists(?) practice some courtesy and pedestrians do too, then both parties wouldn't be so unhappy. And yeah don't be that guy who swears at someone irl just for being a pedestrian. "
57223,"Had breakfast today with my boyfriend, and saw an old teammate of mine. Okay, not really teammate, but we used to play floorball together and we're kinda friends.

Seeing him today made me feel strange for some reason. We didn't have much of a relationship, maybe a couple of hookups when in JC after he broke up with his then-gf, but nothing more than that and that was it. We didn't see the need to continue seeing each other, and we had one of those friendships that died out.

We're both in NUS, and though we no longer play floorball together, I still do see him around with his friends and girlfriend, since our faculties are pretty close together.

I guess it's just a sense of longing I guess, but since this morning I've started unconsciously comparing this relationship to the other one. He might not be well-off like my current boyfriend, but he does make an effort, my current one just seems to think that buying me expensive gifts will keep me happy.

57221,"Just wondering, are CIP hours useful for University students? If so, is there a platform where we can keep track of how many CIP hours we've gained? Or do we add it in our resumes or something?"
57220,"There are so many people using the Grab scooters right now. They go quite fast and, combined with their numbers and with the narrow pavements, I'm often forced to walk in the bike lane next the moving vehicles.

Also, there was one guy who apparently couldn't use a scooter and move it in a straight path, so he kept zig-zagging down the pavement. Then he had the nerve to yell ""chao chibai!"" at me for existing on the same pavement and thus, I suppose, making his weak attempts at scootering harder. You'd think college students would be more mature than that, but I find myself constantly questioning that stance.

That rude guy aside, this scooter problem is even worse on campus than outside of it. I understand that it gets people around campus faster, but why wasn't a thought ever spared for pedestrians when this was considered for approval? I find it ironic for pedestrians to be sometimes pushed onto the bike lanes, while the scooters never use the bike lane.  "
57219,"To #57198 (the German exchange student), I can empathise with the culture shock you felt. And this is coming from someone who comes from a country which already shares many overlaps in culture with Singapore to begin with.

I know that you may not have that sort of luxury of time, so my advice is that you probably could take some time to internalise and reflect on the cultural differences and rationalise them.

Talking about holocaust when topic is about people putting bags on tables when they're away? Hello? Way to make NUS people and Singaporeans in general look like a bunch of uneducated and uncaring morons."
57200,"So I want to drop a module to ""underload"" this semester. (Because I'm only left with 3 modules to fulfil)

Cors didn't allow me to do it, but got me to email the faculty for help. I did it and am still waiting for their reply. 

So now, should I still attend the class that I'm dropping? It's a seminar so it's very obvious if I'm in class or not. I'm just afraid that if I don't attend and if my appeal fails, then I would lose out on attendance marks. But if I attend, and leave suddenly, it would be unfair for my groupmates.

What should I do?"
