57497,I’m here for some opinions and here’s some context. I’m 23(F) and my bf 22(M) are together for about 4+ months. We get along well and we’re decently active sexually ( 2-3 times a week). Last week when my bf lent me his HDD to copy some shows I chanced upon his porn collection 80+gb(100 over videos). I have no issues with porn as I watch porn too but am I wrong to feel that having a collection of 100+ videos a little excessive? Anyone out there have a different opinion? 
57496,"Does anyone face this problem? During a semester, I would be able to thoroughly understand a mod and score A for it. I could explain the concepts well from my head and require minimal references.

However once the semester ends, and a new sem starts, I just find it difficult to recall the concepts that I once understood well. I cant recall them from the back of my head anymore, and may need to learn the concepts again (much faster now compared to the first time I learnt it).

This just means that I could not retain those knowledge learnt, and I am really wondering if there is any point in learning them so hard since I will forget them later anyway. "

I relate to you too... the confuse between lust, love, or friends...

I have known this boy for 4 years and have been pretty good friend. he just broke up with his gf of 2 years and we suddenly hang out more... one day he hold my hand, I didn't reject him, we continue to progress futher to kiss, cuddle, even orals...

I've never been in rs. I find comfort in his presence... but I am fine without his presence too.

I believe I am just a rebound from his ex but I still want to give comfort to him as a friend, not love. 

I felt so bad at one period of time, thinking both of us are just making use of each others' body in the name of friendship and loneliness.

After some drama and honest conversation, we r now in sort of fwb relationship. We r both actively finding bf/gf yet are comfortable with each others' company before we meet the right one...

Maybe, OP, just talk to ur ex-gf and see if both of you can work it out together?"

57490,"I came from a difficult family where my own family always thought that I played shenanigans, so they would help to sabotage my work as often as they could. I would try to stay out as long as possible, and then in the end felt so lost. I know I am in a lot of troubles now, it's scary but I guess they call it life."
57486,"Barely a week into the term, CS2040 and CS2040C have created quite a stir amongst students. 

Dijkstra reports.

Aikenot Dueet, a distraught 2040 student whom we found crying in a cubicle, told us how sorting has effectively screwed his life. ""At first, they sorted us by marks and assigned us letters based on a curve, and now, they are teaching us sorting while sorting us at the same time,"" weeped Aikenot.

We understand that students of this much dreaded course learn interestingly named sorting algorithms in the first few weeks, such as bubblesort, mergesort and quicksort. 

Despite being the humble algorithm it is, bubblesort embodies many of society's values. When a number is greater than the number on its immediate right, swapping happens. In layman terms, when one goes up, another has to go down. We'll discuss the socio-political significance of other algorithms in future reports.

Another student, Aino Laif, had a much more positive impression of 2040. He said, ""When finals ended, I felt as if my life no longer had any purpose. I was depressed by the lack of work and torture and even contemplated suicide. But thankfully, my depressing workless holiday was cut short by two weeks when my professor sent us an email asking us to do C++ problems or get sorted. That was the best new year of my life.""

Students of the school of Java have it much worse than their C++ counterparts as they are constantly reminded of the fact that their lives are public, static and void. Disciples of Source and survivors of 1101S were mortified to find mutation in almost every line of code they wrote. The uninformed had a nasty shock when they realised Java and JavaScript were two very different things.

A resigned student, Aikenever Dueet, told us, ""I joined CS with the hope of changing the world. Now, I guess I'll just be flipping pancakes for the rest of my living days.""

The aforementioned student wasn't enthused when we pointed out a sorting algorithm named after his potential career.

Meanwhile, our investigative journalists are busy finding connections, if any, between the 2040 instructors, the head of the state and the fountain of wealth. We hope to get back to you soon."

57484,"I was at the Student Life Award ceremony yesterday and was utterly shocked by the amount of food left after the event. The amount of money spent on wasted food could have easily been used to fund another community-engagement initiative or an overseas field trip under research projects – notwithstanding the carbon footprint of producing that large amount of food. 
To me, this shows the epic failure of our education whereby the a respected institution condones and even endorses such wastage of resources. I can’t help but to parodise NUS’ motto “to educate, inspire and transform”: if the university continues to do this, we’re going to be transformed into nothing but selfish, wasteful individuals who don’t give a damn to the sufferings of the poor or to the environmental crisis looming ahead.

57482,"I have a girlfriend who likes to drink and party. I trust her and she says there is nothing to worry about. But I still feel uncomfortable about it. She gets pretty upset when I ask her not to go club, saying that I am depriving her of social life. I don't like clubbing and I don't know her friends well so I don't join her. Am I wrong to tell her I don't want her to go? Is it possible that girls can go club and not dance with guys? (The group of friends she goes with also have guys)"

57467,"I am currently a female resident in the residential college nearest to Singapore Polytechnic. Recently I was walking towards the laundry room on the mixed floor and saw a girl coming out of the bathroom with only a towel wrapped around her. Just wondering if its appropriate to do so especially since its a mixed floor where guys are just around the corner. Similarly for guys who stay on mixed floor, I've seen a few coming out half naked from the bathroom. Its sometimes disturbing to see such scenes and thus I would hope that my fellow residents can fully dress up after your showers before exiting the bathroom."

I do not care what I do, I just want to earn lots of money so that my parents can retire in a few years time. (of course I do know that money doesn't fall from the sky/ we gotta work hard to earn money and there is no shortcut in life, neither am I expecting myself to be a rich and successful person overnight without putting in any hard work).

57456,So... hanging out with you was fun and tbh I do like you as a person but the reason why I'm not romantically interested in you is that you don't give me the sense of security that I need so badly in a relationship. I don't feel like I'm someone special to you so I don't dare to give my heart away. I'm sorry to push you away like this. I really am. 
57455,"Regarding the discussion over NS, I want to highlight about the necessity of NS in Singapore’s context. Many commenters claimed NS is a form of deterrence, but is it really so? 

1. Our population is so small compared to other countries, even if we jack up the quantity using NS, do you think military quality is there? 

2. Our country is so small. Given the 21st century technological driven modern warfare, the mentality that modern military still invade via soldiers holding rifle and dagger is absurd. In a technological era, a war typically goes like this: missile and rocket attack followed by carpet bombing via plane. Then marine warship and submarine to seize control of navy space followed by isolation of Singapore from supply. 70% of attacks would be done without a single army soldier invader need to set foot on Singapore. 

Instead of having compulsory NS, a better deterrence is to use soft power. Forge international allies and make Singapore indispensable to them so that they will protect us. Look at Switzerland, they have such importance in banking such that even Nazi didn’t invade them during WW2.

Given the geographical and population constraint of a small country like us, the huge military budget and NS are very inefficient allocation of resources and waste of male Singaporean’s time. A better way to channel the money and time should be:

1. Learn from Switzerland. Carve out an international niche so that we are indispensable on the international stage. I believe as a small nation, we need to use our brain instead of sheer force (because we would never have enough brute force).

2. Invest in education. Send more male scholars overseas to forge ties with other powerful countries instead of wasting their 2 years in NS. 

3. If you really want defense, pump in more money into military R&D in DSTA to create revolutionary technology instead of making more combat ration and army credit to feed unwilling-to-serve NSF. 

This is the 21st modern war fate. Please don’t be naive and think you need sheer soldier numbers to serve as deterrence, this is not Ancient Rome where gladiator thrives. Even North Korea knows this and is trying so hard to invent long range ballistic missile and nuclear warhead to deter its US enemy. "
