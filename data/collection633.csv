63399,Should I try and exempt from CS1101S through the Computing Placement Tests for A-level holders? Is it worth it to try and jump ahead now?
63398,"1) I don't think it is nice to advice 50-50 split. What is the purpose of dating if everything need to split so nicely? That is what i did to my friends, then what is different between friends and a date? Must well continue within the friendship boundary, lesser problem, more freedom. 

2) I see some brought up the point that gender equality means girls must serve NS. The nature of military/NS is so physically demanding. Man has a natural advantage over this because of higher testosterone level that is partly responsible for the muscle development, that woman can never catch up with. I don't see gender equality in this to start with until that day that woman is created with the same testosterone level as men.

3) Some argue that woman should stop thinking that giving birth is doing a favor for men. Fine lorh, true that no one force woman to give birth, so no children after marriage. Electricity bills, water bills, dining bills, petrol fees, house installments ... ALL split EVENLY... Is this the marriage you really want? I think is better to find 情人 if like this, this type of marriage can't even sustain for a year, 迟早离婚干脆不要结婚."
63397,"Dear all, seeking genuine advice here as I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm an engineering student who is due to graduate this year and my job search for the past 7 months has been extremely tough as I have gone for interview after interview with no offer. A couple of days ago, I finally got my only offer from a Japanese MNC for a role as an engineer in Japan. The job pays slightly higher than a comparable position in Singapore and the company provides subsidized housing but all other expenses like food and transport are not included. Most importantly, it comes with a 3 year bond. I am really hesitant to go for 2 main reasons. First, 3 years is a really long time to spend away from my family and girlfriend. This is especially as my parents are getting old (near 70) and my mum has recently been diagnosed with a chronic illness. I'd want to spend more time by their side. As a new employee, I doubt I'd be able to take leave and fly back as frequently as I wish due to the commitment on the job. Second, I don't know how well I can adapt alone in a foreign place so far away. I don't know of any seniors working there. Although they told me the working environment speaks mostly english, I have zero knowledge of japanese and the culture and this may hinder me in everyday living. Previously during my exchange in another country, I have been bullied or cheated several times by the locals because I don't know their language and it has left bad memories on me. I have also heard about the slave driving culture in japan and widespread overworking and this worries me as well. 

On the other hand if I reject this offer, I will face the long and uncertain job search ahead with no guarantee if I am ever able to get a proper job. Honestly, my CAP is not fantastic and I don't have much other achievements like internships or CCAs to show on my resume. Pls help...I would love to hear all advice you guys can give. I have 2 weeks to give them a reply."
63396,"For all those who keep insisting that how much their BFs spend on them = how much the BFs love them...

You are basically saying that without them paying, they won't get your love/ attention.

I have news for you. Instead of being in a relationship, you are employed in the world's oldest profession.

63395,"In response to #63395: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/63395
Pretty much in the same position as you as I'm studying overseas. Honestly never thought about relationships even though I knew I would have a family of my own someday (somehow). I literally didn't bother socialising much because some people were pretty superficial (academics, gym, investments etc were my top priorities). 
It was only when my housemates asked me about dating and marriage in general, which made me realise that I needed “experience” – dating experience, to discover what kind of person I’m looking for, how people behaved during dates, dos and don’ts, how to sustain a conversation etc. Trust me, I’m pretty introverted by nature as well, which didn’t help since I was very skinny as well last time, so I mainly focused on a variety of self-improvement (study hard, do stuff you enjoy, read more books). Now, some of my friends are even surprised that I’m still single despite taking care of my physique and having pretty ok grades.
Similar to you, I’m looking for someone from Singapore - similar values/upbringing etc., and so I started using tinder/CMB (CMB better imo) to meet new people whenever I'm back in SG. I've had good and bad dates/meetups, and I feel that only after having your fair share of good and bad dates will you realise what kind of person you’re looking for. Obviously all chats start off with topics such as hobbies, then you can ask about what they do for leisure, overseas exchange programmes (cooking and living alone etc, places they’ve visited – share pictures and stuff), how they view relationships (perhaps ask why they’re not attached etc.), why did they choose that degree/job position, what gets them up in the morning, their goals and dreams etc. If they’re someone who has pretty similar goals, go and ask them out to find out more about them.
As for group hangouts, you can always sit beside someone you’re interested in, get to know them through small talk etc. (can’t say much about that since I mainly use dating apps) – maybe can ask Jonathan Choi (11/10 solid advice).
My advice for you is to either sign up for NUS events, or just do it the simpler way - dating apps. I ALWAYS got awkward around females, especially when my housemates invited them over for drinks and stuff, but it is through these “failures” that you know how to spark conversations with random people. The more you are put in situations like these, the less awkward you will feel – similar to public speaking (I had mad jitters whenever I had to do those last time, now it’s pretty chill for me). 
I wish you all the best, and don’t dig into the mentality of “oh, I’m awkward as shit etc.”, just go out and try. Many a time we overthink and end up doing nothing. If it helps, just think of it as going out and making friends first – with males and females. Who knows, they might even introduce you to a potential someone."
63394,"#randomethought (Notes from an exchange student from Europe before leaving) Sometimes I don't even understand why someone complaining about the Computer Science undergrad at NUS. You have no idea how lucky you are. Regardless of world rankings, NUS CS offers a very wide range of modules with different grading methods, lots of projects, active professors, a path to different Start-up bubbles, a summer Open source ware supports for freshmen, numerous undergraduate research opportunities, active NUS Hackers and NUS computing clubs, numerous companies in and out of the Career Services, countless information session events and exclusive competitions/hackathons, supporting TAs, double degree with CMU, extensive range or top partner universities, diversity, etc. These opportunities and exposures are comparable to Stanford or Berkeley tbh and even surpass many top universities in the World at a reasonable cost - a public cost (+1 for the extensive financial aid program at NUS). Some of you guys whose usual rants are about exams or grades please stop and enjoy your university life. Virtually any big companies in any fields operate in Singapore. Your university is very desirable and competitive in the world. I'm really jealous of your university and the opportunities here."

63391,"Just my 2cents on the who pay-the-bills-things. As a pretty conservative guy, i feel rightfully that guys should be the one treating. Call me old fashion, but i think that as the breadwinner and the supposed 'head of the family', its right to use whatever you've earned or have to treat your significant other. In fact, i think that if i were to truly love someone, having the privilege of doing something nice like taking my partner out for dinner would be one of the most blissful things that i can do. That being said, what irks me off about girls is that some of them choose to take advantage of that. I'm okay with treating, but not with being taken advantage of and taken for granted. Most smart guys could actually tell from the response and the gratitude of girls towards being treated as a major consideration for future marriage suitability. After all, you could tell a lot about someone based on the small things that they do. And you wouldn't want to spend the rest your life with the wrong person. So guys, stick to shivery, but also use your head. And for girls, make them feel that their effort is appreciated."
63390,"Hi Damien Teong, I saw your reply to #63330 and I was wondering if you can shed some light on your interpretation on my situation + MBTI. I've been doing the MBTI test once every two years for more than 10 years and I've been classified as INFJ. If anything, my introversion has been increasing over the years; the latest test shows 95%. I'm So I guess I'm really an INFJ?

Since young I've always been a people pleaser and I take comments about me very negatively, because I feel that I've failed to meet people's expectation, can't make anybody happy, etc. Additionally, I've always wanted to have friends (not acquaintance, I have plenty of those) but I can't seem to have any, no matter how hard I try; I always ended up being thrown away after use. I've read on various sites that INFJs have problems finding friends because we are too rare and people can't relate to us. However, the description of MBTI also seem to say that INFJs are very inspirational and make really good friends.

So is my inability to have any friends despite really wanting to have one (and I've always made the effort just that I've been failing) related to me being an INFJ? How can I do to improve my situation? Is there anything I can do to force myself to think and become another MBTI personality type, like ISFJ and ESFJ, so that I can be more like others and become more compatible with other human beings and eventually have a friend....?

Thank you in advance, and anybody else who can give some useful advice."
63389,"Wasnt really bothered about my own height ( 172 cm) until I started working in the Central Business District areas.

63388,"So here is my situation, I had a really heavy lunch before I went for my job interview at a start-up company and the interviewer basically showed me around their office and their 'awesome' pantry laid with snacks and drinks. She offered me to take one beer and snack, which I declined as I brought my own water. After the interview, she asked again if I wish to take from their 'awesome' pantry again, which I again politely declined, she looks a bit disappointed though, so just curious is it considered rude to decline a drink/snack during an interview?"
63387,"Need some advice: How many times do you meet your S.O in a week, assuming you are both busy & working?"
63386,"I'm currently doing my internship and I met so many wonderful friends and people in the company within a short period of time. However, whenever we are having lunch together, I have always suffered from being able to strike a conversation with the people around me. I struggled with trying to think of topics and I could literally not even interact with people because of it. One side of me really wants to have a meaningful conversation with them because I don't want to be seen as being anti-social. However, I'm always having difficulty to open up myself whenever I just meet new people. I only start to open myself when I know the person for a long period of time as I felt comfortable when I’m with them. It really feels exhausting for me and sometimes being alone is the only choice which makes me feel more comfortable.

The feeling of this is really depressing and many times I wish I wasn't like this. I really don't want to give a bad impression to other people. Just wondering if there is anyone who has this feeling before?"
63384,"As much as they NUS is a really good university etc, as a student here, i don't even feel like it is a place to enjoy learning. And the departments/faculties are not making it any better. Their only focus is on our CAP. If you want to apply for an academic programme/specialisation you are really passionate about, they look at CAP.  I don't think they realise that they should start looking beyond CAP. As an university student currently, i worry if employers will not look beyond CAP. Any suggestions for this?"

63370,"NUS used to be famous for being the first in Singapore and the top in Asia. Individuals with almost perfect GPAs in poly and good A level results strived to be in NUS, a school that they could be proud to be part of. 

I was quite saddened by all the recent saga. I came from a not very well to do family and is not very smart. Had to retake A levels just to get into NUS . The amount of mental breakdowns I have received just to enter NUS has significantly affected my outlook on life greatly. 

Looking back at how much I had sacrificed in the past just to enter a school that is tainted by all the scands really hurts me a lot. It seems like all my hardwork has been cancelled off like what have I been doing with my life? I could have pursued my passion. 

I thought people who lives in Hall had more school pride? What happen to all the pride from entering NUS? Those non NUS people...stop being sour just because you you cannot enter a prestigious school! Don't say that you didn't want to enter. If you didn't want to enter in the first place, why would you be reading NUSWhispers?"

However, I see my friends' bfs paying for them most of the time, showering them with gifts etc and I just can't help but think about my rship sometimes.

63360,"Hi everyone I’m the OP of #63298 and I really appreciate all the educated debates. I’m back with a new topic. 

I finished serving my national service a few years ago and the lack of manpower back then was already terrible. With falling birthrates, manpower for NS will decrease and there won’t be enough people to protect Singapore. So why not let the women serve NS as well? 

Back in the days, men were chosen to serve the army because wars required the physically strong to fight the wars. However as times are changing, wars are increasing fought with a touch of a button to launch cyber attacks or missiles. Wars now are no longer about fighting on the grounds. 

So why shouldn’t women serve the army as well? Countries like Norway, Israel and Sweden have mandatory national service for both genders. Are we trying to imply that independent Singaporean women are not capable of doing some admin work, devise strategies, and protect the country? There are PES E guys with major health conditions who are far weaker physically than the average women but still need to serve the army. So why shouldn’t we send women to the army as well? NS can help them grow as a person and teach them life skills too. 

Women now have more and more rights. But with more rights come more responsibilities. It’s 2019 and all about equality now too. It’s unfair if a women chooses to serve the army and gets paid $2k+ per month while guys have no choice but to serve and get paid $560 per month. In order to better protect Singapore, we need all the help we can get."
63359,"My boyfriend has an unconventional career where he makes gains which don’t need to be taxed & relies on a lot of prize money. So like from moving money around alone, he can make $10k in 2 weeks or $300/day. I haven’t started working yet but there’s no entry point career in sg that let’s me match his income. At first when we went out, I’d try to offer to pay every 3rd/4th date but then it got to a point where his spending is rly so uncontrolled, I cudn’t keep up, so he pays for us both mostly. He also has atas taste. Every regular meal at least costs $80+. Even eating at home he spends $40 on one meal. That’s like what I spend in 1-2 weeks. So after a while I stopped offering to pay bc I rly can’t but I feel bad that he pays for my everything after a while. Idk how guys think in these situations. He’s German & I hear dating culture there is 50-50? Is this a power move? Does he feel sorry for me? Or is he actually happy & willing to pick up the tab? Idk. I rly appreciate him so I don’t want him to feel like I’m financially abusing him of some sort. Also this is my first stable r/s so I don’t rly know what the cultural convention is.

I can buy $10 stuff myself, not an issue. but pamper abit cannot meh"
63354,"Just my 2 cents on the current who should pay thingy

I graduated about 2 years ago and my partner earns about 1/2 of my salary (he isn't a uni grad) but just a disclaimer that although I earn more, my monthly expenses is also higher as I take care of my mine+my parents' phone bills, the house internet and tv bills plus my mom's monthly doctor fees plus tuition fee loans. 

Whenever we go out, he's always the one taking out his card to pay the bills. I personally feel that it sometimes can get awkward because when a waiter/waitress brings the bill to the table, they tend to face towards the guy and guys usually will insist on paying so they won't malu in that sense. So what I do is I usually round up/down the bill amount and while walking out I'll do a quick paynow transfer. Not to the nearest cent la but roughly divide by 2. 

If it's other things like movies. He gets the tickets, I get the drinks. We don't calculate so clearly like the tickets cost $20 and the food $17 so I now owe him $1.50. We let go of the small amounts. Maybe next time I'll get him koi during his lunch break. 

If it's bigger things like travelling, one of us usually pays the full amount. And the other just transfers his/her share. Of course before doing this, we look through ticket prices/hotel prices together to discuss our individual budgets and find something both of us can agree on. 

If you're a girl, and you want to get a mani/pedi, more makeup, new shoes or whatever, pay for it yourself. It is your own materialistic wants. A guy has zero obligations to be paying for your shopping and entertainment. I have some friends that hint to their boyfriends about the new designer bag that they want etc and then get upset because he doesn't get it. A regular guy's pockets isn't infinite ?!!?!?

TLDR: Women are strange creatures, we always want equal rights but also to be treated like a princess. Life isn't a fairy tale la, be realistic and treat your partner fairly (i.e. treat him/her in the same way that you would want to be treated)."

I just wanted to say that if we become so calculative, every thing must be halved equally, then what’s the point of being in a romantic relationship? Just be single then? Or when Husband or Wife meets a financial crisis, just go for a divorce? Since fair ma, everything half-half, so why the need to stay on for each other for the financial crisis? Divorce right, should you also cut the child half???

Let’s think."
63326,"Hi #63298, I'm a Singaporean girl and I agree with you that Singaporean girls might possibly be the worst of all.

I admit that I used to be materialistic, demanding, self-absorbed, spoilt and entitled. I see some of these traits in my female friends and siblings too. 

I expected my ex-boyfriends to treat me like a princess, offer to pay for dates and buy me gifts on special occasions. I've never taken my suitors seriously because I always thought I deserved better. 

Alot of my suitors and exes eventually found themselves a foreign girlfriend. I can tell that they are happier now with their foreign girlfriends. Some are even married now. I'm happy for them, seriously.

I'm really glad things turned out this way. Not that it's their fault, but most of the guys I dated couldn't really fulfill my expectations. I think I was way too fussy and high maintenance for them. 

I always wanted a smart, ambitious, alpha yet kind, chivalrous, down-to-earth guy with a good sense of humour. Most of the guys I've met were lacking in these areas. 

I refused to settle for mediocrities and surprisingly I met the man of my dreams when I actually gave up on dating. We've been together for four years and married for two. 

I'm more than willing to be his submissive beta because he's such a sexy alpha male with a big heart. I guess I'm really lucky to have found someone I really liked.

Nonetheless, I wouldn't advise girls to have such crazy high standards because many of my friends who dumped their boyfriends for more eligible guys eventually ended up getting dumped themselves. They're still single but not by choice. So it's always safer to manage your expectations and settle for someone of your league rather than someone out of your league. And to guys who prefer foreigners, I'd say good for you and all the best :)"
63324,"I have been in a relationship for more than one year now, and i have always been paying for my meals after the first few dates onwards and treating my bf on special occasions as well as getting expensive gifts (around $800 in this year alone)

When it comes to who should pay, i feel that if guys offer to pay the first few meals while in the dating stage, it does help in showing that you are willing to pay for them and invest in the relationship. I didnt expect my bf to pay the first few times but i did appreciate the gesture. Then once the relationship is in the more comfortable stage, maybe a few months in, you can explain to your gf that while you do want to keep paying for her, you feel that treating her on special occasions and getting gifts, will make it more special than treating her every meal. This also helps you to save money so you can save up for these special occasions. 

If the girl isn’t a gold digger, she will completely understand if you guys just talk it out, i have a few guy friends who always complain to me about having to pay for their gfs, but when i ask if they tried asking the girlfriend, they said no, and assume that she wont be happy. But after i suggested them to talk it out with their gfs, it all worked out and the gfs do treat them occasionally now too, so point is dont be passive aggressive about it as it might not be clear to her that you are unhappy about having to pay. Most girls are decent enough to understand especially if they like you enough. If they don’t then it’s time to dump her."

63318,"Recent posts talk a lot about the price of love but doesn't seem to understand what exactly is love.

Love isn't in the slaps a mother resort to wake a child up for breakfast. 
It is the warm food that will turn cold soon if the child isn't awake.

Love didn't disappear with a set of BTO keys to be forfeited from the lack of commitment to each other.
It disappeared in the hours waiting for the spouse to meet for dinner, knowing he/she won't turn up again.

Love isn't in the desperation of two lovers that cannot let go of each other apart at the airport.
It is in the warm hug of reunion to end a long-distance relationship by sacrificing one world and one way of life for another.

Love is long gone in the eyes of a fighting couple waiting for a slip to gain an upper hand.
It remains in the hands that connects the phone to the charger for the spouse who forgot and fell asleep.

Love died in expectations that it is supposed to mean something.
It only returns when every act is a mindless caress of care that satiates the giver. 

Love is to add value to each other, regardless of price. 
Everything else, comes with a price, but with no relation to value.

So stop asking for the price of love. It is no longer love the moment a price is given."

63308,"I would go dutch if I am going out with a girl. There is when she is not really my girlfriend and is in the initial stage of going out. But moving onto later stages, I will definitely pay for the dates. Even if we really break up, I think is worth spending those money because you have to be gentleman and mature about it."

63302,"Hi, I am the OP of the two cents post and I feel the need to clarify a few things here.

Well, I think the biggest issue is whether a guy should be expected to pay for all or most of the dates. First of all, I do not think that a guy should be the one paying for everything and with that being said, I mean I have never expected my bf to pay for everything for me. When we just got together, we always go Dutch (including our first date), but as time goes by, he starts to pay more and more frequently and till now 4 years into our rs, he will reject me if I offer to pay for my share let alone pay for the both of us. 

This definitely shows his sincerity and seriousness towards me and the rs as he loves me more than he loves his money (thanks to all the comments in my previous post cause now I know many of you actually love your money more than you love your SO). Thus, me too will  give him all the support, care and guidance that he needs because I know he is a man to keep. It works both ways. I buy things for him too but the ratio is still 90/10 because he rarely needs anything and he enjoy getting me stuffs.

To those butthurt people on my previous post, I think you just can't stand it when I point out the fact that if you're unwilling to pay for your SO it means that you love your money more than you love your SO. I feel sad for your partner as you will leave them for monetary issue and if this is not selfish idk what is."
63301,"Referring to one of the previous posts on friend zone recently, I also think that there’s not much problem with it. A guy and girl can be friends because if either one has no feelings for the other, there’s no way a r/s can really develop soon"
63300,"I don't understand why some people argue over who should pay for dates? I've heard things like ""guys should offer to pay"", ""should just go dutch all the time"", etc. But is this really so important?

First of all, let's be realistic. Dating usually requires time and money. 

But, if you really love someone, you wouldn't want him/her to waste money because you'll worry if they have enough savings for themselves. 

So, realistically, the question should not be ""who should pay?"" but rather, ""who is more able to pay?"". 

Of course, this has nothing to do with gender. I'm a woman and I used to pay for all of my dates with my bf because he was a student back then while I already graduated.

Although my family isn't well-off, my parents and relatives often persuaded me to break up with him because they think he's just a poor student and that I deserved better. 

I know they love me and want me to find a 'better' guy who would take better care of me. But I never really thought about all these issues. All I could think about was whether my bf has enough money to spend on food and transport, etc. 

Back then, he was a student with very little allowance and some earnings from internships and part-time jobs. 

Whenever we go on a date, he would always offer to pay for everything and I would secretly transfer him the full amount because I know he wouldn't want me to waste money either. And sometimes, I would just put some cash in his wallet when he's not looking. 

When he needed a laptop for school, I offered to pay half for it and asked him to take it as a loan from me although I had no intention to ask him to return the money.

When we went on short overseas trips, I persuaded him to let me pay for them, with the excuse that he could always pay for future holiday trips after he graduate.

When his super old and lousy phone spoilt, I surprised him with a new one, pretending it was an early birthday gift. He wanted to pay me back for the phone but I persuaded him to pay me when he starts working.

Everyone thought I'm the stupid one in the relationship but they had no idea how happy I feel when I see him getting so touched by all these little things I've done for him.

Now that he's been working for close to a year, he would still offer to pay for everything all the time. And I would still secretly transfer him some money every now and then.

He also bought me a new phone last Christmas and surprised me with an engagement ring on Valentine's day. That ring was the exact one that I casually mentioned about many years ago. Throughout all these years, I've never thought about getting anything in return. But that really was the best gift I've ever received - a lifetime of commitment.

Whether you're a girl or guy, if you really like someone, please just offer to pay for your dates. It's a really nice way of showing that you're willing to invest in the relationship. 

Yes, in relationships, you might possibly not get anything in return despite all the effort and hardwork and you might even get your heart broken if things don't work out. But if you have never put your heart into it, you most likely would never get the happy ending you dreamed of."
