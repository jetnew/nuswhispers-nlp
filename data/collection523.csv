Some advice from a 24 yo attached male. good that you do some homework before asking your crush out. and no, it's not crazy to do a recee before hand. make sure you know how to go to the place and know the menu well, doesn't look good if you look lost getting there or dk what to order right??

Regarding running out of topics, just try to keep the conversation open ended, it can be sch related stuffs but i think it will be good if you can ask some personal qns (but not too personal duhh), maybe ask her what she like to do during her free time and stuffs. And also plan your timing well, dont overstay in the cafe, ltr nothing to talk about then will awkward silence.

Since both of you are living opposite ends of mrt line, i think it's alright to just farewell when both of yall reached the station. Unless both of you still have many things to talk about and the feeling is reciprocated then it's alright to send to her station. 

and do not put her on a pedestal, treat her the same level as you. I know you're nervous (just like every other guys' first date but be sure to keep yourself compose. best of luck bro.

i am so pissed off at her but i didn't say anything back because i think it's pointless to argue with people like her. i think everyone has the right to ride the lift no matter healthy or not as this is a public service. but even follow her logic of ""making room in lift for people who in real needs"", she should not randomly accuse others as she could not have known everyone's condition, for example, there might be people with bad knees or urgent appointments.

Tell me about it. I knew this one girl in a GEM when I was in y2.

She wasn't ready and wanted to be friends. I was heartbroken and stuff.

Took me over a year to get over her. It was painful at that time. I was flooding my ears with ""Another Song about the Weekend"" and ""Have Faith in me"" at every possible waking moment.

I started comparing myself with her, how she was always positive, patient, kind and outspoken. She works hard for her family biz and her grades. A bit neurotic but all girls are like that. I needed to become a better person.

Started putting in way more effort on my studies, drowned myself in self improvement books, got the motivation to start hitting the gym after years of being a calisthenics worshipping cardio bunny. Grew thick skin, tried as hard as I could for everything.

(Stopped RuneScape for a few months too but nobody quits RuneScape lol)

My grades didn't improve a lot but my whole attitude towards life changed positively.

This wasn't a case of an almost relationship, nothing ever happened. Dear OP of #52354, the hurt you feel is valid, no one should undermine your feelings and I really hope you find happiness one day."
52366,"I kinda feel sad seeing some ex-regular commenters graduated from NUSWhispers. Even though I rarely, if ever, interacted with anyone I don't know in real life here, it kinda feels like we're friends, or at least acquaintances, or at least fellow strangers who post and/or read the same Facebook group. (Hi!)

Meanwhile I'll be commenting less I guess. My bosses have added me on Facebook, so I have to make politically correct posts, not that I troll in the first place, even though someone in real life have suggested that a recent comment I made to be a troll comment, it's only because of brevity that it appears so; previously I have taken upon myself to type wall of texts (I try to be both precise and concise, but when it comes to advice I rather err on the side of verbosity to prevent potentially harmful misinterpretation) when I find that what exists is lacking and/or I can contribute, at the cost of me sleeping very very very late.

This is a boring, non-sequitur post which may not get past the filter because there's no high-value content like scandals, complains, sjw-bashing, or relationships, but if it does, I just want to say: Hello Internet stranger. I appreciate and thank you for reading my meaningless wall of text.

52364,"Recently had a group meetup with some of my secondary school mates. I made a comparison between two friends and noticed something interesting. Let's call them guy A and guy B.

Guy A went to work on his family business after NS. He didn't go to uni because he was very playful, unfocused and lazy during JC days and didn't do well for A levels. I talked to him and he told me that he ""woke up"" during his time during NS and really started working super hard, focusing on his business.

Guy B on the other hand, managed to get into NUS engineering. He average in JC either but he managed to barely get into NUS engineering due to the low cut-off point. However, due to his average foundation in JC, and the fact that he entered NUS engineering not because he had a passion for engineering but simply because he wanted to feel proud about being in the best uni, he struggled hard and didn't do very well during his time in NUS.

Guy A is already working in a bank and I heard he is earning 10k/month. Guy B on the other hand, is earning 3k/month

I could still remember Guy B was very smug during uni days and liked to show off about his uni hall life and look down on private uni and NTU students. He also liked to throw the ""NUS"" word around to boast about him being in the best uni. In the end, I guess the JC student had the last laugh.

52362,"Not sure when it started 

We started to drift further and further apart

Was it me who acted like I didn't care? Did I make you think that I have no interest in you? Perhaps you thought I was too desperate during our conversations even though I just wanted to talk? 

Or were you the one who decided that you weren't going to entertain small talk or me trying to know you better any longer, but still approached me when you needed help for something?

It seems that we are decaying into acquaintances and soon to be total strangers. 

I admit that a few months ago, I started to take a liking to you. I told myself it was just a crush that would soon past. Weeks past and I realised that it wasn't. 

I have never felt this mental connection with someone else before. Your personality and character just captivates me. And we just seem to click so well. 

It was at this point where things started to change. Being someone who has never been in a relationship before, the realization that it wasn't just a crush, and the potential of us actually being together, I developed symptoms of withdrawal. 

I became someone that wasn't me. Afraid of doing something that will hurt you, I became a little more distant, but yet I was always around when you needed me.

I know that you are nice to everyone. That there are more eligible guys chasing you. 

If you are reading this, I just want you to know that I do indeed like you. 

Should I let you go, or hang on to this tiny thread of hope. 

Perhaps I should just let time do its job."

52356,"I am writing this because I want to express my thoughts about what happened during this year's IFG selection. 

I am from Science fac, and I really do want to participate and represent my fac for this year's IFG. I wouldn't want to mention the sport that I signed up for, but I believe the people involved in this should know who they are?

What actually happened:
I signed up for IFG sport X and as usual, there were trials with loads of keen players expressing their interest. It was my first time attempting to get into the main team of this sport and I have been playing this sport for years, so I think I do stand a chance? 

So I went for trials, everyone was given ample playing time and it ended off okay. And the captain told us that he will release the results for the selection process soon.

A few days later, to my horror, the captain revealed that he was only picking 2 players out of ALL the players that went for trial! I was questioning myself why ONLY 2???? 

Some background: This sport have around 10 players in the main team + a few reserves (maybe 2-4?) = total of maybe 12 players.
Quick Math: how about the remaining 10 players???? where did they come from?

After a few days, I found out from legit sources/members inside the team itself, the mystery of the 10 odd players.

These players were players that were already 'pre-selected' even before trials. Most of them were past year's IFG sport X team that wants to participate in this year's IFG again. 
The reasons why this was done:
1. They are good players
2. Have chemistry with each other
3. They want to win and they are confident in winning.

Coming back, I understand that the team wants to win. I also want Science Fac to win. But why deprive close to 50 people the chance to join the team even if they are equally good? 

We keep telling people to join IFG even though they have no experience bcos it's all about having fun.... but where has the fun gone?

I am disappointed at the management of this whole selection process. I know it's hard for me to change anything right now, but I hope that in future this whole thing doesn't happen again. (I hope this isn't happening in other faculties???)

Anyway I hope that the team wins something. If they dun win anything even after doing this, I am even even more disappointed. :X

But you tell me now that I am holding you back. That while I am there, I must cut you some slack. To let you go, be wild and free. Building your network and chasing your dreams. I hold back tears and swallow my pride. Because in some sense, I know you are right. When I return, you must still be strong. You must have friends who will guide you along.

52329,"Hi Op of #52325
I'm not from either of the courses you're interested in, but just wanted to share my two cents on your comparison of NUS vs NTU. Yes NUS is 'more established' in terms of how old the university is and therefore more immediately recognizable by people overseas (and locally). However, 'more established' doesn't mean it'll confirm be the best choice for you. 

Even if the name of the course is the same, do look more into the content/modules offered by each university and pick the one that has the area(s) of specialization you prefer. At the end of the day, it's not where you're studying but what you're studying that will affect how you feel about your course and uni life in general. (And NTU is rapidly rising in recognition and rank globally so it's not a bad choice at all.)

I feel (and so do quite a few friends across different faculties/schools/departments) that NUS can be lacking as compared to NTU and other unis when it comes to the diversity of modules it offers. In some majors, we barely have enough modules to meet the graduation requirements so we're forced to take modules we don't like just so that we can graduate. Whereas NTU (from what I hear and have researched by myself) has a wider offering of modules and content. 

So at the end of the day, don't just go by which is uni is 'more established' or which one people are telling you you should go to (like I did and I regret it), but do your research and see which uni and which course is best suited for you. 

All the best for your A Levels! :)"

52316,"I'm a freshie Com Sci student and wondering about the huge intake this year. We even had three different venues to host all students for our test this week.

If the intake grow even further, can the prof even find enough venues for our tests?"
52315,"Guys, I never attend any lectures or tutorials throughout my uni life. I only went for exams and tests. I even made a point to choose modules w/o projects. 

Should I still go for the commencement ceremony? I scared a bit paiseh like I am sort of a stranger there. Plus my parents might wonder how come I don't know anyone. Any advice? :(  "
52314,Stressed year 1 here :( I'm from cs and i feel like I'm not making any progress and lack far behind all the friends that are in the same course with me. I take hours and days to do mission compared to those genius that solve those in less than an hour. It doesn't help when i try out past year papers as I can barely do them. I'm constantly worried and stressed as I'm certain I'm below average. A high cap seems like a dream now despite the efforts i put in. I'm struggling with studies and life. Help 
52313,#52284 Get an A+ for your thesis or overload more modules than required.
52312,"#52293 If you are lack of time, you can even skip tutorials that are graded. 

Back when I was an undergraduate, I skipped a fair bit of graded tutorials, when I was lack of coffee. 1-3 hour of canteen breaks each day damn shiok. "
52310,"I got so cynical whenever someone tries to sell that ""every school is a good school"" rhetoric. Coming from someone who had to transfer from a sap school to a neighbourhood school after dropping from express to normal acad, I can assure you that rhetoric is just empty talk. 

As a kid that had gone through a branded primary school and being dsa-ed into a sap school, transferring schools taught me what it meant being in an average neighbourhood school was like and the stigma behind it. It wasn’t until I traded uniforms for did I realised the kind of dirty looks I got from random people that made me self-conscious how people really viewed by simply which school you are/were from.

As kid who lived a sheltered terrace-house upper-middle class life, the toilet fights over petty shit, the weekly cameo of the police car in the school compound, the kind of labels I got as a normal acad kid really forced me to opened up and made me feel like a maggot in the mud about myself at times. 

Even now in uni, I do get a bit uptight when telling people I was from xxx High School vs yyy Secondary School. Maybe its because I'm overly self-conscious, maybe its because my ego hasn't recovered from transferring schools but Iets be honest with ourselves, there will always be a little inkling in the public mind that judges you based on the schools you went to.

52308,Does anyone know about the telegram bot that gets you and your project teammates free time? My friend recommended it and I thought it was really useful. Why isn't NUS promoting it? 
52306,"i know a guy who's pretty sweet but he flirts with this other girl. but whenever shes not around, hes flirts (i think) with me. what should i do? should i go for it? "
52304,I'm #52304 here to post an update. These days I just share a table with someone at the UTown Starbucks to study and make the occasional comment when the opportunity arises to kaypoh without being too intrusive. No friendships yet but at least I get to exercise my vocal chords a lil' :)
52302,Anyone thinks the UHC had to automate the queing system when you register? Please share/like this so that it goes Viral
52300,"I have no idea why nus computing increased their intake from 732 to almost 900 undergrads this year. While it may sound good for the students wanting to get a place, but it also results in greater competition for jobs."
