64199,I am offered a job which pays 2.4k per month in a local SME working as a biz executive. Am I being low balled? I have economics degree (my grades are below average).
64197,At what point would I be considered as leading someone on? Is it alright to go out for many dates just for casual company!!
64196,"I'm the original poster of #64196. Adding on to my post:

Maybe some of you didn't read closely enough , but I wrote ""grades, or CAP"" - grades being plural. I was not asking about the grade of one particular module, but all the grades in general.

Anyway I re-phrase my question: do professors have access to our CAP?"
64195,"Many male commenters in #64176 are implying that the fiancé did something morally wrong by giving an ultimatum. Excuse me, her fiancé suddenly has a biological kid. That wasn't what she signed up for when she dated the OP of #64176. If she knew all along and suddenly made him choose, then she is wrong. But she didn't!
Even if he just give financial compensation, that is a lot of money given to someone with no blood relation to her. 
Not that OP did something wrong too, he had no idea about it until recently. It's just a shitty situation at a shitty time.

ps, kids nowaday are brats. Just run while you can."
64194,"I feel really lousy/regretful because I did not study CS in 2012, now I graduated in 2016 from NUS Engine and I cant find a proper job and had to force myself to study IT. Now this past two years, I have been bouncing between contract jobs in a technical consulting company to be abused by clients as contract vendors aka ""3rd class citizens"", I worked till 9pm to 11pm serving their client needs/desires with a measly fresh grad salary. Today, I am attached to a world class client site and I am seeing fresh CS grads earning more than acting like spoilt/pampered ""man-childs"" complaining the pantry is not serving the right coffee mix they had in their previous overseas internships. I feel really depressed and I want to kill myself right now,  any advise here on how to turn around this predicament?"
64192,"Can NUSWhispers add a new category called ""suggestions/feedback"" on top of the various categories that they currently have? I'm sure that many of us have ideas and/or suggestions that can improve the lives of students in the university, and it will surely benefit everyone if we had a platform for such sharing of ideas.

I know there's already a category called ""advice"", but it seems more geared toward people wishing to receive advice. I think it will be great if there can be a category which allows us to give general suggestions to improve the university as well."
64189,"So I have noticed a worrying trend within relationships where both people are Singaporean. I've noticed that in many instances, the male is distrustful of the female as well as overly manipulative and controlling. Now, i'm not saying that this is the case in all situations, but I have spoken to too many girls who's boyfriends or guys that they are dating believe that they have some sort of ownership right over them.
This ranges from controlling what they wear to who they are allowed to see. Also, the way that couples communicate with each other doesn't seem to be very conducive to a healthy relationship as when one raises a concern they have, there isn't a lot fo support, but rather complaining about how much of a burden it is for them to be sharing this. 

I say this as a foreigner dating a Singaporean girl as her exes did this as do the current and previous boyfriends of her friends. I ask, why can't there be mutual respect, love and understanding and where is this coming from?"
64188,"So I used to had a crush on this girl back then (got to know her thru work) and we slowly drifted apart. We do check up on each other sometimes via DMs and all but we didn’t really do much. Recently we were both posted into the same department and I was given a Management title and became her manager, she has lately been rather cold and has been keeping our relationship strictly professional. Would it be a good idea to make a move? And why would she have suddenly changed like this?"
64187,"Girls/ladies ... it seems you can actually tell when a guy's interested in you. It's that obvious eh ...


For guys: What are some things girls do which y'all think are hints? Did those hints turn out to be true?


For girls: What are some hints y'all try to give to show interest/disinterest? Do the guys catch the hint?


Let's help each other out."
64186,"CS senpais, what's are the strengths and weaknesses of the CS program offered by MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU and NUS respectively ?"
64184,"Hi I’m the OP of #64184 and I want to clarify some things. We went out as friends. Yes friends. It’s not a date. I don’t have to pay for a friend whom I just met. 

I actually wanted to ask her to pay me back before we went back but she was just talking non-stop and didn’t give me any chance to say anything. But ya I should have asked to pay back in person so she couldn’t ignore or block me. 
We agreed to meet at Somerset then find a place to eat. I was okay with the restaurant but was not okay with paying for her. Previously when I asked girls on tinder (going out as friends, I will pay for dates) to pay me back they would. This is the first time I have encountered such a person who refuse to pay back even after asking her and even blocking me, that’s what I’m most unhappy about. When messaging her, she felt like a good person so I thought it she would make a good friend. 

She told me that she has never had a boyfriend before and probably never will. Now I see why."
64183,"I've met a couple in the same playing field. In order to keep their relationship going so that there is reduce conflicts and competitions, one had to give up while the other excel. This relationship is seriously toxic! It really does no good for the one who has to degrade. Isn't relationships supposed to bring out the best of both?

To all the guys/girls out there, if your other half ever told you to stop chasing your dreams, please just break up."

64179,#64165 Most of my friends have gotten at least a A- for EE2026. I think the competition comes from CEG students who are smarter than EE students.
64178,"Got a lame certificate from a receptionist for being on the engin DEAN'S LIST!! Was it the same before or am I just imagining being awarded at an event where parents' are invited and being awarded from a prof. or someone??
Just noticed, that the new engin website doesn't even mention the awardees of Dean's list as before. Just a small motivation for achieving it would do a great deal for these hard workers:)"

64173,Anyone went for exchange at Tsinghua or Peking University before? Are the classes taught in chinese? How’s the school accommodation there? Is it easy to find friends etc hahhaa
64172,"Is this NUSWhispers or ""Prof Ben"" advice column?

I really admire and appreciate Prof Ben putting in some much time and effort in commenting and giving advice but the same time, I find it weird that everybody's just directing their questions at him, in thoughtless one-liner. You're asking him regarding your future yet you're asking him via such a platform, in such a non-serious manner?! If you're not even serious about your future and put in some thought into it to be sincere enough and appreciative in your tone and words, maybe you really don't deserve his advice and time."
64171,"How do you guys deal with staying humble? I have a tendancy to have arrogant thoughts but I don't want to have that, and usually surpress it well enough. Rarely, but I might think that something is a common fact or given a major, some specific knowledge are a given, and then I realise it might not be.

I do want to be more understanding."
64170,"Re: #64170 expected starting salary for non-IT business roles, e.g. sales and marketing, business analysts, HR for FAANG offices based in Singapore?

FANGMAN companies typically operate on a SaaS subscription model nowadays. Non-IT business roles could fall under 3 broad categories: (1) Sales & Marketing, (2) Finance, Operations and/or Strategy, (3) Customer Success.

Under Sales, there are entry-level roles like Sales or Business Development Representative which pays low base, and your role is to help solicit business for your Account Executive, which you would eventually be promoted to after a couple years with base+commission. Usually hire salespeople with Southeast Asia language.

Under Marketing, depending on your expertise ranging content marketing, digital marketing, field marketing, product marketing and etc.

Under Finance/Ops/Strategy, these roles are usually pay above average depending on the company. They usually hire early experienced management consultants or investment bankers. Roles include sales/marketing ops, business ops analysts, data scientists. Also an exit option for those who can’t take the harsh hours.

Under Customer Success, your role is to ensure successful onboarding/implementation starting as a CS Associate to CSManager.

I would say that FANG-type foreign companies (experiencing hypergrowth) would provide a minimum salary of $3,000 (or lesser for sales). Currently, there is an influx of such SaaS companies such as Salesforce.com, Spotify, Cloudfare, LinkedIn and etc which I feel the public is not very aware of and I hope to share this with everyone. Nonetheless, non-tech roles are getting very techy as the product you are selling is tech, so embrace it.

64169,"There is this girl that i had known for around 2 years. I had no feelings for her all the while and I'm pretty sure she also just treat me as a normal friend, heck she even asked me how to get a boyfriend and i introduced her to use okcupid.

In the past few months, I had the chance to talk more to her in person and over texts, and I realised I have fallen for her real hard. She is just amazing, humorous and I am able to banter with her effortlessly and I really enjoyed it everytime i interacted with her.

I think that girls just can tell it when a guy gets interested in her? I try to make her laugh whenever we talk/text, tried to test water a bit by being more flirty over text, and also create more chances and opportunities just to talk/text with her. I can just feel it that she's getting slightly colder towards me. She will randomly share with me her dates from dating apps and how they are not suitable for her (but still keeps going on subsequent dates anyway?) and even suggested to set me up with one of her best friends. 

Both of us are going for our internship next semester, should i try and see what happen or just gradually drift away and disappear?"
64168,"Ladies, I need some sort of advice from you! Recently get to know this girl and we sort of arranged for a meet up! However, it took ages for her to text and reply. Sometimes longer than a day.

64155,"Purely meant as PSA, as we've been seeing so many posts and claims that monthly salary of >Sgd 10k is impossible. The salary survey done doesn't really reflect the pay spectrum of the front office roles within the financial industry.

As a general form of guidance, all front office roles within top tier investment banks offer at least 10k monthly for fresh graduate hires (I.e. corporate finance, sales and trading etc). The buyside fund roles are even more competitive, where I've seen friends getting 16k per mth for fresh grad roles as analysts. This excludes bonus and performance carry which could be as high as additional of 100k to 200k. So the overall packages for these guys could be in the range of 200k to 300k per annum in general.

Obviously these roles are hard to come by and super competitive, everyone in the finance industry is gunning for it. It comes with a whole lot of stress and absurdly long working hours such that you barely have anytime for social life, so it's basically a trade-off between money and good balance of life if you think about it (the buyside guys do get a better balance at a later stage though).

Again, this is purely meant as reference for the people trying to get a better idea of the packages offered within the financial sector. For context, I'm in the same industry, but think it's better for me not to share my package lest everyone starts blasting this as a ""humble brag post"" (which I honestly don't understand how it's humble brag if the posting is anonymous)."
64154,"How should I treat friendships in uni? I am entering uni in Aug. Some people told me it is very hard to make close friends in uni as people already got their good friends in sec sch and JC or poly. The friendships made in uni are more on the surface level. The competitive environment also makes people guarded and not to open up too much. Hence, it is better to treat people in uni more like acquaintances or colleagues and the friendships will fade after we graduate. But there are others who told me this is the last chance to make good and lasting friendships as an carefree student before we enter the dog eat dog corporate world. Also it is the last chance to grab your future partner if you are lucky. Can any seniors advice me on the best approach."

64132,"Today I had a meeting with an existing client of mine to tell him about a new policy that is cheaper. He bought an existing policy from me about a year back. We ate at some random Japanese restaurant, and it was after he finished work. I honestly did not intend to sell him anything but only to update him and check out how he is doing. So I paid for the dinner and then I asked him to pay his share, and that’s when things got ugly. He did pay up but he said that I shouldn’t ask him out for dinner? I was taken aback and asked if he was expecting free dinner, I said if I had 10 clients and I wanted to update them I have to pay for 10 meals? I mean the $30 wasn’t significant but I am quite pissed at what he said."

Thanks in advance!"
64129,"Struggling to pick a major? 

The universities are trying to sell you a product. A lot of their infrastructure is essentially multi-level marketing (more undergrads than grad students, more grad students than postdocs, etc). They are always in need of more people on the bottom rung to justify their teaching, and hence research, budgets.

They will market majors like Philosophy to you as ""teaching you how to think"". Whenever faced with this sort of thing, ask yourself ""what can I gain from taking this course here (i.e. at [your institution])?"", not ""does this subject interest me?"". If it interests you, you can always study it on your own time. The jobs prospects for people (often very talented people) in academic Philosophy are not great. Quant finance is a broad subject and it would probably be more helpful for you to improve your econ/finance/math background if you were to pick a minor."
64128,"Whenever I travel, I do not prefer to listen to music that I have on my phone. I rather listen to the engine sound, the exotic foreign announcements, the bustle of the city or chirping in the countryside.

I am more than willing to forgo promotion opportunities and high pay.

64116,Will SoC consider allowing EE IT1007 students to take a supplementary module or test instead of taking the whole CS1010 to meet the CS1010 prerequisites?
64115,"Hi #64097, I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with your part-time Master programme. Perhaps you can share which department the programme is under, so that people can give you some advice on how to improve? You are 2 to 3 semesters away from graduation, more than sufficient to pull your CAP up to even more than 3.5, if that's what you're aiming for. At worst, your current effort would still guarantee a graduation anyway. 

Like yourself, I've done a part-time Master programme in NUS while doing a full-time job. I also had several years of gap between it and Bachelor days so I couldn't figure out how to prepare for the exams and ended screwing up my first semester, getting a B- and B while my peers were all getting at least A-. My next 3 semesters were much better as I started revising 1 month ahead instead of 1-2 weeks ahead of exams. I also didn't had to sacrifice much of my of my social life and could watch TV too. I felt less stress too? Maybe because I did Engineering, which is probably not as difficult as what you're as what you're studying now, but after I became less tense with my studies and more comfortable with the way I studied, my grades improved. It still wasn't too fantastic but I'm satisfied with graduating with a CAP tad shy from 4.0, given that I didn't had to sacrifice that much over it.

Maybe you should give yourself less stress? Too much stress is counterproductive. The main purpose of doing the Master programme is to gain more knowledge anyway, not to prolong your paper-chasing journey. And it helps to stop trying to find external factors as excuses. To be honest, not that many people are actually full-time Masters and PhD students ^^; But then again, it's might just be in engineering. Good luck with your last year! You're almost at the end of programme!"
