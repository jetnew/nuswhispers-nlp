65299,"i am quite confused right now and kind of hating myself.
my female friend has a crush on my male friend. when i first discovered it i find it really exciting and i teased her non stop. apparently the guy doesn't like her back but she doesn't really know for sure cos he did not say in her face but everyone around knows... 
it is just kind of awkward but thankfully we graduated. i found a job in the same firm as the guy friend. the girl still keeps in touch with me trying to find out more about the guy. i admit i am in the wrong because i still find it quite fun to just tease the girl and giving her updates about the guy even though i know that he doesn't like her. 
but yeah so retribution found me and one day i suddenly realized that i am falling for the guy. i am pretty sure he doesn't like me back as well but i dont know why i feel super guilty for teasing the girl. but now i have stopped teasing her and i stop talking about the guy because it felt really wrong. i really hope that my crush towards the guy will end quickly..."
65297,"Hey guys, there is this guy that I am quite close with whereby we will chat every single day and meet up for meals at least once a week. But we have been in this situation for about 3 years and he doesn’t have any further action. He doesn't really talk to other girls. He says he only talk to me regularly. I have attempt to ask if he likes me but he always doesn't answer the question. But I am kinda confused because he always say the reason why he cannot have a girlfriend is because he wants to spend time with me. From the point of view of a guy, is he interested in me?"
65296,"Hey guys and gals, recently I have been thinking alot about my current relationship these days. So I hope I will be able to get sincere responses on this platform. So here goes...

I can't help but feel that I am not my fiancé's first choice. She has dated plenty of better men before she met me but the relationships didnt last because they were ultimately f boys. 

When she finally met me, she was already in her early 30s. We went out for a couple of dates and eventually she accepted me to be her boyfriend. Then, after only a few weeks, she started to give subtle hints of settling down with me. All those talks about BTO and wedding started to surface.

Well, of course I do want to marry her. But the thing is, given her history, it seems to me that the reason why she chose me is because I am the ""easiest"" choice to settle down with, which she wasnt able to do so with her exes.

Heck, if I were to chase her when she was in her 20s, she would definitely reject me straight away. She had her fun but could not settle down with any of them which forced her to choose a damn average guy like me to settle down with because she is over 30 years old already (according to her, ""30 years old is too old to start a family "")

Am I thinking too much/just being damn insecure? Help please"

65286,"Friend of mine studied only the first semester of her freshman year in university outside Singapore and she applied to NUS as an undergraduate even though she had to apply as a transfer. However, she just noticed it few days ago (she got the offer in late April) and asked me for the advice while crying so freaking hard but I didn't really know how to do so. She explained applying as an undergraduate was totally unintentional as she misunderstood the application process. She also dropped out from her uni as soon as she got the offer from NUS. How should I advise her?"
65285,"???? What's the best way to MAKE MONEY in university?

Any seniors with experience? What are the different ways uni students can make money without investing too much time? (""Best"" as in highest pay/hour, and preferably requiring less than 2 hours per day)

I'm an international freshman joining the National University of Singapore this year. I realised that my scholarship isn't really enough to cover my expenses, and it will be a huge burden for my family to support my studies in Singapore. I was thinking of finding ways to make a decent side income. I heard most people will teach tuition. Was wondering if anyone has experience in e-commerce/Youtube/affiliate marketing/cryptocurrency trading/Social media marketing as those fields seem quite lucrative. Would appreciate it if any senior can share their experience!

Also, are there any cons to teaching tuition? Where's a good place to find students? 

If you're uncomfortable sharing detailed plans, would be grateful if someone could just breakdown the pros and cons of different methods of making money and which one would best suit my circumstance! But if you are willing to share your plans that would be great as well!"

65281,"I just realised my boyfriend is friends with a few of his exes on social media (i supposed he befriended them at different times, recently, and he had deleted them from social media after the breakup) and after stalking them, realised he has liked some of their posts too.

Should i ask him abt it?"
65280,"I am #65195's fiance. I am surprised by how negative people are about her decision. In her haste to vent, I think she left out many important details. You will not think so badly of her if you have known. I am also definitely not a bad guy.
1. We BTOed after being together for 3 months. That's how much she trust and love me. And I love her very much too. I am sure she is the one for me. We have met each other's parents.
2. She is a very considerate girl. She only gave me the keys because she did not want me to wake up too early for work. She did inform her parents after she gave me the keys and her parents did not say anything. But other family members become damned unreasonable after they know. They started locking their doors and refused to talk to us. Afterall, her parents have given their implicit consent, so how can they treat her like that? That's so unfair to her. I stayed over throughout CNY and I will be living in her house after we get married.
3. We are always considerate of other living members in the house. We always lock the door when we have happy times and we will wait untill everybody in the house are asleep before we do it. 

You see, she is a really nice girl that wants to have happy relationships. I don't think she deserve any of this drama."
65277,"hello, I am 24 years old this year and I have been single my entire life and idk whether this is very common amongst other people cos I feel like most of my friends have been in at least one relationship already. but I have also noticed a trend that the people in my closest group of friends have also been single their entire life. do you think that this has anything to do with the people that we hang out with? like I see that some cliques where everyone are attached at the same time and had many past relationships before. so based on these observations I feel like perhaps I'm not able to get into a relationship because of my friends. is it possible that my theory is correct? pls comment down below the average number of relationships there have been in your closest circle of friends. (e.g. your circle of friends has 10 people and only 2 past relationships in your circle so the average is 2/10=0.2) my groups one is 0.28.... is that low.....?"

65270,"@65252: This is my experience pushing my way through academia from a lowly FYP undergrad to a PhD student:

The common joke (that is partially true) among PhD students is that PhD students are the low-cost labour of academia. My stipend is lower than fast food workers working 8 hours/day, 5 days a week; and I have to work longer, into odd hours, and depending on the type of work, can be quite dangerous (fryer burns vs chemical burns?). In this context, FYP students are practically free data-entry type temporary workers. What usually happens is a post-doc or PhD student has a small part of their work that they need to get done but does not have the time to do it, so a FYP student gets the task.

How big or small, routine or novel the task is depends a lot on the lab. In general, the bigger the lab, the smaller, more specific (even routine), and easier the project. The smaller the lab, the bigger, less specific, harder, and more frustrating the project. Granted, it might make more sense to hire a Research Assistant (RA) to do that specific task onwards instead of having to get an FYP student and train him/her over and over again. Remember that FYP students do not cost much to the lab, the cost of the research need to be paid anyway, so what is really the incentive to hire someone? Besides, it is not easy to hire a RA with a specific set of skills; it is not uncommon to get a FYP student and if he/she is good at the job, get hired as a RA. That was how I get my first job, and other 2 RAs after me in the same lab got hired. 

That's just how academia works. In the private sector, sometimes, you need to start as an unpaid intern doing things like photocopying and paperworks for a chance to get hired."
65268,"To #65268
I can relate to how you are feeling. I, too, became a person that I'd despise during my pursuit of an impossible (in retrospect) relationship.

The greatest regret I made was thinking that I could change myself to become better and worthy of her. I did everything to make amends, to make things better, to change whatever that was a problem to her. As I've realised by this point, my naive motivation was wrong. I should become a better me for myself, and respect this lady's choice at the end whether this ""new me"" is someone she'd be interested in.

Not gonna go into detail but basically it was a horrible experience. This experienced had caused so much pain and trauma to a point that I had to seek professional psychiatry help to curb my suicidal thoughts. I'm at a way better position psychologically and mentally now but remnants of this past still haunts me. I get into this momentary state of anxiety and panic attacks when I encounter someone with a similar back view, until I take a closer look to make sure that it's not the same person. I happened to be in the same place with this person by chance at an event and I had to immediately dismiss myself after a while because I had difficulty breathing and started to become dizzy upon the sight of her.

The pain is real, the self loathe is very damaging to your body and mental health. Please do seek professional help if you need it. It's going to take some time to find yourself, but just trust that this experience helps you find who you truly are; your values, your mindfulness and what you stand for. It helps make you grow into a better person. It takes some time to heal from it but know what, don’t rush it. I don’t ever want to see that person ever again, not because I hate her but because I don’t think I’m ready to face that person yet at my current mental state. All that said, I’m grateful for this person for breaking me down, to give me a chance to build myself back up bit by bit, and understanding myself better. 

All the best to you OP of #65268, grow to become a better, kinder and more person. And I’m sure someone right would step into your life at some point, but make sure you’re ready for her. :)"
65264,"How do you deal with a long distance crush?
I have this huge crush on a guy and I know he likes me too (I alr confessed), but the problem is I’m currently studying in Hong Kong and probably won’t be back for the next 2 years. Since we live so far away from each other, we agree to just stay friends and see how things will turn out. I think he doesn’t want to be my bf just yet cuz he doesn’t like me that much to risk being in a LDR, but I really do like him and want us to work out. To make matter worse we’ve been talking less and less ever since I left town (we used to chat daily, now once every 2-3weeks).

after orientation and all, i kindda got interested to a girl i met and we kindda clicked and all, and after awhile, we got together. we've been steady for awhile already and she's kindda initiating more...physical intimacy. i still haven't told her about the ex-bf part, but do you think she will mind if i'm not a virgin cause i've done it with a guy?"

65252,"*Please don't censor this. This feedback must get through.

I have thoroughly lost all faith in the electrical engineering education at NUS. As a recent graduate, I noticed that the awards and As for the final year projects were given out to projects that simply replicate past research, be it everyone merely blindly applying machine learning and neural network algorithms, or projects that even high school students could complete. The implementations are executed perfectly but there is zero original content. These projects slip through because of differing standards between examiners and a useless rubric with poor English. But I don't blame the students at all. There is simply no longer a spirit of mentorship where professors guide students to conduct genuine research. Undergraduates are instead seen as a burden to be graduated as soon as possible. It is not a surprise that Singapore finds herself lacking in research talent in this area when the standards are set so low. And yet, here we are complaining about how foreign engineers depress salaries. I sincerely hope that NUS Engineering wakes their idea up (or finds their Prof. Ben) before the dearth of engineering talent continues. To my fellow graduates, there is a wealth of opportunity outside  Singapore. Hone your expertise overseas, craft a niche for yourself and you'll find yourself in demand.

So, Loved One 1 (aka LO1) has always been with me since we grow up together. But recently, she has been pushing me away despite how close we are.. This happened when Loved One 2 (aka LO2) appeared in my life who is now part of my very first relationship.

I have been reassuring LO1 that I will still spend time with her n all.. And that nothing has changed between us. But knowing her unable-to-accept-changes (Like can't accept the truth yet..), I feel that she is pushing me away first to avoid me pushing her away. But I don't have any intention to do that at all.. *sigh*

65237,"A few years ago, the 3 of you asked me to do a Special Term module. This one had 1.5 times the workload for a group of 4 and half the time to complete it. Now, not all of us are equally strong in this field. That's fine, I just need one person to deal with the hardware while I deal with the software, and the rest can do the remaining stuff. 

And what happened to the best one among you to do it? After submitting the application form, you told us that you were going to work outside. Working outside while taking ST modules was a direct violation of department policy - it was explicitly mentioned on the forms we submitted, but you did it anyway. And this was before NUS would refund us Special Term fees if we graduated on time, so we were all paying out of pocket for that. But fine, I kept quiet. Friends, right? And so I ended up doing both the software and hardware day and night, even though by now there was not much point in doing Special Term if I'm going to end up soloing most of it.

But while I was part of the struggle, I wasn't part of the celebrations. Instead you all threw me aside the moment I was no longer of any use to you. Right after graduation, you all went to Japan without me, and to top it all off, probably with the profits gotten off me, too. You could have at least let me know about the trip if you didn't think I should go. But instead everyone else seemed to know what was going on except me.

By now, all the evidence showed that all along, you all took me as nothing more than a useful idiot. But I still gave you all the benefit of the doubt. Later when we met again, I was even prepared to compromise and let you all talk about the trip, though only for a while, despite all this. And you went ahead and talked about only that for the whole night, as if I needed any reminding.

For those that came to talk to me about it, even those not involved in the whole issue, I thank you for that, and at least we can move on. But ultimately, the rest of you have shown absolutely zero remorse for your actions.

You could have stepped up to take charge of the project, but instead I had one guy that went to moonlight.

You could have asked me along for the trip, but instead you all decided that I wasn't worthy. Except maybe for funding your trip.

You could have at least told me about it then. But no, I was ranked below everyone else, fit for nothing but clearing your shit.

You could have talked about just about anything else when we next met, but instead you all still had the cheek to talk about the trip non-stop for more than 3 hours in my presence, on top of everything you did.

And even after all that, at a minimum, you could have apologized. Some did, some didn't. And some of you decided to cut me off entirely on all social media channels, which is why I'm posting this here. 
Still think you did nothing wrong? Go and tell NUS about what you did. I've held onto this for too long."

Recently our circle of friends (or Instagram stories) have multiple marriage videos popping up and she's been dropping very non-subtle hints about the future.

My parents split when I was younger and I've never seen marriage as a milestone of success in a relationship (not saying I would not want to get married). How do I tell her that I would want to focus on my career first but at the same time assure her marriage is definitely on the cards in the near future(perhaps 3-5 years later?)

I love her but every time she gets started on marriage it turns me off. I service my own humble small condo apartment so BTO/house isn't a problem for me.

In our Singapore society, people at this age would usually have graduated from university and started working. They start doing the adult stuffs, like give their grandparents, parents money every month from their salary, save up for bto etc.

Just some background info, im a male and i was from a jc. But due to poor a level results, i die also dont want to go private uni.

65211,"Dear OP of #65211, you really have no right to shame others for not being virgins. We all choose which set of values to follow and last time I checked, there was no absolute set we must all abide by. People complained about #65189 because the OP's girlfriend doesn't deserve to be looked down upon by her partner - nobody deserves that, it's a sure recipe for failure and it has a lot of potential for trauma too.

If virginity is important to you, please look for a virgin partner without insulting people with different opinions. I would advise being clear about it from the start to avoid disappointment for both you and the other party. After all, we live in the 21st century where people have pre-marital sex on a regular basis, and usually, the first relationship one has doesn't last forever. I'll take the opportunity to highlight that as you grow older, your options will most likely reduce to unattractive people (who couldn't find a partner earlier) or very late bloomers.

Lastly, do consider you too could end up a non-virgin at the end of a relationship, so don't be too hard on yourself if that happens! In the meantime, you could show some compassion for the people who weren't lucky enough to get it right on their first try."

Some of the guys that I've dated (or went on dates with) had a problem with me not wanting to sleep with them early on in the relationship, and I ended those r/s-es at that moment because it's basically a mismatch between two people. I might have changed my mind later on, but being physical was important to them at the time so I didn't want them to wait for something that may or may not happen.

I'm not religious or anything but my biggest reason for still staying a virgin is because I'm scared of STDs. Like everyone else, I do not like diseases, lol. Even a common cold gives me so much stress. Of course, I do have sexual desires but the fear of std's has been bugging me quite a lot.

Would it be weird or disrespectful to ask for STD checkups before having sex with someone? These checkups seem quite costly, with the packages including HPV scans (the most important one!) going at 300+ and HIV scans costing you another 100. I wouldn’t mind chipping in half the costs since I don’t need a checkup, but it just doesn’t feel culturally common for people to ask for STD checkup reports before having sex. I'm also saving up for hpv vaccines but that vaccine takes 6 months to administrate fully."

65205,"I really want to ask advice. I met this one guy on one occasion, and I kinda had a crush on him. Long story short, he got drunk one night, messaged and called me while confessing that he liked me. I do know that he has tendency to be more open under alcohol influence. When he was sober, I asked him whether he remembered the things he said the other night. He did. But, he won't confirm his confession, so how am I supposed to react? I feel being left hanging."
65202,Has anyone met this situation? The semester is beginning in one month and yet haven't got a reply from the uni. What does this mean?
65200,"How do you deal with loneliness?

It's not that I don't know how to socialize or haven't put in the effort - I've joined CCAs, committees, and camps (both as participant and OGL), and met a lot of people...but in the end, they're merely acquaintances. People I can have short convos with, but can't confide in or relate to on a deeper level. My close friends from pre-uni have mostly drifted apart, and it's defo gonna be harder to meet new people in the later years of uni and in the working world.

I'm just totally lost and emotionally drained at this point. It feels like I might just have to resign myself to a life of solitude..."
