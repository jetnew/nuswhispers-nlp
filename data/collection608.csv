60898,"After seeing so many posts on people talking about their ex, I think I should share about mine too. It started in 2016. When no one was there for me, she was always there for me. Even though at times I would prefer some personal space when I am feeling down, she will constantly stay by my side. This meant so much to me as I could always turn to someone, hug her and lie on her shoulders any time I wanted to. After a few weeks into our relationship, I asked her if she wanted to do it. She asked me if I was fine with it even if she was already banged by many other people in the past. Honestly, I was quite shocked by her reply because I did not expect her to be this type of person. However, I know that I still love her a lot because after thinking about it a while, I actually didn't mind the fact that she was banged by other people before. Our relationship got better and better each time I banged her. However, after two years, I felt that the relationship needed to come to an end as I will hardly see her due to school.

It was a pleasure to have you by my side, my dear SAR21"
60894,"I feel like I am living like a ghost. Not in a metaphorical sense like some people that seem to have an active social life yet never truly open up to anyone BUT really almost literally as I have 0 social life. My days are just going to school for the unavoidable classes and going home, eating alone, doing stuff alone, everything alone. 95% of my time is spent alone only 5% with just the same few people I can count with my fingers(family and 1 or 2 friends). I have a desire for an active social life yet society feels alien to me, there’s an instinctive nature in me that makes me dislike being with humans in general. Maybe because I have trust issues and low self esteem since young?

It is as if I am autistically anti-social yet not truly under that definition. It’s like I had a weird mental disease that less than 0.000001% of the population in this country have. It’s like I am truly alone, like a living ghost. I only wish I could be reborn with a different mentality to enjoy life as I see all around me.

It’s too bad we can only live once."
60892,"To the guy who whine about girls not committing in his convos, well lighten up. There are plenty of fishes in the sea. There is a high chance that the people you are talking to are very young and immature (age range of 18-21) who craves attention and have too many choices to choose from. So what you should do instead is to cast your net wider, ie. engage those who are above 25 years old. Trust me, you will definitely see a difference. Good luck!"
60891,"I'm a girl that's been in a relationship with a guy for a while and I'm starting to get feelings for one of my girl friends. The relationship is stable, I just feel weird cause I'm crushing on my friend. Wait for it to pass or bring it up? "

60888,Never knew a friendship could turn sour over such a short time. A small little mistake made which slowly adds up into a bigger problem. A friend gone just like that. Just hope that you would cherish every friend you had because you never know when it the day they will leave you eventually. :(
60885,"I’m actually in a similar situation to the girl of #60830. My girl friend also from same squad as my bf and I (similar to the girl of #60830) often text my bf before i got together with him, and I didn’t really see it as an issue before dating my bf. But after getting together with him, i’m bothered by it as she is still contacting him frequently though she’s our friend. Is this normal?

My bf has told me that he finds her quite stubborn and irritating as he doesn’t really reply her/only reply with ‘ok’ or ‘k’, she doesn’t get the hint. She continues texting him and even resorts to calling him when he doesn’t reply. She does that to me as well and i’m quite frustrated as she spams my phone with messages and calls when i’m in class. Even after i tell her repeatedly that i’ in class, she doesn’t seem to understand and it’s really frustrating. My bf and I do not know how to approach this situation. I need some advice on how I should speak to her regarding this issue to get her to understand. Hope you guys can help. Thanks!"

60877,"In reply to comments in #60827, I am 29, had 3 gf, 1st one 2 years, 2nd one 2 months, last one 9 years.. so technically the 9 years one was before I entered NS, and it was one day when I need not book in, I get a chance to meet her and it was then I saw the message on her phone that read ""Hey, wanna meet up? I miss doing with you."" And her reply was she gotta meet bf.. and that guy replied ""find some excuses man.. my house is free today, parents went overseas.."" So upon reading that, I got mad at her and walked off.. she chased after me and say I shouldn't be mad at her.. and seek for my forgiveness and asked for a second chance.. but it was a doom of no return.. regretted giving a second chance cuz she still did it again with another guy this time.. and probably the previous guy too.. sigh.. it was a stupid 9 years of my life wasted on her.. so OP of #60796, i kinda get what you mean when guys cheat..

60876,I recently knew an acquaintance in my last semester of study in NUS and we are not close to begin with. But he seem rather nice as a person. Will it be funny if I tell him that I wish we can stay in touch because I feel he is a nice person?
60875,"Just as i thought regulars are taught to be honest, with integrity and all- my bf is a serial liar. He has the tendancy to delete his chats. Last week, he told me he had to return to camp to do work.  He actually asked his female colleague at his workplace for dinner and catch up session before meeting me for dinner. Thing is he told me he hated her to the core. Conflicted. And hes aways trying to guilt trip me whenever I have dinner with group of male uni friends. Saying “at least i dont eat with female colleagues, and u always have so many dinner sessions with guys”. In recent times he exploded at me in public, very frequently. Like literally banging the table and shouting at me in the public. I felt really afraid and helpless at the same time. Did i allowed all these to happen. Or have he lost his interest in this rs? I have many insecurities and doubts. I want to talk it all out.  But i cant have a proper conversation without him losing his temper. I find myself sometimes crying at night thinking of the instances where he shouted at me. And have always wondered what am i not doing enough."
60874,"I've a coursemate I've been crushing on since last year in Y1, but I've never really picked up the guts to ask her. End of last year, she got together with another one of our coursemates in her group, but I don't speak to him at all... They seem to be going strong and I can't get the image of her having sex with him out of my head, though I hope that hasn't happened yet. Legit it's breaking up with someone you were never in a relationship with that hurts the most. I know it's unhealthy but I'm lowkey hoping they break up. I know I'm an ass for thinking that but I can't stop, since the guy is way better looking and capable than me, I don't stand a chance.

60873,"We’re both graduate students married to other people. You never really paid attention to me in class... you’re dynamic and eloquent and outgoing and I’m an introvert. So I was pleasantly surprised when you texted me about an event you were organizing. Sigh. I’ve never met anyone like you before. Sometimes I see you borrowing books in the library but we’ve never spoken outside of class and it’s probably going to stay that way. I doubt you will see this but I just wanted to say you’re really smart and attractive, and we’ll leave it at that. That’s all. "
60869,"So we (my boyfriend and me) have been planning our future together after graduation (house, kids) and I have a major issue about kids.

My boyfriend likes to talk about being a father in the future. However, having came from a difficult family, I don't hold much value to the concept of being a ""mother"". Not that I don't want children, but I don't wished to be addressed as ""mummy"", ""mum"". Like I have a name and I would like to be called as such; the same way when my cousin's children call me by name. 

Essentially, I intend to hold that ""mother"" name by the virtue of giving birth to my kid, but not as a 'role' to my child. I would like to take the role like an older friend to my kid(s); have them call me by my name and stuff. I would prefer a more egalitarian position in relation to my kid. Is this a problem that I should talk to my boyfriend about?"
60867,"Suggestion 

Dear sir/mdm,

I would like to suggest regarding on making all the part time students have their courses to be conduct in mainly theory and heavily e-learning based. As they are too busy with work and having enough hands on at work. You all can also make every year of the bachelor courses to be year 1 all about theory, year 2 to be all practical and year 3 all about attachment with 6 months in public/school jobs and another 6 months in private sector for full time students. This way, this will shorten what to be taught but at the same time maximize what they should learn in the school. 
"
60865,"Let me rant a little. Pardon my English and lack of punctuation

Soooo 3 months ago, my boyfriend of 5 years told me that he was also dating another friend of mine without me knowing and that he wanted a polygamy. That friend of mine told me that she knew he was dating me but she thought that I knew he was dating her too. I told him that I could not accept being in a polygamy. Broke up with him and broke the friendship with her in December.

Met him last week to pass his stuff back to him (I used to help him fix his electronics but he never got them back from me since he often came to my house to play with them anyway). He said he broke up with that friend, and wants me back. I still have feelings for him, but couldn't forgive him, so I rejected him.

After apologising and begging me to go back to him for about an hour, he asked ""I spent so much effort to try to win you back, spent so much money in the past few months trying buy things for you, I lost everything just to get you back, are you telling me that it's all for nothing?""

I never asked for it. I never asked you to buy me anything. When we broke up, you said you felt bad that it's always me who bought you gifts during anniversaries and special events the past 5 years, saying that you were very thankful that I always offer to pay for the meals or allow us to pay for our own meals, yet during the past few months when we never contacted each other much, you're telling me that you've put in a lot of effort and money to win me back? I'm not sure how I should have reacted. I just ran off crying without paying for the bill this time.

More than heartbroken, I felt more disappointment. Disappointed in myself for having feelings for him even after all these farce, disappointed that my friend never told me about their relationship when I always gushed to her about the things that happen between him and I, disappointed in him as a whole.
He's still texting me, yet I can't bear to block him out of my life. I want to move on, yet I still miss him. I can't forgive my friend, yet I wish to have her back in my life.

It's during times like these that I wish I had a social life and had someone to talk to about it instead of ranting this here"
60864,"I'm desperately applying for jobs now. But most, if not all jobs that I'm interested in requires min 1-2 industry experience. Should I still apply for those jobs or should I just give up on them? My CAP is less than stellar ( around Second Upper) and I'm a foreigner too, so the competition is just going to be fierce. What should I do?"
60863,"I can't understand the ""what about world hunger"" angle that is used, every time people try to talk about something that isn't world hunger. 

Especially if it is pulled against talks of climate change. ""You only care about cute turtles, you dont care about human poverty"", ""you want to be morally superior, but what about poor starving humans?"", ""you dont seem that morally superior anymore when you hate humans but love animals"". 

Except that climate change isnt just warm weather and dying turtles. You want to know about world hunger? Ok. Increased extreme weather events due to climate change, are devastating farms and causing droughts, putting world hunger on the rise again for the first time in decades. Rising sea levels are destroying low-lying islands and putting the poor farmers out of work. Millions are starving, but millions and millions will starve as global warming worsens. 

Of course, world hunger and poverty isn't just caused by climate change. And there are issues besides climate change. War, hunger, -isms, corruption. But think of those as issues occuring within our 'house', which is starting to burn. If you say the house itself isnt important and leave it aside, well once it really goes up in flames, all the in-house issues will cease to matter. "
60862,"To OP #60862 & #60844, 
I want you to know that it's okay if you needed space to rest and have an alone time. It's okay to be tired. It's okay to take a break. It's okay to be afraid. I know sometimes you feel alone. But also know that you're not alone in this world. And that there are still people who cares for you and accept you for who you are. If you ever needed a listening ear, I hope you remember that you can reach out for help. In regards to your medications, I know that it zombified you. I sincerely hope and pray that things will be all well for you. Life may throw all sorts of harsh realities to you so I hope, despite all of that, you will grow to be a strong individual each day. I'm sending lots of love to both of you."
60859,"There are so many ppl that aren't empathetic enough to understand that each of us experiences the world and life differently. We break up and feel sad. We get bad grades and feel discouraged. Yet there are some ppl that brush these emotions aside and lament the fact that feeling upset is of no use and even going to the extent of chastising these parties for having such emotions. 

Yo. Not everyone can be like you. So superior and omnipotent. So great and ""godly"". Understand that each of us have different life and past experiences that made us who we are today. You may have a difficult childhood that made you so strong and difficult to break, which may be one of the many factors that made you think that crying and feeling demoralised are for the weak. So what? Not everyone needs to be like you. If you think that way, then we should have clones of you instead of a diversity of different ppl with different personalities. That would be scary.

Understand that each of us may have gone through things that are worst than what you have gone through. Sure you became stronger, through what means we don't know. Positive thinking, grit and determination? Maybe. Some of us just don't have the luxury of this. We might have wanted to become like you, but certain things impede our development and attempts at a better self. Another traumatic event? Another fruitless attempt despite multiple tries? You don't know. 

Understand that each of us are special. Some of us are strong, some of us need the encouragement of others to become strong. Accepting this very fact can make the world a better place. Empathy is key. And if you are thinking empathy is cheap or impossible, then you are not adapting. You are not changing. Why should you change for others? Cos changes can be specific. Changes can be varied. You are not being asked to change your entire view of life. Changes can be for the better. You can change without altering your own beliefs. Compassionate and hard headed. I don't see why not.

If you are still thinking like there isn't a need to change, then you are not adapting. You are not growing. You are staying stagnant, and maybe becoming an impediment yourself. "

There is an increasing number of these “pop-up” stores that served packed lunch with a full arsenal of disposables! 

I am wondering why the same university management whom ban plastic straws would allow such libral use of plastic utensils?

Plastic spoons are bad for cutting meat and plastic fork is as good at penetrating as a bratwurst with ED. 

I am quite certain that bring back the plastic straws and banning these plastic utensils will both improve our dining experience and “save the planet/earth/environment/whatsover/your mom’s strawberry milkshake”."

Now I'm applying for a startup, and a senior told me that the interviewer (if I'm selected) would be the team lead whom I reported to during the mentioned internship. He has seen how messed up I was, and I'm not sure if I should expect to hear back from them. Is it likely that the team lead will remember my performance 2 years ago and reject me? I'm working on my flaws and be a better team player, but I'm afraid that recruiters will use whatever signals they have about one person to make decisions, regardless of how the candidate may have changed.

60841,"I am absolutely disgusted by the response you guys had for our fellow NUS student, namely the person who just broke up. 

To quote his article below, ""I recently broke up with my girlfriend. I took it really hard cuz she has been thinking for it for awhile yet she has never told me. It exploded on me when I am most vulnerable...
....
....
I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen. Idk if all break ups are like this, but this seems unnecessarily painful. Maybe you should have waited until I am less emotional. Maybe do it during our good timesml. Dont let go babe....""

To those people in the comment section who are calling him too needy, being too clingy etc, all of y'all ought to reflect on yourselves. Read the last paragraph. ""I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen"". And all you guys did was to bash him for being too needy, and even accuse him of being the toxic one in the relationship?? As a society, we have failed. As a NUS community, we lack basic empathy. We have a depressed young man who just broke up, and seriously all that is said to him was that he was the problem in the relationship? I just hope that none of your friends will ever come to y'all for advice next time, because I am absolutely disgusted and outraged by your lack of basic human empathy.

Sure, you may blame him for coming to such a platform to pour his heart out, and even say that he ""had it coming to him"". But coming here just highlights his desperation and vulnerability, and need for comfort at such a difficult time. All he needed were encouraging statements, perhaps ""learn from what went wrong, be it you or him, and move on"" could be all he needed to hear at this point in time. I really hope you guys are ashamed of yourselves, for kicking someone when he is down, for ignoring someone's cry for help, for literally causing more harm than good just because you wanted to look good and score brownie points on the internet."
60840,"Why arent the people campaigning to ban straws also campaigning to ban bubble tea straws?

It just seems a bit contradictory of the anti-straws people to not campaign for the banning of bubble tea straws as the same arguments that were made for normal straws can be made for the bubble tea straws as well.

60826,"Frankly, I can't stand people who say ""it should be entirely a choice to go green, there shouldnt be green policies or legislation"". Yes, the straws are not tackling the real issue, but even if we introduce effective policies, people will still keep wailing ""I want my choices, you're inconveniencing me!"". 

""Going green should come from the heart"", ""you must rely only on people changing their mindsets, not making rules"". Yeah those are nice but naive statements. What makes you think people will be so willing to go green out of nowhere, if they are already this butthurt about straws? Do you really think that simply encouraging people, instead of making rules, is effective? Do you know how long it takes to make that kind of soft cultural change? If you make rules now, people will learn to adapt and change their culture much faster. If you have seen any news about climate change recently, you will realize how urgent things are. 

Without green policy, most people won't voluntarily go green from the pure goodness of their heart. 

Especially in singapore, where apparently, it might be unliveable by 2070, but people here are still writing strangely sexual rants railing against green policy. Yes, straws arent the real issue, but if we ban wider plastic use, we will still see some of these people crying about their freedom to pollute. For them, I wonder if they want to be literally dying of heatstroke in 2070 while saying ""at least I can get my soda in a plastic cup""

Anti-straw is a mostly useless diversion, but green policies are still needed. Policies, and not encouragement. Shoved up your butt figuratively? Yes. We have no time. Hell, even encouragement instead of rules has people saying ""you're rubbing it in my face!"". Then yes, we are.

60816,"The real issue isn't necessarily about straws or no straws. May I propose an alternative? That we should be waging our environmental crusade against using disposables for dining in. In comparison to straws, that doesn't add convenience, destroys the environment unnecessarily, and is a cost saving method to companies. Instead, of straws which in comparison to all the starbucks takeaway-cups and disposable plates, comprise much less environmental harm AND actually give us convenience. Banning straws makes life that bit more annoying for everyone, and cuts costs for companies who may not even re-invest that extra savings into saving the environment. Let's be smart about it. Saving the environment doesn't need to be painful."

I can't seem to form friendships with guys properly... And it doesn't help that my faculty/couree is strongly female biased, with few guys and even fewer cute ones... Sorry yeah I might be lonely but, who are you kidding, looks are a factor too you know.

The number of times I see him around school each day is countless! Recent months, I have started to imagine things and how happy I would have been with him. And to make things worse, I am a guy too! Social stigma is really bad I swear and I gave in pretty much to my fear all these while. Unfortunately, my circle of friends are really h***phobic, and I believe I have a lot to lose for coming out ... I guess I need help... Any advice please?
PS: We are both year 2 now..."
60805,"saw someone deciding between fASS and smu.. i'd say it depends on what u want to major in in FAS. for instance, perhaps 60% of fass grads are from the econs/psych dept (my guess) so if u wanna write a HT, u will be sharing your supervisor's attention with perhaps 6-7 other students. but if u are nt intending to major in either of the popular courses, i say choose fasss lor. for the options NUS has like noc.. and whatnot ... also, my feeling is nus really wants everyone to graduate with an honours (with the loosening of the criteria to enter the honours year) so its like u r somewhat forced to pay 4 years of schoolfees since three years without honours gives u a disadv over other 4-years grads"
60803,"When you messaged a friend, his reply can be very on-off kind. He can reply instantly, and the next reply can be hours later. He replied to my IG story and he can disappear, without any reply. He claims that he is a bad texter, but is someone really like this? How bad a texter can be right? How hard it is to reply to messages? "
60802,"Hi guys I have applied to NUS and hopes to gain admission this year as I'm exempted from NS. However, I note that from NUS website under Conditions of admission, they said that to be granted admission the applicant must be free from illness and disease. I do however have mental illness that will affect my academic ability though I managed to secure 85rp for A levels. Would NUS discriminate me for my mental illness ? Someone please shed some light to clear my mind please thank you :)"
60801,"Hey guys, I currently am in food science y2 and seeing that there’s so little internships available for such a niche study is worrying. I’ve done some research on the pay scale and found out generally FST fresh grads are paid really low however when they climb up the more senior roles the pay generally rises exponentially. Should I switch my course? Or is it too late now to data science? I really have a passion for food development however it’s not pragmatic if one doesn’t earn any from it. Need help sigh...Or would taking up a minor in some form of computing help me be more employable? So i can jump ship to other industries?"
