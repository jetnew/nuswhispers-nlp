63099,"I am an exchange student at NUS, just want to know has anyone ever failed a humanities module before? Is it possible to fail when you SU the module?"
63098,"Outwardly, I have my life together, but I worry about my grades every day, and I think of suicide every week, but never seriously (it's enduring and I wrote this after finals so it isnt just temporary). I'm also often sad and lonely, but never enough to publicly break down and kill myself. There's a variety of issues that explain these things. 

But I've been told by at least two counsellors that I am perfectly normal, and I am only facing the everyday difficulties of life. But I'm so discontent with how hard I need to cope each day, and I wish life could be easier. I've started trying to self-sabotage my life and stop coping, so that I finally have a problem to be fixed. 

How can I fix myself when there's nothing to be fixed? How do I improve my life, change my mindsets (every time I face a problem, I casually think of killing myself, it's a 10 year habit), become happier, when I'm ""perfectly normal""? Do I need to make myself lose everything so that I finally take suicide seriously and have a valid clinical problem, instead of being the lame bored spoiled neurotypical totally doctor-shopping for attention?"
63097,"Hi #63097, my bf is also a poly dropout. I met him during poly orientation and we started dating awhile after. He dropped out after a year and got enlisted while I went to uni after poly.

He decided to drop out because no matter how hard he studied, he was still failing most of his modules. Apparently, he just wasn't academically inclined. 

He then enlisted in army and his army friend recommended him to work as a waiter at his friend's father's restaurant during the weekend. 

After finishing army, out of an interest in cooking, he did a part-time course at a culinary school while continuing his part-time waiter job. Upon finishing the course, he worked as an apprentice at a restaurant. 

He worked very hard and took many part-time courses and participated in competitions along the way. He slowly worked his way up from apprentice to head chef. 

He then went on to work at a five star hotel as a junior chef and recently got promoted to sous chef, which pays him more than what I earn as an accountant.

It took him many years of hardwork to get to where he is now. It's definitely way harder for someone without paper qualifications to find a job that pays well. But as long as you're willing to constantly improve yourself and prove yourself to be worthy, there would always be a place for you to shine. 

Success is not determined by how much paper qualifications or how many A's you've got. It's your attitude that determines your success."
63095,"Hi seeking for advice, my girlfriend is really touchy with her friends (guys) like she would hug them and stuffs like that and i dont really like it but i just overlook it so i need advice, am i just being over sensitive and a pussy? like for real haha"
63094,"Dear Seniors,

Can anyone share if it is difficult to enter halls? I want to experience Hall life but it seems like it's extremely difficult to get in with no inside connections or amazing sports experiences.

What other criteria do y'all look for?  (・へ・)"

63090,"I know a lot of youths nowadays don't use Facebook and only use Instagram/Snapchat but I also notice a sizeable number of youths that still use Facebook. These people don't even use Instagram (or at least, hardly use it in comparison) which is pretty funny. I also notice these users tend to be all boys, usually those who don't bother keeping up with the trends. Meanwhile I don't know of any females that is using Facebook more than Instagram. What's with this gender difference, I don't know.

I don't study social science but just some interesting trend I think is worth pointing out."
63089,"To the OP of #63089, I can totally relate to what you've gone through. Teaching was my childhood ambition and I have always wanted to teach (as my first and last career, since secondary school). Like you, I was particularly inspired by my secondary school History teacher and JC form teacher. Hence, I applied to join MOE after my As. I even kept a promotional material I took from MOE when they came down to my school in Sec Four to remind me of this ambition I had.

I applied to MOE over a span of 4 years. During the first year, the interview was good, but I never heard from the HR side. One day, in August, I decided to call them up after 4 months (my interview was around March/ April) and it was then that they told me I was rejected.

In the second year I applied, I was rejected again.

After NS, I decided to try a teaching internship. It was an amazing experience which confirmed my love for teaching. Thankfully, I was also blessed with very supportive teacher mentors who affirmed my aptitude and passion for the profession. I applied to join MOE for the third time, but unfortunately, was rejected.

The last time I decided to apply, I felt very hesistant. After all, failing thrice made me question whether my childhood dream would really materialise. During the interview, the panelists asked why do I want to teach and I just candidly shared that I had a passion, did an internship which reinforced my love for teaching, and that this was my fourth time trying. They were shocked and asked if I knew why I was rejected. Like you, I didn't have the reasons, although I told them I wish I knew so that I could improve on my performance. I guess this persistence paid off, and I am omw to join the force that I once aspired to join as a kid.

I share with you my personal anecdote to reassure you that others also face similar experiences but have emerged from it stronger, and so can you. It is always very nice to hear of teachers who have inspired their students like you, who in turn want to inspire a future generation of Singaporeans. I am sure perseverance pays off. And so long as you keep trying and not give up, you'll definitely, definitely see light at the end of the tunnel :). Cheers."
63088,"So I met this gamer girl and played with for a year. We joined a new guild together. Met new people got a new clique together. One day she brought her first in game friend back. Life was great, it became surreal. From virtual we met, to real life. Our clique start to meet up. Then her friend became emotional(I think) and she went back to him. From then on our clique disbanded. Life has ended. I want to be an Avenger."
63087,"Should i take CS1010 in special term II? My concern is that I actually wanted CS1010s as it teaches using python which i feel is more relevant now. The thing is special term II doesn't offer this mod, but only in academic term which I would be taking with a few other core mods, so you can totally imagine the workload given the time consuming nature of this mod. Desperately in need of help and advice... thanks!!"
63086,"I am so jaded with love can someone offer some words of solace? I am a perfectly loveable girl, above average looks, capable of holding long intellectual conversations, am kind and caring and would shower my guy with love. No idea why my ex would break up with me after 7 years of a great relationship but no turning back to that now. I’m seeing this guy but it’s a Friends with Benefits relationship and I am so confused. We text daily about our lives and always have a good time whenever we hang out, but he says he isn’t emotionally available and isn’t looking for a relationship now. What to do? We have such great chemistry and finding someone else on dating apps is so tiring. No one makes me happy as much as he does. : ( am i in too deep? stay and wait or leave?"
63085,I am a graduating student interested in working as a RA at NUS. I wonder how do professors view enquiries from students about RA positions? Do most professors welcome such requests or do they feel annoyed?
63083,"Boyfriend broke up with me few weeks ago, and I used ""studying for finals"" as a way to keep myself busy and somewhat happy. Too bad, exams are over and internship is a month away. I kept thinking about him while hanging out, watching movies, reading. I really need something stressful to do..."
63082,"Hello #63082, I think you should just break up with your bf. If you're feeling bored of your relationship and find your bf very boring and mundane, it probably means you don't love him. The exact same thing happened to me before. 

I had this bf of 2 years who was also kinda cute but very boring. After I started working, I met this guy who's very smart, attractive and charismatic. He also asked me out despite knowing I have a bf. 

I asked him why he wants to go out with me despite knowing I am attached. He said he just wanted to be friends with me. 

After hanging out with him a few times, I decided to break up with my bf because I find myself attracted to this new guy.

We continued to go out as friends for a few months after my breakup. We got together as I slowly moved on from my breakup. 

We've been together for 3 years and we're currently planning for our big day in next year march. 

Don't ever settle for a mediocre relationship. If you find yourself wanting to go out with other guys, you're probably with the wrong person. 

Throughout these 3 years, there were a few guys asking me out here and there. I feel flattered by all the attention but I never once wanted to go out with any of them no matter how attractive and eligible they are. 

When you meet the right person, you wouldn't want to go out with anyone else anymore. When you're with the right one, you just know there's no other place you rather be."
63078,I recently got on a dating app and I’m wondering if it’s normal to be talking to many girls / guys at once. Like maybe 5 people at once. Do people usually have many potentials that they’re chatting up at one time?
63077,"I know USP is not a scholarship, but are there a lot of people in USP with other scholarships (government/university) anyway?

63074,Does anyone know how to apply for a CS 2nd major/minor? Can't seem to find any information anywhere ...
63073,"Guys, relating to one of the posts earlier about not having any internship experience. 

Same here, 0 internship experience (except for a few RA opportunities but those were “nothing” because it was all saikang) because no companies want to accept me due to my poor grades (CAP <4, second lower). I am supposed to graduate with bachelor of social sciences (majoring psychology) next semester but I am worried with my low cap and less work experience, where can I go? 

Is it even possible to pursue research jobs because I kind of like research > clinical? My honours thesis project is something that I really like but still can’t pull my grade up.

I kinda believe I have a “no say die” attitude but it’s a dog eat dog world so it’s kind of saddening..."

63068,"to #62982: 

how do you handle conflicts/disagreements? when talking to friends and siblings about their relationships, i realised that something that varies between them a lot is their attitude (and their partner's) towards things they cannot agree on. 

do you both take time to understand what the other party wants and why? when you let them ""win"" (so to speak), what do you feel about this decision and about them? are you calculating/counting each time they bring up something that they disagree with, just to ensure that you do not rock the boat more than them? 

if you can reach a situation where you and your partner are truly honest about anything that upsets either of you, talk about it rationally and not taking it personally, and are comfortable and understanding when things do not go your way, that is a sign of a good relationship."
63067,"Hi, I'm curious to know if lecturers are allowed to plagiarize from textbooks. I took a module whereby more than 95% of the contents (lecture notes, tutorial and etc.) were taken directly from 2 textbooks; the lecturer didn't even bother to paraphrase anything, just lifted word-for-word from the textbooks! And no, the lecturer is not the author/contributor to any of the textbooks.... 

I'm terribly disgusted by the quality of this module and wonder if lecturers are held to a different standard than us students.... Also, is there any proper channels to bring this up so that improvements may be made to future iteration of this module? I know module feedback was one channel, but I don't believe it will serve this purpose well enough."
63065,"Ok so I just fought with my girlfriend over exclusivity. What happened was I texted both her and this girl (good friend of mine) this funny meme that I saw online. My girlfriend didn't get the meme but my female friend did, so I sent my friend's response and comments to the meme to my girlfriend after she asked me to explain the meme. She got upset and felt she isn't exclusive as I would think of another girl when I see something funny for sharing. I do text quite frequently with this girl and we have argued over it too. How to solve?"

63063,"When I look at this certain guy's instagram, I can't help to wonder if his friends knew he cheated on his gf of 7 years. 

This bitch who is appearing so frequently on his stories these days is a snake (from a certain country I shall not name) who intentionally came into their relationship despite knowing he was already in a committed relationship. The typical third-party mentality, if he's not married he is still available? Bullshit.

After realising his 'feelings' for the snake, he broke up with my friend recently during their supposed romantic getaway where she flew across the globe to meet him. 

My friend and this asshole never felt the need to publicise their relationship extensively on social media so only a few mutuals know they were dating before (so steady, so stable that I was geniunely waiting for their wedding invite until this happened), how she was cheated on horribly, and how she was left with no other alternative except to agree to the break up and left helpless in a foreign country. 

To him, she was just a phase in his life. 
Recalling my friend's words about how he told her during the breakup that this is ""part and parcel of life"" makes my blood boil.

I can't help to wonder if he ever felt guilty about what he did to her, if he was conscious that what he did is considered cheating and what the snake did is morally inacceptable. 
It seems like he is treating the relationship with my friend as something that never happened too.

Cheating is far too normalised that its infuriating.

Even the nicest person you know is capable of doing so, which is exactly what happened to my friend here. I lost faith in humanity after hearing about this."
63059,"It's official. After 2 years, it is finally time for me to bade rvrc goodbye :'( I always knew this day would come and dreaded it. Will miss everything about rvrc~my floor mates, the friendly cleaners, RA, RFs, teaching staff, dining hall staff, food and occasional ice cream, gong-cha and cakes. Heck, even the squirrels, occasional snakes, lizards and the bees. Been an enjoyable 2 years here in rvrc!! Loved the convenience of having a room on campus and meeting friends i can count on. Thank you Master Kunle and everyone for making rvrc such a conducive place to stay in. Shoutout to my batch mates. Lets wear the maroon alumni shirt with pride :o"
63057,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me. 
I've been noticing that I get ticked off/triggered by tiny things. Minor things which i believe normal people shouldn't be triggered by.

And i'm starting to realise i tend to get easily angered and impatient at people close to me, rather than my normal friends/strangers, even for similar trigger factors; loud chewing, failure to understand my explanation of stuff after i've explained, trying to talk to me when i just wanna be left alone etc.

When i'm in a good mood, i'd do anything for my family and close friends. It's all laughter and smiles. Everything's perfect. Normal.

But for some minor reason or another, when i get angry, everything just changes. I cant seem to mask my emotions around my family/friends when it comes to anger and annoyance, yet i'm able to do it around acquaintances amd strangers. My conversation tone changes. I start becoming cold and distant for that period.
Why is this?

And i loathe myself for that. The very people who have raised me, who have loved me unconditionally, and here I am getting furious at them over simple matters. I despise myself for having this attitude, and sometimes just wish i'd rather be alone than subject my family to this kind of treatment.

Every night without fail i keep pondering over it and i cant seem to find a solution. 
I'm now fearful of starting a relationship. If i get so easily angered by my family, what right do i have to bring in another person into my life, for fear of getting easily angered once she becomes family as well. Nobody deserves that IMO.

I doubt it's anger management issues. But i'm at a loss right now. Am matriculating in soon and i'd like to get this sh*t of mine nailed down. What the fu*k's wrong with me"
63054,"I had been working for close to a year since graduating. I had also been liaising through e-mail with a colleague from another department for a few months. We worked in different locations and had never seen each other before.

One day he decided to strike up a casual conversation with me through e-mail. Since then we would often chat over e-mail when taking a short break from work. 

We then exchanged numbers. Everyday we would text or talk on the phone whenever we have time.

He suddenly said he had just been offered a chance to work overseas. He asked me if we could meet up before he leaves the country.

We met up for the first time and felt an instant connection. He bought me flowers and brought me to a nice cafe. And that was one of the many unforgettable dates before he left.

The day before he left, we went to the same cafe and talked about our future. He said he would be overseas for a year. He asked me to wait for him. I hesistated but decided to give it a go.

Months of patience and hardwork have made our relationship stronger. He finally came back and we couldn't be happier now. 

One day I randomly asked him why he decided to strike up a conversation with me on that day, which was the very first casual conversation we had. He said, ""because out of all the people I work with, you're the only person who never fails to add a smiley face in your e-mail"". I replied, ""but you don't even know how I look like?"". He then said, ""well, I took a leap of faith and it paid off"". 

Just a smiley face and our lives were changed forever. Maybe adding a smiley was just a small and simple thing to do. But to someone who just had a rough day, it could actually make their day. It's amazing how a small thing we do could have an impact on someone else. Afterall it's the little things in life that count."
63053,"I don't know why this sign was suddenly put outside PGP House. Nevertheless, thanks for this initiative to remind the noisy people who congregate outside the reading room every night to keep calm and be quiet! (Although a little late as most finals were over by the time the sign was up). 

As a regular, I'll miss spotting the familiar faces in the reading room everyday mugging and grinding for finals/projects although I don't know most of you all.

Go holidays also cannot really enjoy coz they confirm stretched their money too thin, stay hostel and all, but must take atas photo to show people on insta that they are overseas.

63049,"I had an extremely easy mod this sem. Admittedly, the concepts were slightly advanced but the assessment was incredibly easy. The prof gave bonus questions in the assessments and honestly, with minimal efforts u can get an aggregate score of 100.

We have even planned for the future like marriage etc. And he had proposed to me. 

At that moment he became violent, i felt i hated and scared of him. Sometimes i think back it may be because of his long term illness that caused him to hit me accidentally, as he is on medication. On the another hand, im afraid that i might get hurt again if i get together back with him. But I can't bear to if he was to have another girlfriend. I feel so so so empty and confused......

63038,"After the first two sems at NUS, I realise that NUS exams follow the 80/20 Pareto principle. 20% of the questions/concepts I spent time on when revising accounts for 80% of the questions in the exam (PYPs are not always similar). I usually spend 80% of my time to do the 20% most difficult questions in each tutorial and discuss some of these with my friends. Hope that I can improve my studying efficiency next sem."
63037,"Rant CS3244 - ""Machine""(strike through) pointless Learning

I have taken quite a decent number of Cs modules, but this one is perhaps the worst of the lot by a HUGE margin.
Not saying that the content is not, good. I really liked how prof Bryan attempts to show the mathematical rigour and proofs for various concepts (although they are ancient)
Uptil the final exam I would say the module is dry and kind of like CS1231 in style but in no way dull.
But well, once you open the exam paper everything goes downhill.
Dissecting the final exam -
There were 6 questions, as prof already had said. Any sane person would expect one question from each topic. (Concept Learning, decision tree, neural network, Bayes theorem, computational learning theory). Or maybe you would say that the content would be more inclined to neural net, bayes and CLT since they were taught in the second half.
But boy, was I wrong. Turns out of 6 questions, 3 are from concept learning. This was taught in week 4-5. Basically if anyone has gone through the first set of slides well enough they get 50% of the score. Wow, so much for the bell curve, do 1/6 syllabus and get a B. F**k logic. Out of these 3 questions, one of the proving question was a direct copy paste of a tutorial question and another question on doing a dry run of an algorithm (findS) (similar stuff was already tested in midterm). None of those 2 questions were new by any margin.
Now we come to neural net question, this one was again super similar to midterm question inolving making some Boolean algebra expressing using a step function. Interesting thing is that this step function is super ancient and is basically a perceptron question rendering to be useless from any practical aspect. Not so surprisingly, I am still not sure if I know well enough how other functions like sigmoid/relu work, since it was never covered remotely in tutorial,midterm or finals. Then we move on to the CLT question, it was a decent question. Though again a dead giveaway by showing the exact technique in a tutorial. 
Lastly, the Bayes question. I had high hopes from this topic. Since it is research area of Bryan, and I found the concepts in this topic particularly interesting and challenging. But this time around, the question was to MANUALLY SIMULATE 3 ITERATIONS OF EM algorithm (read as a plug and play montonous algorithm for which you buy a fu***** computer). Most useless question in this history of SoC. Period. The only thing this question was maybe trying to test was if we understand the algorithm, but that could be tested by making us do 1 iteration also. But no, he wants us to use that messed up formula and calculate 12-15 ugly values depdendent on hard coded numbers and pdf of Gaussian distribution using a non-programmable calculator for 20% weightage of the exam, because this seems to be most legit way of knowing how good you are in the course. Can you plug those ugly numbers in manually, because let's just say that computers are extinct but we still want to do ML. Yay. Maybe, just maybe I can imagine that there is some shorter slightly elegant way of doing this EM maximization question, even if so, then it is definitely not worth 20% for a module final exam which has some pretty cool proofs (no sarcasm) and probabilistic arguments like chernoff.
I am just disappointed in SoC for having such a high varying and pointless examination for this course. I am certain that an exam like this can never be directly correlated to how well you understand the course material, it is only an indicator of who slogged through the repetitive questions of tutorials, is good in ugly number crunching and did not bother much about the extensive proofs in the course.
- a disappointed SoC student, hoping the module final exam turns out to be more proof based, creative and purposefull in future ITERATIONS (according to the vision of Bryan, that the module is not there to make us code monkeys using keras)"

This is what stresses me out a lot. I know in terms of work experience, I'm not so stellar, so I've worked very hard in hopes my grades can give me a chance. But for the places I've applied (ministries, hpb, nlb, changi talent internship, iwp), I don't even get the chance to make it to the interview stage.

I'll be graduating early (next sem) and so, I'm feeling anxious about whether I can get a job if I can't even secure an internship. Especially since I'll have had no internship experience by the time I graduate. :( I'm wondering if anyone else is having the same troubles, and if things will be better when I graduate?

Thank you!"
63017,"Hi guys, I'd probably get some flak for this and I know the latter bit will sound very unprofessional, but I really need some advice.

I signed a letter of appointment with a company two weeks ago, after my grandma cried and kinda emotionally coerced me to take on this job for days (she's convinced it's an iron bowl and she has pretty extreme and exacting opinions on how her grandkids should behave - she only approves of 9-5 jobs for certain genders). She literally cried for days and my father compounded the guilt by accusing me of being unfilial by not following her wishes. Feeling guilty, I went ahead and signed the letter. Yes, I know I am foolish for succumbing to this kind of blackmail that occurs often. But, after signing it, I felt terrible as this was not the industry or the type of job I am interested to take up. It has a 6 month probation with a 2/3 year contract.

My mother later found out that it was my grandma who kept pressuring me and told me that no matter what, she would take my side. At the same time, a company whose industry I wanted to work in gave me an offer too. This made me have other thoughts that I should instead pursue my dreams.

I'd really like to know if
- will I be blacklisted or something from the entire industry if I tell the company that I no longer want to start work with them? will this indirectly harm the fellow cohort's reputation in the future within the industry?
- is it legal for me to inform the hr that I don't want to work there?
- or should I just accept and finish the 6 month probation, then look for a new job?

Some perspective would be much appreciated."

63015,"Hi CS seniors, would like to seek advice on landing interviews for internship at US tech companies. I plan to apply for internships in the next summer, so far I have done CVWO, an internship at a local finance startup, an internship at a US corporation in Singapore (second-tier, it used to be huge in the previous decade), and my GitHub has about 4 course projects and 2 personal mobile apps. I will be able to get referrals from employees working there as well. Is it possible for me to land interviews for internships at top US tech companies? And what should I do to increase the chance (specific advice will be super helpful)? Really appreciate advice from seniors have made it."
63014,"Context: My gf and i are underground because her father thinks i’m not good enough for her only daughter. Because we’re underground, she barely texts back, and gives me very little attention because according to her, she has to be on her toes 24/7 to not be exposed. Is it cheating that im texting other girls but i have no intention to cheat or flirt behind her back? Maybe flirt a little here and there replying to girls’ insta stories but nothing scandalous or anything. Would u feel thats a reasonable thing to do? I’m lonely and depressed because my gf barely gives me any attention that i kinda need. Personally i dont feel i am doing anything wrong or unfaithful. What do u guys think?"

63009,Hello fellow marketing students. I am working at a company where i am required to post pictures of females on social media with my product. Sometimes they are a little racy. My girlfriend has taken this personally and stalks my company’s page and gives me hell about it everytime. What should i do or explain to her so she understands its just work.
63008,"Some companies treat students like we are expendables.

Earlier, a small group of us applied for a 6 months overseas internship in China. The application process seem well.

However, last week when my friend went for the interview, the company suddenly change 180 degrees and says that this is a 3 month local internship, and if you are good enough, we will send you to china for another 3 months to do project.

When i called the AP regarding this matter, he was also speechless af and said he will get back to me.

Eventually, it turns out that even the school was not aware of the sudden change in offer.

Dear company, this is an exemplary example of how you treat your would be staff. No wonder on glassdoor your review is super bad. Lastly, if it is a local internship just say, dont step overseas when you do not have the financial resources to conduct one.

Toxic company.

63006,"#62973 But e-exams are not necessarily a good thing as well; it's so hard to annotate questions with just a highlighting tool (if that is even enabled in the first place), it's difficult to keep track of what qns are left to be answered even with the flag tool, and any workings would still have to be done on rough papers anyway. So basically e-exams won't save as much paper, just like how banning plastic straws won't save any plastics. (Whoops I guess I reignited both debates again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )"
63005,"hi all, i am a fresh grad engineer and I have been offered a 6 month contract position as a quant developer as the person has resigned from the 1 year contract, can anyone advise me on the prospects of a quant developer?

63003,"(from a 1st class honours alumni with 2 times Dean's List) I recently applied for a Master course (in a similar field as my Bachelor) in 1 of the popular universities in Europe. The school is about top 30 in the world and below NUS in ranking. And my application was rejected with no possibility for any appeal. The reason for rejection was given as: ""(the school) gets a lot of excellent applications from all around the world. In order to assure that the master studies can be undertaken, a specific commission examines carefully every application file. The selection process is very competitive and we select only candidates with strong records together with a background fully aligned with the targeted master... Unfortunately, your bachelor in computer engineering from NUS does not fit our requirements.""
So either I didnt know how to beautify my profile (which I admit I didnt do very well) or they really think NUS degree is not worth it or maybe both. any thought?"
