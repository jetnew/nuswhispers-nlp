64396,"OP of #64396 here.
Thank you all for the kind comments, lovely people we have here.

I know a lot of you were saying that if she was a true friend she would have kept it to herself and probably bring it to her grave instead of putting me in such a position. Well for 1, I would have done the exact same thing if I were in her shoes - and I think most people would as well (just like the countless confessions here who die die must confess to the guy/girl regardless, because we don't want to live with the regret of not saying how we truly felt). 
And when she told me about how she felt, she said (paraphrased): ""I just wanted to get it off my chest, I know saying all these now wouldn't change a thing because of how committed a person you are and I'm not asking you to leave her nor am I expecting anything in return, I just wanted a form of closure on my end, to tell you and know that we're impossible."" She was right about the commitment part, I'm never the kind to waver. But idk why when it comes to this close friend of mine... ok fine I do know why. 

To those that say it is supposed to be easy just cut ties and choose your partner, I really hope you never ever find yourselves in such a position. And to those that asked who do I love or who do I want to spend the rest of my life with, honestly I can't choose because I'd be equally happy and contented with either (oh and to the one asking which is prettier, it's the close friend but I'm not going to be swayed by that) 

Anyway, doubt anything drastic will happen, I'm not going to leave my partner for her because if she knew, she will be guilt ridden for the rest of her life thinking she broke us up. But what I'm going to do is to tell my partner about this because I don't want to be guilty about hiding things.

Oh side note, partner doesn't know that close friend and I had a thing in the past, I mean technically we didn't get attached so I mean you don't tell your partner about all the 'could have beens' right. So when she first met this friend she did always wondered and asked me why I never chased her or why we never got together because we were such a great fit, she pretty, knows you well, got chemistry etc. But at that point of time we had alr moved on (she had a partner too then) so we just said like we were platonic af.
So with this, do I still tell my partner everything?? I mean sometimes part of maintaining a relationship is that you keep certain things to yourself right. Yeah need help here with the filtering.

64392,"One year ago, I graduated from NUS FASS with an admittedly not-so-practical degree. However, within a month of graduation and by a stroke of luck, I manage to find a company that was willing to take me in and train me for a job that was completely irrelevant to what I have studied(when they could have easily hire a more experienced person or a business grad instead). Desperate for a job back then, I quoted for a 2.8k salary which they readily agreed. However, given the risk involved in hiring a clueless fresh grad, they offered me a one year contract with option of converting to perm. Over the past year, I have been working very hard to prove my worth and have indeed learn alot on the job. Now that the one year contract is almost up, the idea of asking for a raise has been lingering on my head. People have advise me that the fastest way to get a higher salary is to job hop but I feel that doing that would be a betrayal to my current company which gave me a chance and dedicated resources to train me when I was a complete nobody. However, asking for a raise require alot of courage which I right now do not have. Can you guys give me some advice on how to bring up this issue to my boss or should I even do it at all?"

I've googled this question just now and they say that it may be a foreshadow of a break up.

I admit I wasn't a good boyfriend or maybe a toxic one as she once told me that i was childish and too controlling over her. I probably didn't even give her the trust she deserve. But how is it even my fault when she always wear skimpy clothes? And what makes me trust her male friends? Anyways, I just want to ask, is she trying to break up with me? Should i continue to pester her? Or like what do girls want in a situation like this? I'm so scared she will break up with me."

64362,"OP of #64268 and #64268 here again with a final closure on my story. 

After getting that off my chest that day, I bought a drink for the mutual friend (supposed to get the free lunch from me) the following day, with no mention of the lunch treat incident. My friend heard about it afterwards and then requested for a drink treat from me for her and the mutual friend which I am more than happy to fulfill such request. I went ahead to buy them drinks during tea break today which my friend gladly accepted the treat this time round.

Since she seem happy to receive such drink treat from me, I guess this could potentially be the way of repaying her favour. I intended to get her 14 unique drinks over 14 occasions to repay the 14 different foods (meals) that I have tried with the meal plans. Hopefully, this would work out well!

In fact, our friendships started out with me giving her small lessons (non-monetary) and she returned the favour with drinks...then it gradually move on to random food and drink treats (monetary) with each other, which is why the lunch treat option came about as a way to return her favour at the later part. If you are thinking that giving her small lessons once again could be another way, I would like to but due to some reasons I may not be able to do so.

Really appreciate all the comments given, I will definitely reflect on myself to change for the better to deal with such situation in a more appropriate manner. Acknowledge that a price tag should not be set on returning of her favour in the first place. This may be the reason why she decided to refuse my lunch treat at the last minute. However, it still bothers me why she only choose to burst my bubble of joy at the last moment which I decide to wash out this feeling with ""she just wanted me to enjoy the lunch first"".
       
I believe one cannot simply change overnight. As of now, I would probably still feel uncomfortable to receive such big favour from her or even from others. In the meantime while I try to change, I hope that she understands me too as friends should not make each other uncomfortable with their actions. I do hope that I am able to graciously accept any big favour without thinking too much in the future. 

Thanks all =)"

64331,"Mmmm.... I've been a hiring manager at a reputable firm for almost ten years. It's true that a lot of roles don't require a degree for you to perform well as it can only be learnt on-the-job, however having a relevant degree does help our team and HR to filter out some candidates from the larger pool of applicants. It is impossible for us to consider every application for an interview.

Usually, there are really a lot of equally qualified people (approx. hundreds) applying for just one position at our company. And we have a list of criteria for the recruitment team to match and to decide who should be shortlisted to meet us.

So if a lot of applicants have a relevant degree, and somehow you don't, you may probably not be considered at all unless you have strong relevant experience to make up for it. But now the issue is how are you going to get the experience if you are not even given the first chance to start somewhere? That's the problem a lot of young people are facing nowadays. Because there are so many competing for limited number of jobs, you do need a degree to keep up with the average candidate, even though a degree does not guarantee your success at work.

The problem is NOT because we think you are incapable or stupid; the problem is because there are too many qualified candidates directly competing with you. And often, if you don't meet the basic requirement that has become a norm, your resume will be ignored after a glance, no matter how much potential you may have. And it’s because we have no time to learn more about each and every candidate as much I want to.

My advice for young people is to network with others. Move out of your comfort zone to meet people who are not part of your usual social circle. I can’t emphasize enough on how many good positions are often available behind closed doors. That means you will not be able to find these jobs available in the public domain like job ads or career portals. I know this does not sound very meritocratic but if you are out here long enough, you will realize the importance of building personal relationships to get things done. After all, decision-makers are also humans and we often trust those who we already met personally as compared to someone who we just know via his resume.

But if you want to be an entrepreneur, a degree may not be necessary. But a degree may help provide you some knowledge/skills to increase your chances of succeeding, especially when today’s businesses are extremely technical and rely more on hard data and facts to make decisions and executions as opposed to simply an entrepreneur’s “gut instinct” or “great idea”. But gaining employment to learn about an industry first before starting your own business will definitely reduce your chances of failing.

Therefore if you have the ability and resources, go pursue a degree, while using the extra time as a student to figure out what you truly want to do in life. Keep on exploring and be flexible with your options."

64312,"I am the OP of #64268. Appreciate all the comments, I just want to get that off my chest yesterday. I do agree that friendships should not be built on money as the saying 谈钱伤感情 (money talks hurt relationship). We do treat each other from times to times, however in a smaller amount and we also get thoughtful souvenirs for each other from our overseas trip.

I guess what is bothering me the most is the outcome of returning her favour ended up in a situation unexpectedly, not able to return her favour and also the mutual friend not getting free lunch treat.

Back to the story, I somehow become the sole recipient of the meal plans (a big amount to me), so I sort of wanted to buy the plan from her instead. Thus, I paid her an amount which is based on my typical meal spending instead of the actual worth which she was aware of it. After a few days later, she transferred back the amount to me, which I knew I need to repay her in another way.

As friends should be truthfully to each other, I told her how I felt uneasy getting all these free meals from her in one go or rather a big treat (mentioned in previous post). She understood and it led to the discussion and agreement of a lunch gathering with the mutual friend, with me paying for the lunch. This lunch gathering happened one month later, which she seem to look forward to my treat for the lunch gathering based on frequent conversations, included her initiated talk about getting my treat and she was the one who chose the restaurant. Of course, I am also really looking forward to repay her favour with this lunch treat. 

Fast forward to the gathering day (she invited 2 more mutual friends), it went well and there was no sign of her refusing the treat during the lunch even until I was paying up at the cashier. I also did offer to treat the whole group, however, she made the call to offset the treat amount from the total bill for the two new joiners (Mutual consent).   

The unexpected outcome came just like 1 min after the payment where she decided to just split the bill equally and paid me back. I tried a few times to say I am totally fine in treating her and the intended mutual friend for the lunch, however they went ahead to pay me and the conversation shifted elsewhere. I respected her decision and did not probe further or do immediate pay back. I did not mention anything about this treat or that number since that moment and this was in my chest till yesterday. The three of us still talks normally after that day.

It was like anticipating the long night battle of GoT, with great built-up to the final moment and then get disappointed by the unexpected ending at the last minute....""Huh, just like that?""....I just wish to return her favour. Haiz.

I feel that somehow I am still unable to just graciously accept this big favour (may seem like small favour to other) and move on without thinking of repaying her in a way or another. Like some said she might be more on the giving side than receiving side, so she simply does not care about getting any returns from me. However, I am more like a balance between giving and receiving, thus I am still quite keen to return this favour. I will find a better chance and think of a better way to do that.

This is my first time sharing a story on this platform. It feels great to get something off my chest here and reading some of the comments make me go into deep thinking and do self reflection. Thanks =)"

64306,"Is it good to pursue a career that is perceived to be well below your degree? Like being a hawker, plumber, car mechanic, horticulturist etc? Previously in one of Prof leong's reply to a post, he said sth like if you do something, do it such that you reach world class. It can even be selling chicken rice. It really struck a deep chord in me. Since young, I have always been very adept at hands on things and somehow excelled at those. I have taken a degree partly due to family pressure. Though my results are good, I don't see myself as a white collar salaryman in future who only climbs the ranks. Moreover, I have not much interest in what I studying in. I am highly interested in the hands on trades and I have tried out and identified 3-4 trades which I am passionate enough about. My dream is to be able to master 1-2 to top notch level and start my own business with these skills. But one thing I am worried is that I may be stuck with a ~2k salary for a long time which is not enough to support myself and my peers will be easily earning 3-5x of that comfortably."
64304,"Dear Prof Ben, the issue I'm going to talk about next is one that is a very touchy and sensitive subject, especially among NUS students. Without a doubt, there is no ""right answer"" to this issue. Whatever you answer will probably offend a certain faction of the student population. Even so, I really still do hope to get your honest opinion on this matter. For the rest of the commenters, civil discussion please.

What is your favourite bubble tea brand and/or flavour? You might probably not be a huge fan of bubble tea, but if you had to choose, between Koi/Gong Cha/LiHo/Sharetea/iTea/Hey Tea/Yuan Cha/Sweet Talk/Tiger Sugar/The Alley/any other bubble tea brand, which would be your most preferred bubble tea brand?"
64303,"sigh i am kind of sad. i have a crush on this dude. 
but it seems like he is not interested in me. or in anyone at all. (i believe that there are some people who are also into him)
he seems to be still affected the rejection from his crush (around 7-8 years ago). i heard him talking about it before and he also talks about jc times randomly. i guess the girl is still on his mind. (yes i know i am pathetic but i cant help it but feel really jealous)
i find it kind of ridiculous that he can like someone for so long even though the person has rejected him... 
because i have had crushes before and if they are not into me, i will just be sad for maybe a few months at most? 
i wonder if guys function differently. can guys really like the same person for such an extended period of time? or maybe the incident has crushed his ego so badly such that he has been replaying the image in his mind? 

its getting late and im thinking too much about a situation i cant change. i guess i should also move on."
64302,"is it wrong to not feel like talking at times? i'm considered the joker/centre of attention among my friends so i would always be either smiling, laughing or talking non stop whenever i'm around people i'm close to. but honestly, there are times when i feel damn tired of being happy. like i just wanna chillax in a corner and block myself out from my surroundings. but since friends are used to the usual 'loud' me, they would always either question why i'm so quiet or just make jokes out of me, which i will then squeeze out a smile and force myself to respond to them or just lift my spirits up again so that i wouldn't seem out of place. it's not that i hate hanging out with them, but i just feel super tired and don't have the feels to be high and energetic as usual. sometimes i wonder if it's just me or it's a sagittarius thing..."
64301,"As the OP of #64301, I've one further question after reviewing the sentiments. What is the definition of impactful work to you?

Optimizing ads may be great, it provides opportunities for small businesses to get their brands out there. You may even be granted the chance to write snippets of code to push into production as there are safety measures erected via chaos engineering pipeline, self-healing fault tolerance they say. Would the project have launched without you though?

Seriously, when were you ever given the chance to be a main contributor for a feature which has a WOW factor that makes people ponder ""why did i not think of this earlier?"". To be honest, I'm not amazed by the new iPhone, Facebook updates, or Amazon Prime. 

Innovation at its very core is to improve upon existing functionalities in previously unimaginable ways. FAANG please do amaze me for once in the upcoming releases apart from the next big marketing product."
