58798,"I wanted to surprise my Gf studying in the library but saw her swiping through Tinder. Should I be concerned? Why would she be doing this? I've always been caring, sensitive and attentive to her every need and she always tells me that I am a nice guy unlike her asshole exes. Is she bored? She used to be a party girl and I am her first nice guy Bf btw."
58796,"I have a guy friend and we used to be in the same clique. But due to circumstances, the clique dissolved with me no longer friends with two other members of the clique while he's still friends with everyone in the clique. I have very few friends and he literally the only friend that I have left so whenever I need support, I would just message him for with like 3-5 messages a day. However, every time I sent him funny photos or talk about my day, he just gives single words replies and I'm kind of upset about that, but I also see no point of bringing this up to him cuz I'm not his gf and he's also very busy with his academic work. But it makes feel as if our friendship is one-sided and I hate that. If he really doesn't want to be friends with me anymore through his one-word replies then I might as well just stop this friendship and be by myself, which I'm completely comfortable with, because I despise the idea of him being friends with me just cuz he's pitying me. 
I really just wish for some reciprocity in this only friend that I have. I already know that I'm destined to stay alone forever. I'll never be able to fall in love anyone and no one will ever be able to fall in love with me. So I doesn't want to lose this single friend that I have

58788,"So many guys bashing party girls here. My 2 cents:

Guys who are happily attached and have the looks, personality or whatever to remain attached don't give a s about this party girl saga.

In the meantime, guys who fail to maintain or even get into a relationship (important premise: even tho they want to) suffer from horrible inferiority complex and start bashing on so called party girls because these girls seem to be having such a fun life :)

Fellow girls, don't give a s about all this nonsense. Have fun in uni! Coming from a y4. I really mean it. Life is too short to listen to guys who aren't satisfied with their own lives that they have to start pointing fingers at girls who know how to have fun. As long as you're not hurting anyone, enjoy your life. Do what matters to you, do what makes you happy. And if you plan to meet someone, meet someone who can respect you and what you like, given that you respect that person as well.

And guys who keep posting and commenting stereotypically about so-called party girls, and ANY type of life that girls choose to lead, 

MYOFB. "
58787,"At the start of my first year in university I met a very sweet girl who offered to help me with my studies. Idk if it was my luck but I finally got together with her after 2 months. She was really pretty but something was always off about the way she looked or just her actions in generally. I could never put a finger on what it was.

There comes a time in every relationship where you ask yourself whether you should be moving to the next step/base. So we decided after 6 more months in to sleep together. No sex but just cuddling. Of course, as with every guy, you WILL get erect. No matter how non-sexual you think it would be. I made the decision then to move my hands down. Unfortunately, my hands hit something odd and she winced. Broke up there and then.

Can someone PLEASE tell me why would you keep something this important from your lover??"
58786,"Have you heard of the plight of the boy who fell in love with an attached girl?

Crossed hearts traversed from different worlds 
Came crashing down, in silent swirls. 

The illusion of what reality once was
He embraced it in the dream he caused

Stared into each other's souls
The demons, the angels, even the ghouls

Everywhere they were seen together
They formed the strongest emotional tether

Threaded the path this world unknown
Only to figure who's upon her throne

Let saints and devils hear his cries
Let monsters inside numb the demise

All the memories buried deep within 
He promises to safeguard them, from friend or kin

Because in this heart she'll always belong 
The plight of the boy who thought his feelings were wrong. "

58782,"Every sword cuts both ways. For every con a guy has, there's a girl that shares it as well. You can't control how a person behaves, they won't unless they want to. But, you can control your own happiness.

If a someone isn't right, stop trying, really. If you can't get a date, perhaps it's something you're doing wrong, seriously. Go and broaden your horizons and just go out with someone, like lunch dates, etc. At the very least, you get more friends and your social circle widens, increasing your odds.

The problem is that everyone holds too many expectations of each other. Stop it, nothing should be done only for the sake of relationships. For all my gamers out there, it's like AoE fam. Hit everyone and then go for the one you think you can score with.

Instead of spending time ranting on a confession page, you could've used that time talking to your friends and knowing more people."

58780,"TLDR: Interested in a groupmate, but I am a bad conversationalist. Any suggestions on how to proceed?

I am interested in one of my project groupmates. The project has ended and I have no idea how to proceed from here to know her better. Some options I have considered:

1)Talk to her about schoolwork, and proceed from there (I'm taking the module with some friends, so it's very odd to use this as a conversation starter.)

2)Random small talk (Also odd considering that I haven't talked to her for about 2 weeks or so.)

3) Go straight to the point : "" I think you're cute and I'd like to know you better."" ( Tried before on someone else, got her number, but didn't work out in the end)

Whatever I choose to do in the end, proceeding from then on is difficult because I'm horrible at chitchat. All my previous experiences failed because of that (At least thats what I think happened). 

I know that I still need to work on my conversation skills and there is no running away. Then again, is there anything else I can try which might work?

Of course, if she happens to read this and comment below, that would be the best advice."

58759,"To #58739, tbh not just the guys, but all human will first be attracted to someone by the appearance. You can say that those who are born pretty are privileged but that doesn't mean you should just lanlan.

You mentioned about nerdy look, acne prone face etc etc. How much effort have you put into improving your appearance? It's easy to blame it on others like ""why y'all so superficial cannot appreciate my inner beauty"" but what's tough is to realise that we are in full control to improve ourselves. 

Boobs wise, I have no advice but maybe you can try push up bra or use padding. That's how most girls get the 'big boobs'. 

Acne wise, go try out different product or research on how to improve skin condition. Visit dermatologist or tcm or worst come to worst can follow make up tutorial to conceal those acnes. Sometimes, it's linked to your diet also.

Nerdy look, this is really your fault man. I have a bigger sized female friend and let me tell you she's the most fabulous girl I have seen because she put in effort to dress up and you can see how confident she is. So, if you're not happy with your nerdy look, go follow some fashion blogger. Put on some make up and buy nicer clothes. 

Lastly, treat yourself well. You're worth it. "
58758,"I am in the midst of a shaky relationship and learnt that trust is something that is very difficult to regain after losing it. I met my current gf on an app and we got together as she was attracted to my qualities of being clean, hardworking and most importantly morally upright. She always held that impression of me until 2 months into my relationship, she changed upon certain old text messages in my phone of me soliciting services from prostitutes before I met her. She felt disgusted and cheated by my portrayed good boy image, and the worst of all, I transmitted a disease to her. Thankfully, we went to the doctor and realized that it was just a bacterial infection that spread, and we were both negative for other big sexual diseases. However, this did not make my act any more forgivable as she is an innocent girl who practiced abstinence and did not deserve to get any disease or feel unclean. Right now my relationship is in an awkward state where no words can regain her trust for me and despite her pressing desperately for a solution, I simply couldn’t provide. So to everyone out there, I guess my message to all of you is 1) when you decide to commit to your partner, make sure you come clean with your past and take actions to show responsibility. I.e. taking STDs testings etc. 2) For singles out there, I know it might be hard to control your urges, but abstain from visiting prostitutes or getting involved in any crazy hookup culture, because that moment of pleasure might lead to many more regrets and complications in the future. I am lucky to not get infected with any STDs but I am sure we cannot be lucky forever, as they can spread from skin to skin contacts, broken condoms and anything."

58750,"I have a friend of 4 years (since jc) who has emotionally abused me throughout the duration of our friendship. She always blamed me for all the fights we had. However, i was never the one who started it, but the one who apologises, received belittling and degrading remarks and had to be the one who forces herself to forget whatever that was said and done to me. 

I gave her so much of my time and effort because i regarded her as my best friend. However, i never once felt that she actually regarded me as one.

I spent countless nights crying over her because of how insecure, worthless and helpless i felt after all our fights. 

She even threatens me about the breaking up of our friendship on numerous occasions, making me more insecure and terrified than i ever was. 

With this friendship, the highs are HIGH but the lows are LOW. I couldn't bare the thought of breaking this friendship due to all the shared memories and my efforts over the years.

58746,"I don’t think girls are appreciative enough of the risk guys take towards their feelings when they flirt with her and ultimately get rejected. Girls, I hope you realise that the reason guys seem so desperate is that they know intuitively that even if he puts in all the effort and does all the right things, it will be extremely rare for a girl to ultimately ask him out on a date. This behaviour has been blogged about by ok Cupid as well as noticed by so many people on tinder. Girls simply do not take the initiative and I think it’s high time they are called out for it. I personally over the years have changed my stance when it comes to dating. I no longer date girls who don’t put in atleast as much initiative as guys generally do.  And it has worked pretty damn well. I met some brilliant women and have had great relationships with them. They introduced me to fascinating subjects I knew nothing about or advised me on how to improve myself and my social standing.  They helped me to get over the ‘girls are always victims and can make no mistakes’ syndrome that is so prevalent in society and how many girls either take advantage of it or are simply quiet about it in case they  lose their privileges. About how many young women are very aware of the sheer power of their looks and have a very poor sense of when it is and isn’t a good idea to use it.  So I urge guys to stop promoting such behaviour. Have some self respect and let girls know that you aren’t an idiot who can be taken for a ride and  demand they be more respectful of your feelings. Start actually treating them like a grown up who is responsible for their actions towards others "

58741,"Hi guys, 
I wonder why is it so difficult to build a rapport with my colleagues. I have been trying hard to join in their conversations  but I can't seem to find a right way to do so because most of their topics do not align with my interests. They talk mostly about overseas trips, Starbucks, and other very expensive things and activities that I have not experienced before. I'm from a poor family, since young, I did not have the privilege of going overseas, enjoying Starbucks, etc. I studied very hard, hoping that I could provide a better life for my family in the future. As a result, I led a sheltered life, I spent too much time on my studies and working part-time sometimes, which probably explains why my life is so boring to the extent that I always have a hard time initiating conversations with others because my life is only about studying and working- what else can I talk about?  I do have close friends outside, fortunately, they share common interests with me and I enjoy talking to them. What people do not realise is that I do enjoy making friends, and when I become friends with them, they will get to see a different side of me- I can actually be very talkative and funny... Unfortunately, I only present this side of me to people whom I feel comfortable with. I have tried initiating conversations with my colleagues but they did not last long, and most of the time I felt so fake and pretentious. Honestly, I just want to enjoy my job and being myself... I guess having one or two colleagues to talk to is already good enough for me. It is hard to make friends with everyone in the company, I guess...  "
58740,"Think twice before you date a party girl. As the Chinese saying goes, 江山易改，本性难移 aka. a leopard can never change its spots, party girls tend to be loose and promiscuous. 

People always say phrases like “turn over a new leaf” or “tired of partying, wanna move on to more stable life etc”. I don’t buy it. Past history, although not 100% accurate, is jolly well the best and only indication of a person’s future. Or rather, it’s the only thing you can based people on.

If you are wise, you won’t stake your relationship (which is one of the most important thing in life) against this potential danger.

Go club merely to drink, hang out with friends or enjoy music? I don’t think so... I can jolly well get much more alcohol from maybe say NTUC with the same amount of money, listen music on YouTube/Spotify for free or hang out to have a meal in restaurant or even pet cafe."

I even tried to leave him back then but he managed to make my heart waver. His past really affects me every now and then, with him even sharing with me about how the people he slept with had great bodies, how he engaged in threesomes, and also more of his past through his friends, especially how he can attract people to him very easily. All these makes me feel extremely inferior and we’ve quarrelled numerous time over everything. To try to understand how everything feels and to solve my inferior complex issues, I slept with a few other guys as well, but I still felt empty after everything. 

Apart from all that, he’s really a very sweet guy, doing things for me that no one’s ever done before. He told me that he’s determined to let go of his f*ckboy days but deep down I know that a part of him will never be able to let go of his drinking and clubbing days. I really love him, more than anyone can ever imagine, but I know that I have to leave him sooner or later for the benefit of both of us because I know that I’m mentally weak and I can never get over his past.

I wanted to complain coz I don't think NUSSU does much at first yet took up so much of her time, but I saw her scope of work and it is MAD. She holds a key position and as a result has more work than usual, but like she sleeps so little and works so much she barely has time for anything else.

Got to know her on cmb and continued dating. She was nice, bubbly, energetic and interesting while I have always been, I guess, the more boring one as I have always focused more on work. So it was really a great time for me dating her. We were both of age and the topic of marriage came onto the table pretty quick after a couple of months. She told me  she used to be wild when she was in college but she has since changed and wanted to find a good husband to form a stable family. I didn't really mind despite having never visited clubs and having grown up in a more traditional family. I mean, come on, it's a 21st century. And honestly, love is an interesting thing and the thought of embracing her despite whatever the past she has had made me felt we were closer and I didn't even bat an eyelid in saying ""I really don't mind"". A year after we started dating, we got engaged and we started to plan for weddings and everything. I did most of the work in the planning, also settling the house in the process. But things quickly went south a month before the actual wedding. Guess there were signs before that as I was doing most of the work for both of us. I noticed that she started going absent on chats for long periods of time and started working overtime more and more and couldn't be contacted during those time. It came to light when I noticed suspicious messages popping up on her phone when we were out for dinner. Questioned her about it, and she broke down, admitting that she cheated on me with one of her ex fwbs who came back to seduce her, meanwhile saying she felt lonely with me sometimes as I focused a lot on work and am not as interesting as other guys she had seen before. I asked her why she would still go on with me in that case since I have always been that way since the first day we met as I told her from the start that I have never been that much of an interesting person. She told me she was eager to find a good and stable guy to settle down as all her friends were settling down and she didn't want to be left behind, but she couldn't help but miss the fun she used to have. Sigh, it was a big mess and we are no longer together. I guess what I learnt from the whole experience was that, it doesn't quite matter what each other's past is. What matters more is once you made a decision to change, stick to it and put more effort into it. The issue is that people can change from good to bad or bad to good at the same time, loving someone just involves a lot of risks that is hard to be controlled. At the end of everything, I only wish everyone the best of luck in finding a partner who is sincere to you. "

Other people are happily hanging out with their girlfriend, while all I want is to catch a glimpse of my crush

Other people are anticipating a greeting message from their girlfriend, while I wake up every morning in hope that my crush has accepted my Instagram follow, only to end up in disappointment.

Other people are getting 2nd Upper, while all I want is to be able to graduate on time

Other people have found a job before graduation, while I can't even pass the first round of interview at Tuas."
58707,"#58707 Same anology as the poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, somehow girls tend to fall for guys who are attached or married. Evergreen guys are like a complete turn off to them. "
58705,"All women eventually become their mothers. 

This is my conclusion after looking at my own mother, my relatives, my friends and their spouses. 

Mannerisms, personalities, insecurities, propensity for fatness, propensity for nagging, mental disorders etc.. She will inherit it all. 

Therefore men who wish to marry would do well to look at her mother before deciding because that’s the woman you will be spending most of your married life with. 

The girl you will be marrying is not going to be the girl you will be married to. She will start to turn into your MIL around 35. 

Want to know how you will turn out? Look at her father. He is after all who he is after marrying the woman your wife is going to be.

58704,"Noticed a trend about posts like #58607. What's up with year 2 biomedical engineering this year? It's not like the batch has many good looking and attractive guys even, one or two here and there but they're usually attached.

Are all these OPs and like people who talk about the bioeng guy all talking about the same person???

I'm not saying the whole course is ugly la, but the cohort size is really damn small, what are the chances you have sooooo many people that are thaaaaaat attractive that we have so many confessions about them?"
