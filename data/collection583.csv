I was so mortified! What should had been a gluttonous night turned out to be a quarrelling one for both of us, and we are still not talking to each other now. This is so ridiculous! If you asked me in such a direct and in-my-face way if I wanted something fattening, of course I had to say no, right! Why are girls so dense sometimes?

to be honest my current bf is kind of a plan b. he is this nice reliable guy that is doing okay and was just there after i broke up with my ex. he isn’t doing anything wrong but i feel we just don’t have the spark i had with my ex, however i enjoy the perks of being in an rs versus being a single girl because the dating scene is going to get harder for me in the coming years. i am a practical girl, should i just settle for my bf? how do i get over my ex when my bf can’t compare?"
58389," Recently there was a post on NUSWhispers stating how someone dreaded CNY because there wasn’t much celebration and there was a lot of bitterness in the post. 

I understand the person feeling.

As a kid, I used to love CNY. There would be a lot of visitation on both parents sides and we would also visit my mum schoolmates house. 

I enjoyed CNY until a few years ago when my parents got divorced. CNY then became the dreaded reminder that my family is broken, in time of the festive season when everyone is having reunion dinner we would have to settle our own meals on our own and to make things worse most of the shops would be close by den. 

Ironically, during the season of CNY the streets would feel like a Ghost Town. 

 All the shop would be close and there won’t be a soul around except the foreign workers on the streets 

As compared to the other festive season where one could at least go shopping to forget their woes temporary, if celebrating wasn’t of a choice due to the loss of someone or broken relationships, and it is very real for everyone of us not just singaporean but to those staying away from home.

A Friend sent me an article on how we could help our neighbour or friends who are feeling left out during such a season. Like inviting them over.  

Some of the reply to the post were helpful and it gave me some perspective on how we could approach the situation.

Or maybe as adults we should be old enough to use the time to do sth meaningful during the festive period, for we are definitely not the only feeling lonely, or if it really bothers us tt much to take the initiative to hold a gathering.

58365,"Allow me to shed light on why girls having FWBs is problematic. 

To sleep around casually is to imply that sex is causal. Sex is causal is to assume implicitly that it can be divorced from other aspects of life, eg. emotional life, motivational life, values etc. 

You can divorce from it but you pay a big price for that. You have to fragment yourself to the casual pleasure of a transient sexual interaction in order to sleep around casually. 

Once you establish that as a habit with sex, which is a deep experience, what makes you think that you won’t transfer this to everything else you do? Ultimately, you won’t be a holistic and complete person, you will just be a fragmented person. 

Like what my mum always tell me: promiscuous people are the slaves of their own impulse. 

Think twice before you jump into the causal sex bandwagon. "
58363,"i have a crush on this guy whom i have met briefly for a few weeks last year. i just can't get over him as much as i tried to and we will most likely not see each other ever again. he is at the moment single and i don't want to miss this opportunity.

i really want to tell him how i feel about him but due to past experiences with my jc crush i simply have no guts to do so. my jc crush was a horrible guy... one moment he made me feel like i had a chance, then the next moment he acted as though the moment didn't happen and he was there happily flirting with my best friend. until now i still cannot comprehend what exactly was his intention. Despite what a shitty person he was, i tried to make my feelings known to him a few years back but he chose to ignored whatever i have conveyed to him. After that day, i became a wreck, i could not function, my CAP almost dropped one class and i gained 8kg. (i know this feels really pathetic). my heart can't take this type of emotional roller coaster anymore. 

on the other hand, my current crush said that he had once confessed to a girl and got rejected. i am not sure how bad his experience was but i presumed it must be super bad since it has been almost ten years and it is still lingering somewhere in his head. 

i guess if he has the same type of experience as me he is unlikely to make any move in the unlikely event if he is interested in me as well.

When things got calm, he finally opened up and told me smoking is bad, he made a mistake and he regret what he did. So he don’t want me to follow his bad footstep. I acknowledged it and I didn’t smoke till this day.

58350,"This is not easy to write but it's good to have an alternative view. As someone who cheated (and confessed to my ex), I have gone through so much self hate, doubt and regret after. In the moment you don't think about it but afterwards it's endless remorse and questions. Why did I do it? Am I still a good person, or immediately a bad one because of this? Will I ever still deserve happiness? You'll go through nights of tears and heartache, hating yourself and willing yourself to snap out of it. Endless flashbacks. Wondering if you ever deserve love again. I was wrong and I know I was wrong, but with all the societal judgement and hate, it's impossible to tell anyone about it and you'll end up losing so much. It's really not easy to face it upfront like this, but I just want to say: if you're thinking of doing it, don't. You'll only hurt yourself and your partner."

58344,"I was studying the other day near at a bench along a corridor. 

Two girls were walking in my direction and stopped at the dustbin near my seat. I watched the subsequent event unfold from the corner of my eye. 

One of the girls decided that she was going to throw her tissue paper from a distance (maybe about 5 metres away?) to see if she can prove her aiming accuracy. The other girl egged her on, with an expectant spirit - waiting to either congratulate or embarrass her friend. 

Unsurprisingly, she missed because the tissue paper was too light.

And what did she do after her unfortunate miss? 

She left. 

Yep. She walked right away, the two girls nonchalantly emitting raucous laughter at her pathetic aim, interrupting the silence of the corridor. 

The white, crumpled piece of tissue paper laid right at the bottom of the dustbin. This was when I looked up and my eyes trailed her back as she walked away with that presumptuous gait. The tissue girl even had the awareness to  glance back at me suspiciously.

When I was attempting to make sense of this outrageously brainless event and deciding if I should pick up the tissue for such shameless people (I should have) , the aged cleaner uncle came round to bend over his back (and bend his painful knees) to pick up that white evidence and put it where it belonged - to the dustbin. 

What tissue girl doesn't know is that this same uncle had  came earlier to empty the trash and cleaned up the corridor. 

As a man of integrity, this uncle had committed to his job and sweep up the place for us, leaving no traces of rubbish lying around because he KNOWS the importance of cleanliness and a comfortable studying environment for US.  

Imagine how he feels when he returned shortly after to see that his work has been violated by the most senseless and inconsiderate act of a student who will probably graduate to boast about her college degree. 

Kudos to you tissue girl (and that friend). You've needlessly made someone else bend over to clean up after you. 

I hope you're happy.

58341,"So much discussions about FWBs recently. Firstly we should stop with the moralism. As long as its between consenting adult(s), nothing wrong has been done. Who are you to tell what others what they can and cannot do, if it doesn't harm anyone else?

That said everyone should be well aware that having multiple sex partners decreases your viability as a long term partner and this is more so for women than men (known as sexual market value in the red pill community)

Why?! Go read up on kin selection theory under evolutionary psychology. This is just a descriptive claim. Not a normative one. (ie this is just how things are, not how things ought to be)

So stop imposing your moral judgement on others, just know everything has consequences. To all the ex-party peeps out there, if you have found your OTP good on you, if not all the best!"

She brought him to visit various specialists but they opine that his ED is unlikely to be curable.

If we’re being superficial, he’s not in great shape, he’s so much older, he’s not exactly good-looking. The first time he taught my class, I thought he was so uncouth and I even fell asleep during the first half of the seminar. He’s so clumsy too and my friends call him a try-hard because he keeps trying to be relatable that it’s kind of cringy. But somehow, after telling us his stories of going through some really hard times, I just started liking him.

I don’t know how old he is, but his hair is already partially white. He’s married and I think he has children. He’s probably a few decades older than me, probably in his fifties. I wasn’t even born when he hit his thirties, maybe.

I’d never in my life think of trying to “seduce” him or be a homewrecker, and there’s no way I’d ever do that, but I’m still sad that I have to like a guy like this. Even if he was single, let’s say he happens to like me back, our age gap is so huge and people would think I’m some money-sucking leech.

I keep looking at his social media profile and at his younger photos that I can find online. I even applied for a programme that I know he’s in charge of, hoping I can see him.
