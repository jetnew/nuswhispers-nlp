57797,"Post #57797 reminded me of an issue I've been facing these days. A mutual friend made a joke to a friend of mine, saying that he liked me. I don't know if he really likes me, and since we aren't in the same friend group, I hardly meet him.
I'm scared to tell him about how I feel just for him to tell me it was just a joke and he never liked me in the first place. "

57794,"I am a quiet girl. I don’t have much friends because majority of them. I just can’t trust them. I was betrayed after I told a small secret to one of my friend. And after I opened up and told another secret to another person, the exact same thing happened again. I have only a few trustworthy friends and majority of them are guys. After getting betrayed for more than 2 times, I end up not trusting my classmates. So end up, I become alone during group discussions because I don’t mind doing it myself. I can trust myself but I really couldn’t trust anyone else out there. I am the person that wrote confession #57694. I was so speechless when I was thinking about everything that’s happening in my life. I felt very unfair and I constantly ask myself why do I look this way and not like ordinary girls. I always stay at home during the weekends because I don’t feel like going out. I was thinking how people will look at me when I’m alone. I don’t like the way they look at me. I feel that the people in my class can only be considered fake friends. Fake friends can’t be real friends right? Fake friends is always fake. So I end up becoming a big loner myself. Sometimes it’s not really that I can’t trust them. It’s just that their actions and whatever they tell me makes me can’t trust them. Everyone say I’m a loner. And I believe I am one. I hated being alone, but there was nothing else I could do. Being friendly to them make them take advantage of me. So I end up just kept quiet because I don’t want myself to be the gossip of the day. I hated people gossiping about me and no matter where I go, I am always the topic of the day. For every small little action that I do, it end up become a big gossip. And I’m so afraid that I don’t dare to tell my mom about it. And end up I kept it with myself. Though she knows about the cyberbullying shit but she does not know what’s happening at the back. And sometimes I really wonder one thing. Is she really my mom? Like she keeps comparing me to my sister and even the way I look will cause her to give comments like how come you so fat? Even my auntie and uncles will pamper my younger sister and buy her dresses and clothes and other stuff that fits my sister well. And my auntie will always give comments like you really should lose some weight or next time don’t have bf then you know. I just dislike it. I hated myself because of that. I have ever thought of killing myself and I know killing myself wont solve the issue at all. Can someone help me or tell me what should I do? I really want to help myself, cos I couldn’t take it anymore."

I have kept my feelings for you to myself, for an additional 7 months and counting, after you have been hurt so badly by that guy. You told me you probably can never get over him.

Your sudden indifference, coldness just emphasises the fact that i probably do not deserve you. I am stupid to have waited for 7 months, hoping that i will be out of the rebound period. Only to realise im just a tissue for your tears, and you will now chuck me aside, to look for better guys.

57775,"#57775 Yes, I agree that chinese girls (Exchange students) are generally more attractive, be it physically or attitude wise. 

In fact, I find some of them rather fun-sized and more feminine, unlike some zabos who are either too tall, obese or have the princess syndrome, commonly seen in the new strawberry generation, not to mention the lack of geometry.

I understand that haters out there would call them 'ATB' , 'PRC' '#%$%' etc because these haters are either too shallow looking at only things from the surface, or that they fail to win the hearts of these beauties. These are the jiak gang dang beta species who forgot  their mother tongue.

Thomas needs your help in decrypting the code! Knowing that you guys survived CS1010, he had decided to seek help from you all! To decrypt the code, one need to sort N number of strings in ascending order according to the length of string. If 2 or more strings happen to have the same length, tiebreaker is resolved by whichever string that is lexicographically larger (Z/z first, A/a last). After sorting the string, one would than swap the first 2 strings, than concat the strings together by first concatenating string 2 to N and lastly appending string 1 to the back of the resulting string. Last but not least, one would use rot13 to convert the secret code back to a message!

Input:
Integer N representing the number of strings followed by N strings. Do note that string MAY contain both uppercase and lowercase letters. It is guaranteed that N is >= 2.

He was supposed to leave that night, but our gaming session carried on until the midnight hours, and I thought it would be polite to ask him to stay in my apartment. The problem was, there was only one bed in the room, and I didn't have any sleeping mats or spare mattresses lying around. So naturally, I offered him half of my bed to sleep on, because naturally that is the polite thing to do. There's nothing awkward about two bros sleeping on the same bed, right? Well, I found out later when we were asleep that my homie has this habit of reaching over and spooning whoever's in bed with him. I woke up in the middle of the night to find him clasping me and trying to hump me or something. I thought it wouldn't be polite to wake him up, so I just gave in and started hugging and humping him also.

57737,"This is probably my first and my last post on NUSWhispers. I'm already a graduating student so this is not gonna affect me any longer but I hope something can be done regarding this and someone is able to tag the relevant body.

I saw a fellow student running towards the bus as the bus uncle was closing the door. The bus barely stopped for a few seconds before speeding off when she was already less than a metre away.

This is unfortunately a common sight and I wouldn't bat a lid on any other day day. However what really triggered me today was the uncle's attitude. Upon shutting the doors on her, he said sarcastically in mandarin ""you can slowly wait looo"" and proceeded to brag to a friend beside him how he'll even speed past students if they remain seated during the night shift. To top it off, he proudly claimed that there are times when he's able to end his round trip before his friends on other routes. Is this even a game or a race?!

I can't speak for all students in NUS so I want to make it clear that this post is how I personally feel about our shuttle service.

The shuttle service has been getting worse lately, with drivers driving recklessly (campus security anyone?), speeding through humps and turns, people losing their balance, etc. These are things that I see students go through on a daily basis.

I able to recall the bus plate, bus service, location the time during the incident to lodge a complain but I don't wish to see any heads roll cause of this as I feel that it can be resolved with some internal restructuring.

In response to #57696
I'm trying to understand your pov. If the author is a woman, stop over-generalizing the female population. Some are perfectly capable of doing your idea of 'compartmentalizing' - which according to you, refer to 'separate their feelings from sexual needs'. Women do have sexual needs too, sex is not just for procreation or as a gift to a man in return for the love between them. It just so happens that women do tend to be able to be more selective about their sexual partners, which may explain your illusion that males 'need to get into a woman’s head before you get into her bed'. 

If you are a male, I can see why you are doing this relative comparison. But please do not degrade the entire male population and reducing them to shells who simply act on their animal instincts. Love encompasses everything, including and most importantly respect for the other party. Personally, I do have a problem with your idea of love that a man has for a woman, because it seems as if the 'love' is limited to sexual attraction and seeing the other party as an ideal mate to value-add to his family life. 

Do unto others what you would have them do unto you. This applies to cheating as well. If you take the view that cheating is fatal to a relationship, do away with the male vs female distinction and do not compare like with like with the effect of forcing a difference on something that is in substance, the same. 

These are just my personal views and you are most welcomed to disagree.

57705,"To #57687:

1) Don't be discouraged. I am a CS graduate and I suck at maths too. I used to take weeks to study for maths intensive papers (e.g. CS1231, CS3230) compared to a day for non-maths intensive CS papers (e.g. CS2106, CS4212). I played with Linux all my life, so I understood OS, compilers, it is so logical, but I didn't understand how CS1231 could make things so complicated. Hahaha XD

I think you and I are the same kind of people. We love practical hands-on stuff. To build kickass shit. Well, you can build kickass shit without lots of complex maths. We hire maths people for those parts. We understand computers, but we don't understand maths.

3) While what Prof Ben Leong said in the comments, CS is Applied Maths is kinda true. That's also kinda an overgeneralized statement. CS is not all about maths. It is about 0s and 1s and how those 0s and 1s can be used to improve lives.

Be humble, keep working hard. Even if you suck at maths, just try your best to pass the modules for now. Don't know, just ask your friendly neighbourhood professors, they are really nice.

4) Never forget what is your purpose for studying CS? To get a better paying job? Because you enjoy coding? Or because you like maths?

If it is to get a better paying job, the concepts of scalability, reliability, access controls, software lifecycle, software architecture and design, technical debt, technology risk management, version control, is far more important than any complex maths you use CS. I recommend you to take software engineering, information security, practise your coding skills and learn to communicate core CS concepts in layman terms. These things add far more value to your future employer than any maths skills that you may have.

I have seen many people who have great maths skills, but in the end, they can't speak, they can't communicate, heck, they can't even speak in proper sentences. Don't be an alien like them. Be a team player, be the bridge between business executives and the tech team. Be project manager, CTO, team lead, those roles get paid more too.

5) And if your purpose is because you enjoy coding, just code on the side, in addition to mugging out those maths stuff. Try out new software like Docker, Vagrant, try compiling Gentoo, haha good luck with that man, try reverse engineering software, try to automate your life, try Beets to sort your music collection, try to write your own TrueCrypt software, maybe make some Android games. Those things are hella fun to do and keeps you sane. And these things are skills that might be useful in the future.

6) If your purpose is because you like maths, then well, take a PhD, or do research, I guess.

Haha, have fun coding! =)"

Stay in hall at least once, even if you're just crashing. It's quite an experience to wake up 10 minutes before class and not be late.

Play the board games at YIH (or from the Board Games Club), some are pretty amazing. 

There used to be FIFA but I recently tried and was denied so I dont know whats up with that.

Try the various food places at different faculties (not as a routine because no student has time to travel and eat). Ask around and you'll be amazed at what each faculty has to offer. 

Explore the libraries - they have amazingly good books. 

Do sports at the many facilities, going to the gym counts. Dont be afraid to swim, it's very liberating and while the Utown pool concept is cheesy, I feel like that pool is now a lot more relaxing because the ""serious"" swimmers have all moved to the new MPSH. 

Get sick or just get some free meds. I was surprised some people never knew it was free. Dont we all want to do drugs at least once? 

Get depressed and get some free counselling. They're comfortable to talk to and will help you back on your feet.

Hang out at the new PSS. They have a Nintendo switch with a few great multiplayer games (I have personally requested for Mario Party to be added, but if they find it difficult to... Honestly i wouldn't mind chipping in to pay for the game - its fun). Plus they have their own board games, art therapy corners, and is just a peaceful place to be...on second thought dont go there. I dont want too many people there when I'm trying to relax. 

Hang out at the various lounges in different faculties and departments. They are usually open. 

Run around or cycle around the entire NUS. Nowhere else can you get such great uphills and downhills. 

Drive and park in the carparks ar least once. The museum carparks is extremely cheap if you have classes from morning till afternoon as they have a maximum cap if until 7.30pm. 

Attend all the various events. There are too many to attend, and honestly every event is not catered at the entire school. In fact, the turnout is (honestly) quite small most of the time. But guess what, all events still prepare as if the whole school would come visit. So feel free to attend any event (free or otherwise). Might be hard to get to the more popular events though... But the niche events are actually what surprised me more because of how interesting and different they are. 

Go to the museum, and by the way we have 2 museums (some people dont know...). Its not particularly large but its free for NUS students. And you get to see some cool dinosaur bones + dead animals and their insides (for the natural history museum). The other museum is more cultural and provides food for thought most of the time so feel free to enjoy both while you can. 

Find hidden spots to take your date to. There are a lot in the world and NUS is no different. A tip: restricted areas arent locked all the time... And some are surprisingly never locked. If you see me there however, please give me some time - I'll leave when I'm done. Since I'm graduating I'll give you a hint, some areas are extremely nice places to enjoy some stargazing (yea Singapore doesn't really have stars but who cares). 

Crash classes with or without the teachers' consent. For those in FASS, check out when the modules are screening movies. The movies are often old or Singapore based but some are classics and are still enjoyable (e.g. Psycho). 

These are but the many things I have thought of doing but have hardly done and while its possible to do some of them after I graduate... Its just not the same ya feel me? 

And if anyone else has more exciting things to do as an NUS student please comment. Preferably free since I'm broke. "
