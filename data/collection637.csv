63799,"Genuine question here. 
Why is it so common for girls to initiate to break up when their boyfriend is in army or when the girl is on exchange? 

Yes I know that both will have little time for each other and are in different phrases in life so they won’t have a common topic. And this better and richer guy will appear and get close to the girl, being there for her instead of the boyfriend when she needs someone. Despite all these, I think if the girl genuinely loves her boyfriend, she will continue to be with him. Sadly a lot of girls still want to break up when the guy is in army / girlfriend is on exchange. 

PS: My LDR Girlfriend asked me to post this since she was curious. (Because we only meet once a month and She thinks couples meeting every weekend for guys in NS is good enough)"

Should I do FYP? If I am not mistaken, I will not get first class if I do not do FYP. Not that first class is very important, but I already qualified so it seems like a waste not getting. However, FYP will be totally extra work since it does not clear anything for me.

Hence, is FYP worth spending extra 12MCs credit to do, and how and when does one go about applyin? Through MPE? Thanks"

And when working, temp jobs would want the employees to commit for at least a few months.

63773,"To those interested in doing a PhD, a word of caution here for it is not for the faint-hearted

1) Do some serious research on the group that you are applying to, read up on their publications on the last 5 months (questions you have to look for, where do they get their funding from? How long is the funding lasting? What kind of projects/experiments are they doing? Is the research direction what you like or enjoy doing?

2) If possible, set up an interview with your prospective supervisor to understand what kind of work they are doing and try to understand at what stage of career is the the professor in, an assistant professor will try to fight for associate position so there will be a lot of focus on paper publication/writing, less toys for you to play with. An associate professor will probably have a larger team with post-docs targeting more impactful journals, likely trying to do a spin-off company to justify to the tenure committee for full professorship position. A full-time tenured professor will likely be a more relaxed environment but then you will probably be working with senior postdocs from other universities and supporting their research. 

Next, ask him to grant you an opportunity for a lab tour around their facilities. Observe closely, the PhD students, Post-Docs working there, are they happy with their work so far? Do they look fearful/stressed when the supervisor is here? This will give you a sense on working culture there. The best way to fully understand the work culture to ask for an internship opportunity with them, but if they are not keen to take you in, it raises a red flag. 

3) There two options available to people interested in doing a PhD, self-financed/scholarship option, scholarship grants you some protection and freedom to pursue your research interest, self-financed will tend to lock you in because your funding is coming from the project itself. Do your research carefully if you are planning to go for the self-financed option. 

Ultimately, you must remember a PhD is your own education journey and not for your supervisor, your job is to finish it and for you to gain useful experiences for life. Do your research and prospect potential PhD students for advise on how academia is like."

1) The greatest benefit of having a PhD is you no longer have to be impressed by other people's mere PhD, as far as the qualification goes. I can quickly parry other PhDs' wonky ideas without bystanders questioning my logic because that one has a PhD and I don't.
That was my greatest motivation. The second greatest was: in my parents' generation, it was rare to have a Bachelor's degree. Now a Bachelor's degree has dropped in relative value due to the inflation of qualifications. Might as well get my PhD, just in case.

2) I have already spent 4-5 years doing work and getting a skill set similar to what a PhD student requires. Might as well get the degree. My further PhD courses build on what I already knew so I didn't really have to learn from scratch. 
There was an instant drop in income but since my parents are middle-upper class, I have a safety net.

3) I guess you are making a decision based on the employability of the degree. I have come to believe, based on experience and expert opinions that really, Bachelor and higher education in highly theoretical fields (read: impractical) was and is an upper-middle class and higher passion pursuit. I cannot, in good faith, advise people to get higher education in those fields simply because it would lead to well-paid jobs directly related to the field."

Similarly, I don't think I can preach to anyone to be child-free or not. But I simply hope more people make the decision consciously, and with the child's welfare in mind. I have come across reasons for having children like: ""to take care of me when I'm old"", ""because my friends have kids"", ""for the nation"", ""for religion"", ""because I want to go through motherhood"", or ""because my parents want grandchildren"". I rarely hear anything about the child, whose life hangs on the decision. There was a comment that it's ""your life, your choice"", but I think it's equally ""their life, your choice"", and that side deserves to be talked about too. (But okay, maybe people don't reveal those reasons, and you only see it in their actions when they care for their child. I don't know. ) 

I also hope that child adoption becomes more supported and common in society. Currently it seems like a difficult and rare choice, compared to having your own. But it makes sense to me to help adults take in existing children, who would otherwise not have a family."

63745,"The problem is that we’ve made “love” out of escapism, and measure partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That’s not love. Love isn’t clear skies and calm waters. It isn’t about throwing everything that we have created at blips of happiness. You don’t walk away because you can’t deal with the drama.

When love is authentic, it is selfless. You apologise. You forgive. You re-commit. Love somebody for who they are. Whether you truly love the person or if you love only what they give to you. When you love someone, you don’t just support them on the good days and abandon them on the bad days. So when someone leaves and says I love you, that’s not love. It’s been 4 months since you left, and I still can’t move on. I keep telling myself tomorrow will be a better day, but I have been so emotionally damaged."
63744,"I’m noticing how certain commentators are comparing feminism to other extremists/terrorists groups and I think this is a case of inadequate understanding of what feminism really is. There’s literally nothing about real feminism that says women are entitled to more privileges or shaming men. 

I’ve also noticed that whenever a female makes a slightly controversial comment on this forum, other commentators are quick to jump in to condone and attack her. These girls who speak out are often branded as insecure, emotional, and using “feminism as a shield” to blame people. On the other hand, tons of derogatory comments that are made by other male commentators are largely ignored. (With the exception of the female commentator with the chinese name, I know) 

You don’t have to look far. This forum is exactly the manifestation of gender inequality. This is exactly why feminism is needed. It’s never about hating men or wanting special treatment etc. It’s about feeling safe and having the ability to express yourself, go on about your daily activities in life without being stereotyped and threatened because of your gender."

Since that girl was my girlfriend's cca mate, i mingled with them too. But little did i know she would send me a text the next day. I'm happy with my current relationship, so obviously i rejected her using a slightly subtle approach so things won't turn out too awkward. I'm not sure if she got the hint as she carried on pestering me to the extent where i blocked her on social media and whatsapp and deleted the convo in case my girlfriend sees it.

63726,"Ditto to #63686. I think the materialistic, self-serving attitudes of some (definitely not all!) Singaporean women drive us men to look overseas. I've dated locals who stayed for years but bailed the moment things got tough and the future prospects I initially seemed on track to materialising fell into uncertainty. 

I'm now married to a Polish woman, who accepted me despite knowing I have multiple sclerosis (which was what made my previous ex leave), and despite my continued inability to pronounce her nearly vowel-less last name. To further shatter the notion that only poor foreign women from second-/third-world countries would readily accept any half-decent Singaporean guy for money or citizenship, my wife came from a well-to-do family. She left behind her life of relative luxury to come here and slog it out with me. She also has a masters degree while I only have my 2.1 bachelors; nonetheless, she's planning to put her career on hold to take care of our kids, or to be the sole breadwinner if my currently mild MS takes a turn for the worse. 

Antagonism is never far away when a relationship/love is contingent on material expectations. In fact, i'd say it's better to not have expectations beyond those about character, personality etc. Basically, love somebody for who they are, not what they can or cannot achieve. Unconditional love, far from making both parties lazy and unmotivated, might actually drive them to achieve and provide for each other. I certainly feel that way. I'm more motivated now to work hard and provide for my wife and future kids than I ever was when I was alone, or in past relationships where I was pressured with expectations. 

P.S. for the fellow introverts who are wondering how we met, it was on Chatroulette which is probably the unlikeliest of places to meet your other half. And no I wasn't flashing my junk. :)"
63724,"Hmm just being curious here. After reading the recent posts, I realised there is a pattern: posts that are related to (romantic) relationship problems received the highest numbers of likes/reactions & comments. 

May I know what is the reason? Possible reasons I can think of:
1. Most of the people here have been through at least one relationship. Therefore, it is more relatable.
2. Human relationships are complicated. Therefore, there are different views and people feel the urge to comment.
3. It is the same as movies/ dramas. Even though the dramas/movies are not categorised as romance, we still can find romance plots in the shows. It’s what attracts the eyeballs. 

Perhaps, it’s because there is an intrinsic part of us craving for relationships (I mean most of the humans).

How to motivate someone to go find a job? My gf had given up on looking for job since graduated last May with 2nd upper in life sciences. 

She keep hiam the pay or the job scope, and had been rejecting offers. She had decent grades and there are companies willing to hire her but she just wasn't motivated enough. [That was last year]

This year, lesser companies are even calling her for interviews. Even those that shortlisted her for round 1, asked what she had been doing for the past 1 year. She still believed in the mentality of no 3.5 k for a 8 to 5 job means that the company is undercutting her worth. 

She had given up and now spend her days watching netflix/shopping. Her parents tried to talk her into finding job but she always give excuses like the job market is bad (which is kinda true).

Things were fine for a while but now he stops initiating texts and we basically haven’t talked for almost half a month.

63708,"@#63654 - haha! you have no idea how egotistical and biased girls are on tinder. I for the past few months wanted to have a look at what's it like for girls on tinder. So signed up with a girl photo asking for recommendations for travelling in singapore to other girls. Every 2 or 3 swipes was a match. On top of that, more than usual would start the conversation as opposed to when you are a guy(doesnt matter caucasian or asian,good looking or average) where in my experience no one would start the conversation even if you have explicitly mentioned it in your profile that you are looking for girls who will start the conversation first. When I questioned one of the girls on why they were waiting for a week for me to reply they would never answer the question. Instead its always the usual crap about having expectations from the other side but never wanting to meet the other side's( I wish I could put up the screenshots of the conversation but for privacy sake I wont).  Basically when you apply the same basic expectation that girls expect from other guys, many simply dont live up to them. Many of them have a victorian morality or very inflated egos or  thin skin and think the feminist principles  are like a buffet where you can choose what you do and dont like. I personally use this as a filter for dating girls. There's no point in being highly educated when all that amounts to is just simple job training and an excuse for inflating your ego rather than serious thinking."

I posted once about the issue of work life balance about 5 months ago on January 14th, on my first day of internship. That was the day I realised what working life was like, and how hard it was. I lamented and whined about how I could not imagine myself doing this for the rest of my life. Working 8-5 everyday.

Today is the start of the last week of my internship. Upon reflection, I still feel sad that we have to work every week day from 8-5, leaving the house when the sky is dark and reaching home when the sky is dark as well. I guess that's the reality of life? I have learnt to accept this and can now see myself working these hours.

Firstly, the generation of our (great) grand-parents fought hard to secure citizenship for our race when they realised that they were permanently settling down in Malaysia, a place where they had come to see as their home. When the Malayan union proposed by the then British power, which advocated for equal citizenship status to all regardless of race, was rejected by the malay majority, it was clear that the majority race did not welcome the non-majority races in settling down in their lands (even though the majority race were immigrants themselves who reportedly migrated south from the Yunnan province of China). After much negotiation, the chinese were accorded citizenship rights in exchange for accepting the elevated status of the majority race. Therefore, the fact that malaysian citizenship was not something that was easily obtained, most malaysian chinese thought hard before renouncing their citizenship because it would mean nullifying the hard work of their forefathers.

Secondly, the Chinese used to make up around 40% of the population but the numbers have fallen to around 20% in recent years (and the figures are set to fall even lower in time to come). Brain drain is a serious issue in Malaysia, where disillusioned Chinese, Indians and even Malays have emigrated to greener pastures overseas. The problem is so serious that a comittee has even been set up to attract these talents back to Malaysia (but to no avail). The diminishing population inevitably correlates to the Chinese having a smaller voice in influencing public policies and regulations. And with smaller representation, the rights of the remaining Malaysian chinese would obviously be neglected, pushed aside even more so.  Perhaps most Malaysians who had the opportunity to emigrate but chose not to take up citizenship of the country of their choice have their reasons being that they still have many relatives and friends living in Malaysia. By keeping their citizenship, they still own the rights to vote and have a small say in the politics of the country so that the standards of living in Malaysia for their chinese counterparts doesn't deterioriate. 

Lastly, loyalty and patriotism to one's nation could be one reason why Malaysians living abroad refuse to give up on their citizenship. After all, Malaysia is still a very beautiful country with a rich history. And of course, the diversity of races, religions or even the phenomenon of inter-mixing are what makes Malaysia interesting. 

Of course, the reasons given above are just based on my personal experience and thoughts. Please take everything you read with a pinch of salt.

I am aware that malaysia doesn't have a very positive image in the eyes of many foreigners, especially since the IMDB scandals and MH370 incident etc. I know many Singaporeans who view it as a place to buy cheap items and escape from the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle in Singapore. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that but i hope that the attitude of condescending does not persist. Yes, Malaysia may not be performing as well as Singapore economically but we ought to be treated with respect and dignity.

At the same time, i also do not wish to see Malaysians blaming Singapore for any grievances we face and be envious of Singapore. After all, the success story of Singapore did not come easily and only came true through the hard work and determination of Singaporeans and their leaders.

Reflecting my attitude towards the future for both nations, i want to end off with one of Emily Dickinson's poem about hope.

“Hope” is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -

I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me."
