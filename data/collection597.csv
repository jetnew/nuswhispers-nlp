59799,"I don't share with my friends about my emotional and mental problems anymore. I'm still in good contact with many of them, but I always take pains to keep our conversation topics banal and unimportant, usually about games and the latest meme formats from twitter. Every now and then someone will groan about school work and the futility of existence, and we'd murmur in commiseration. But I can never mention about how I still want to kill myself. Or that I still live in inescapable guilt for the shitty things I did to my family years ago. And that I can no longer find it in myself to be happy or motivated for anything related to making a living for myself. I can't say these things anymore. It's not as if my friends are unwelcoming about these sort of topics. Having some form of mental illness is a commonality we all share. I'm not worried about seeming ""less masculine"" in front of them. The very simple truth is that it's immensely taxing for everyone involved. Unless you've dealt with having the police called on you, my circumstance is not easily relatable. And it's annoying to have to assure the worried glances of my friends that ""no, I'm not gonna kill myself now"". I've began to see this as a form of emotional labor that my friends perform for me every time I spill about my persistent suicidal ideation. And I'm just no longer comfortable making them do that anymore."

59796,"I'm not the op of #59716 but come on @ the comments trivializing op's situation. The parents seem to treat him/her (will refer to op as he from now on) well in terms of money but who knows how they treat him physically and emotionally that he has to live apart from them. Would you guys prefer to get abused in exchange for money, @Jaded Jade, @Rizal Rashid?
I'm not saying that $750 is enough or not but I'm focusing on the fact that op said he has been abused for years and you guys only know how to mock and trivialize it. I have been abused by my family too and no, @Jon Taylor, it doesn't mean ""trivial shit"". I know how difficult it is to talk about the abuse without breaking down so I don't expect op to list down the abuse (as you wanted @Owen Tan). Some of the comments are not helpful at all (@Jimmy Chua, @Phoon Li Wern, @Mikhail Lim) and I'm disheartened to see how mean people can be.
@Op, I hope that you are well now that you're away from your family. "

59794,"The usual time of the year where many graduates-to-be are starting to feel anxious after hearing peers securing offers. I was once in your shoes too. 

Although my grades were fairly decent (2:1 in Engineering), I found myself not being employable for most govt jobs due to my 'U' grade for GP. Knowing that the iron bowl is out of the picture, I started bulk applying, attending interviews after interviews. Eventually, after more than 50 applications, I finally got a role which paid $3K/month.

This was slightly below my expectation of $4K, a threshold I thought I should have been getting given what I heard from my peers who got offers from various places. I thought and deliberated for quite a while - whether to continue in my search or to just accept the offer.

Eventually, I decided to take up the offer. I thought to myself to focus on what I have and to make the best out of it, even though there were occasions when I felt shortchanged compared to my batch-mates. Half a year in, I chanced upon an opportunity in another company for >2x the salary I was drawing. A combination of the projects I worked on and a good referral from my previous manager who recognized my efforts landed me the job.

Fast forward a year later, I was drawing >$8K/month. 

I think what I am trying to bring across is 1) earning >$6K within 1 year of graduation is not impossible for non-comp majors, 2) do not be disheartened when you see yourself starting behind your peers, and 3) people do and will recognize your hard work and it will come back to you. 

Sometimes, the best opportunities come to those who wait & persevere. Hang on and fight hard!!

59788,"I have a friend who has severe depression, social phobia and undergoes therapy for it. She was recommended to join foc so she can make more friends and slowly open up to others.

However, I wonder if the interviewers has low EQ or something. They made fun of her condition and rejected her. This almost drove my friend to committing suicide as she kept thinking that she is useless.

To the interviewers, is popularity really that important that you make fun of others who actually have a serious condition and cause them to almost committing suicide? You could have rejected her nicely if you really don’t think that she suits the job.

59782,"I’m disappointed that girls have no qualm hiding/not mentioning that they are not virgin when they clearly know their bf mind about virginity. Whether caring about female virginity is correct or wrong is a separate issue. 

The issue at hand is about hiding and withholding information in a relationship. Nobody can dispute that trust is important in relationship. Deliberate hiding and withholding information is a slow poison to trust. I’m shocked so many people give thumb up to the comment saying the girl shouldn’t tell his bf about her not being a virgin, or shouldn’t tell if he never ask. 

Are you advocating the army mentality of “you can do anything as long as you don’t get caught”? "
59781,"Hi everyone,

I am sorry for the upcoming depressing post, but I do wish to rant as I really do not know what to do. 

I always feel miserable, and I feel that I may not ever be happy. I have loving parents, a loving boyfriend and I could not ask for better friends. Yet, the only time I feel at peace is when I think of leaving this world. I know people say, things will get better. But the thing is, nothing is really wrong. I am not going through any hardships, yet why do I feel this way? I have only really shared what I feel with my boyfriend, and he has been so supportive and reassuring. But I always feel bad for burdening him, and I don't want to hurt him anymore. I try to give myself things to look forward to, but I just feel dread with each passing day. 

Again, I'm sorry for this depressing post. I hope no one else feels this way.  "

59778,"CS2030 has too much workload. On top of the weekly lab assignments that inexperienced java coders like myself take days to complete, we also have an additional individual project (first time this has been implemented) that takes place over the course of the whole semester.  

It is really , really too overwhelming. Sure, some coders are very experienced and can finish this easily. Think about those with no background. We are also trying very hard to grasp everything and, putting in a lot of effort. Don’t discredit us. 

We need time to study for other modules too. I hope the workload can be more spaced out, taking into consideration those who have no background in Java at all. 

Thank you.

59775,"I don't think it's appropriate to state that CS1010 is the only prerequisite for CS2030 - I'm a non CS major who did well in 1010 (I've also done orbital on the Apollo level without a teammate) and I don't understand anything in most CS2030 lectures. I have to google the key terms used in lecture slides and teach myself the content... every. single. time. I totally understand that CS is all about practice and I firmly believe in the strive for continuous learning and improvement but how will I go about practising if I don't know how and why fundamental concepts come about? Some of you may say ""You're a non CS major so deal with it"" but learning should be for everyone - not just child prodigies who started developing software when they were in diapers, and when a module has a certain prerequisite, I expect it to be accurate.

59770,"Hey #59747, I can totally relate to what you're going through. My bf is also a super ambitious guy who talked about his internship all the time. I met him when we were both doing part-time f&b. He was waiting to be enlisted into NS while I was studying at a polytechnic. 

During his army days, things were simple. We both stay in the west so during his BMT, we would take the train from Jurong East to Pasir Ris when he book in and we would spend the long journey talking about his army life. When he book out, I would wait for him at Pasir Ris and we would also spend the journey home talking about his army life. It was super boring listening to him talk about the same army stuff over and over but I really appreciated the fact that he was willing to share his life with me despite being so tired and stressed out by all the army stuff. 

Fast forward to his uni days, I graduated from poly and found a marketing assistant job while he started doing all sorts of internships like summer, winter, part-time internships and even took an LOA to do an internship. Basically, he worked throughout his entire uni life. Throughout the whole course of his uni life, we would meet up after work every day and talk about his school and internship during meals. Again, I listened to him talk about the same school and internship stuff over and over until I can memorise all his classmates and colleagues' names. But I felt happy that I could share his burden by listening to his struggles and difficulties faced at school and work. 

Fast forward to today, he now works at a big firm that pays him 4 times of what I earn. He's constantly busy with work and we could only meet once a week. But whenever we meet up, all he talks about is still work and work. Nevertheless, I'm happy that he still finds time to call me everyday. 

Throughout our relationship, I had my doubts and insecurities. I used to feel very inadequate and worry that he would leave me for someone better. Afterall, I'm just an average poly grad while he's a FCH from a local uni. Whenever I ask him if he would leave me for those smart and pretty girls out there, he would always say that what he's looking for is not a smart and pretty gf but a kind and loving gf. 

So, don't worry that you're not good enough for your partner. Not every guy wants someone as capable as them. Sometimes, what a guy wants is just someone who would support him and be there for him. "

59759,"This has been on my mind, but I wasn’t sure if it was worth a post or rant. Until some complaints about people not receiving text msg till few days later came about. 

Does anyone feels e same way 
It irks me when people dun activate blue tick on their WhatsApp. And it is even worst if you dun bother replying or give super late reply few days later 

I’m totally fine if you read my msg on e same day but reply few days later and I would know cause blue tick will tell me that you have read it 

But when e contacts dun activate e blueticks and dun reply I’m like how do I know if e msg has been send and received. Are u still there or has sth happen 

Which brings me to the next point 
The reason why people dun activate blue ticks is because people in general expect their friend to reply instantly after all we live in e age of instant gratification and how long does it take to reply to a text msg right? 

But we forget get the world doesn’t revolve around us and our friends/ gf/bf/ best friend does not need to reply us instantly if they think e matter can wait. 

I know of friends whose partner read their text on the same day but reply four to 5 days later. 

But thanks to blue tick tech at least e sender has known tt e msg has been read. 

Cause there are people out there who just dun like to use their phone tt much. 

So to confessor #59720. Since ur bf doesn’t reply instantly to his friends too it does shows tt he dun like to reply instantly tt often. But if he still shows up and meeting and spend time with you tt good 

So ask yourself if this really bothers u tt much to e extend of breaking up, what are some compromise tt you guys can come up with. 

Cause I honestly feel it is a trival but important issue and if you guys dun communicate about it how are u guys doing to stay together through other issues and difficulties faced. 

Lack of communication is one of the reason why breakups happen. But what does a evergreen  person in my 20s know."

I rarely follow NUSWhispers unless they pop up on my feed. But recently there has been quite a number of confessions asking for relationship advice about their other half, more often then not begin by stating a few bad points/habits/behaviors of their SO.

The disgusting thing is that the typical replies are always a bunch of trolls asking for breakups, dumping their partner, 'he or she is not worth your time', 'better off without him/her'. Not pointing names because thats besides the point.

I mean cmon, in our parents good ol days era, when relationships break down, they communicate, mediate and fix them. Stop treating your relationship as if you're waiting to hop on the next ship then swings by.

TLDR - Talk to your partners, dont give up on your love ones so easily if you truely love them in the first place.

Have a nice day."

59746,"I come from a broken family and I have attachment issues. My own parents broke up when I was an infant - they also took their frustration at life out on me (and I won't get into the details of that here). 

My relationships have not worked out well since I am unable to trust people or become close to them. People are asking me when I am going to get married since I am in my late 20s now. If I were to get married, that would not only be a disaster for me, but it will also be a disaster for my future spouse, and any future children that I may have - since they will suffer from my lack of emotional availability. Why pressure someone to get married when that person knows it will not be suitable for them?

The longer we've been together, the more I wonder what she saw in me. It makes me really insecure, and affects my self esteem. She seems to have noticed this and she is constantly reassuring her love for me.

Don't be mistaken, I love her a lot, and I'm quite certain she loves me too (she consistently cooks for me, buy me gifts, is fairly clingy etc, which I do reciproate). I definitely want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just need advice on how to manage all these negativity I have."
59731,"Regarding the smart girl saga, I just wanna say no guy likes girls who are smarter than them. Guys like to have face and ego. We like to be dominant and have power. Thus we only like girls who are more vulnerable, weaker and less smart so that we can protect them and exert masculinity. 

It is unfair to criticize guys to have inferiority complex if they don’t like smart girl because it’s hard-wired in male’s brain through thousands of years of evolutionary psychology. 

Yes, we can reason and rationalize it out but that indignant feeling shaped by thousands of years of evo psychology cannot be quenched merely by conscious reasoning and rationalization. Thus, instead of trying to fight back and suppress this feeling, we just choose not to entertain girls smarter than us. 

That’s why guys who feel they are not dominant in a marriage will cheat and find power outside of marriage, a classic case is what happened in Crazy Rich Asian movie. 

In this modern world where gender equality is hailed as the gold standard, the power difference between male and female is getting smaller. Girls.. You can choose to be successful and powerful all you want, just remember to find some guy even better than you. Generally, guys (Asian guys at least) prefer more obedient and submissive girls to be life long partner. 

And this is not about ego, it is about the core of what male and masculinity constitutes. Ask any guy, who like to be henpecked by a girl... Any normal guy will tell you no way! "
59730,"Dear #59730, with regards to your question on how to start a relationship, I have some legit advice for you. 

Step 1: Find someone you like. You can download dating apps, join interest groups or simply stalk people on fb/ig.

*Tip: Avoid people who are obviously out of your league and the delusional/stuck-up ones who think they are too good for everyone*

Step 2: Find something you like about yourself. If you can't even find it then sadly you cannot expect anyone else to like you. 

Step 3: Show off the things you like about yourself e.g. if you like your body, you can wear clothes that accentuate your body. If you like your face, you're most likely a narcissist and you probably shouldn't date anyone. 

Step 4: Befriend the person you like. 

Example:
You saw a random cute girl on fb. You drop her a message e.g. ""Hey, you look pretty, where you from?""
P.S. This only works if you are not ugly.

Step 5: Talk to the person you like on a regular basis. Keep it casual. Mai kanchiong.

Step 6: Ask the person you like if she would like to go out with you. 

First impression counts. 
Put on your best outfit, choose somewhere classy, recce the place beforehand, get her a bouquet of flowers, hold the door for her, etc. 

Expected total damage = $100-200. 

*Tip: the higher the damage, the higher the probability of a second date*

Step 7: Continue to ask the person you like to hang out on a regular basis. This should last a few weeks or months. So get ready to find a part-time job to cover the expenses. 

Step 8: Plan a romantic date for the person you like and ask her to be your gf. 

Expected total damage = your salary for the entire month.  


tl;dr: How to start a relationship? -> Be rich.

59729,"Dear #59684, unlike those people who commented on your post, I'm not here to judge or condemn you. 

You mentioned that you have a gf and got on tinder recently. Have you thought about why you did this? Is it because you were bored or you were trying to find someone new? If you were just bored, you can try to develop new interests and hobbies. If you were looking for a potential partner, you could first evaluate your current relationship i.e. are you happy with your current partner? do you see a future with her? If you're happy and do envision a future with her, I would advise you to stop talking to that new girl before it starts to affect your relationship with your current partner.  

Yes, that new girl may seem very interesting to you. But that could be due to the very fact that you have known her for only 2 weeks. You mentioned that you're not sure if you like her or are infatuated with her. I think it's very easy to 'like' someone, especially if that person is nice and attractive. Based on my own experience, I think infatuations usually don't last. They are merely feelings that fade away as time passes. Afterall, as humans, we are often drawn to new things and then lose interest as the 'newness' wears off.

It's also easy to feel like you've known someone for a long time if you two share a lot of similarities. To be honest, I've met a lot of people whom I felt a great sense of closeness towards because we shared the same thinking and values. Although it certainly felt good to meet such people, it doesn't mean we would be compatible in the long run. 

You also mentioned that you got physical with that new girl but didn't move onto the bed. Are you trying to say you have not cheated? Everyone has a different definition when it comes to cheating. Some people may feel that cheating means seeing two person at the same time. Some may feel that cheating means having sex with someone other than your sexual partner. It doesn't matter what other people think. It doesn't matter what your definition is. Most importantly, you have to ask yourself if you want to continue to stay in your current relationship. 

The length of a relationship may not be the best gauge of the quality of a relationship. But I think 5 years is quite a good amount of time to get to know someone well. Throughout these 5 years, I'm sure there were ups and downs and you should be able to see if you partner would be a good match in the long run. If you don't see her as a good match, you should end things with her as soon as you can. Then you can take your time to get to know the new girl before taking it to the next level. All the best.

My boyfriend is really particular about this as he has told me that he is ""saving his first time"" until after marriage. I do not wish to lie to him, neither do I wish to lose him. Could I have some advice? No trolls please."

59723,"To everyone currently in an abusive relationship, 

I just want to share my personal opinions and experiences on this issue.


I know, easier said than done. I've been there before, and it took me a long time before even realizing and admitting that I was in a toxic, unhealthy and emotionally (sometimes verbally) abusive relationship. Coming to terms with this was probably harder than getting over the actual person because you must accept that you're the victim, that you've been hurt, that the person you loved with your entire heart and whom you gave all you could ever give reciprocated only with apathy, nonchalance and malice - whether intended or not.


I could never meet or talk to any of my other friends that he didn't like (which was almost all of those from the opposite sex). My messages are raided regularly for 'spot-checking', any time past 10 pm if I'm out is considered outrageously late. If I confronted him on returning home at 4 am, I was dismissed as obnoxious and controlling. Not meeting him because I'm really busy with school is being 'unreasonable'. Asking him to quit his bad habits (like fatally bad - smoking) was quickly condemned as 'selfish' and 'intolerant'. Its the famous excuse: ""if you love me, you should accept WHOLLY for who I am"". Intensive interrogation over hours of phone calls was common.


When I told him about my personal troubles, it was met with aloofness or how I was being 'too negative'. He told me to see a psychiatrist instead of transferring my burdens onto him (which I did went to see a counselor instead later on). Not wanting to show affection to him in public meant that 'I did not love him enough'. He was never there for me when I was sick even though I cooked porridge/noodles/herbal teas for him and sponged him with ice water when he came down with fevers. 


One time we were in the middle of a fight while walking and he saw his ex. He abruptly put one hand over my shoulder as we approached her, and only put it down when we were a safe distance away. That's the kind of person he is.


Eventually he got exhausted or bored of the constant arguments we had, the extended cold wars, the thinning conversations. There was nothing else left to make up for the anger, the hurt. Nothing else left to anticipate. He stopped trying. I eventually did the same. 


Till today, a tiny part of me is still deeply convinced that at least at some point, a part of him loved me sincerely. That he saw in me what I had envisioned for us and our relationship. Maybe I'm being delusional. He always told me that he loved me very much and why he did those manipulative and abusive acts were because he was afraid of losing me just like he did with his ex-girlfriends. 


He cooked/bought me food, he sang to me songs, he paid for our outings, he gave me presents and occasional cards, he sent me home almost every time we went out, he was never embarrassed about revealing me to his friends and he always openly proclaimed out relationship to others. To be fair, he did try to cut down on the number of cigarettes he smoke given that he used to be a chain-smoker. He even planned a sweet birthday surprise for me and made me feel very special on particular occasions.


That's most insidious thing about toxic relationships - the good and the bad mixes together, and inconsistent/erratic behaviour from the other party leaves you more confused and desperate rather than hurt. Everyone else around you could see how detrimental this relationship is to you, they ask you to just walk out of it like walking out of a door - but we all know its not that easy.


Whenever you're ready to end it, whenever you're utterly convinced this is really harmful for you, whenever you come to realize how bad the situation is - suddenly the going gets great. He's nice, gentle, and yearning for affection. Either that or you're mercilessly gaslighted and then it's all YOUR fault. A toxic relationship means endless nights of crying your eyes out and  praying the next day you're not going to be breaking any eggshells around him.


You're constantly hoping he's going to change for the better, to fulfill the dreams you all spend hours discussing. I refused to believe that the restrictions he imposed onto me was only to protect his ego and satisfy his egoistical desire to OWN things (especially his girlfriends) completely. I refused to believe that this man I had fallen for would consider hurting me or stop loving me. 


I'm glad it's over now - it felt like I've been purged of something dark and terribly poisonous. My health (physical and mental) has improved ever since the relationship came to an end. I managed to reconnect with some of my old friends. I'm closer with my family, and I focus all the positive energy on improving myself.


Sometimes I forget I'm no longer accountable to him for who I went out with, to which places, till what time, for what reasons. Sometimes I still panic when I forget to delete messages. 


A lot of the posts here ask for relationship advice and from the content of these posts, I see a strong awareness of the massive red flags (and this is also why you worry about them). Only you know best whether your partner has the will to change for the better, for the sake of your happiness and the relationship you share. 


I hate to break it to you but some people are never going to change. Some abusive partners may eventually become enlightened about their behaviours but most of the toxic relationships I've come to know did not yield happy endings. 


Go seek out all the advice possible from your friends. Go visit a counsellor (there are free ones, search harder!) to talk through it. Discuss with your siblings, your family members, your cousins if it helps. Most importantly, speak to your partner- be honest about your feelings (be tactful if you can), and exchange truthful confessions. Give them some time and a chance to prove their willingness to change for the better.


If they don't, leave them. Leave them quickly before your emotional roots sink deeper and don't look back in regret. Its like plucking out a decaying teeth - you don't pluck it out bit by bit do you. You pluck it out in WHOLE. It will hurt initially, but time - the best remedy - will heal the wounds. Even the deep scars will fade into faint etch marks of wisdom.


Don't be afraid of the pain of leaving a (toxic) relationship. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. You deserve to be loved better than this. 

Being out of a romantic relationship is not the end of the world. It's a new beginning in your life. It never has to be lonely.

Love is all around you if you look closely enough - kinship, friendships and most importantly: 

Yourself. "
59722,To the guy who found a black iPod Touch in the USC 3rd floor toilet (between 10am - 12pm) thanks so much for retrieving my item for me. It’ll be great to eventually get it back though. Cheers hahaha 
59721,"Genuine question before I join NUS after NS, but got some troll reply the other time... 

Just wanna know if a macbook on macOS exclusively can last me through Information Security, or would I need a separate Windows machine?

Taking my finances into consideration,  I need the mac for xcode and I don't have the money for large storage to bootcamp or another Windows laptop."
59720,"This has been on my mind, but I wasn’t sure if it was worth a post or rant. Until some complaints about people not receiving text msg till few days later came about. 

Does anyone feels e same way 
It irks me when people dun activate blue tick on their WhatsApp. And it is even worst if you dun bother replying or give super late reply few days later 

I’m totally fine if you read my msg on e same day but reply few days later and I would know cause blue tick will tell me that you have read it 

But when e contacts dun activate e blueticks and dun reply I’m like how do I know if e msg has been send and received. Are u still there or has sth happen 

Which brings me to the next point 
The reason why people dun activate blue ticks is because people in general expect their friend to reply instantly after all we live in e age of instant gratification and how long does it take to reply to a text msg right? 

But we forget get the world doesn’t revolve around us and our friends/ gf/bf/ best friend does not need to reply us instantly if they think e matter can wait. 

I know of friends whose partner read their text on the same day but reply four to 5 days later. 

But thanks to blue tick tech at least e sender has known tt e msg has been read. 

Cause there are people out there who just dun like to use their phone tt much. 

So to confessor #59720. Since ur bf doesn’t reply instantly to his friends too it does shows tt he dun like to reply instantly tt often. But if he still shows up and meeting and spend time with you tt good 

So ask yourself if this really bothers u tt much to e extend of breaking up, what are some compromise tt you guys can come up with. 

Cause I honestly feel it is a trival but important issue and if you guys dun communicate about it how are u guys doing to stay together through other issues and difficulties faced. 

Lack of communication is one of the reason why breakups happen. But what does a evergreen  person in my 20s know."
59719,"This is not a troll post.
Hey #59677 , this is coming from a guy whos going for exchange soon. I also have a girl which I like but I honestly don't think I'll tell her about it before I leave. Chances are that you are probably not the same girl I have in mind, but just let me pretend as if you were her.

I really like you too, to the point that receiving wa messages from you will make my entire day. But I probably won't be confessing to you in person. Cos while I know that we are close, I don't know what you think of me. Am I special to you? Or am I just another one of your close guy friend, like the other one you often hang out with? 

I had a close friend which I liked back in JC as well. But when I confessed to her, things didnt turn out well and I lost her even as a friend. Because of this I am still afraid to confess to you because I'm afraid to lose the status quo. If anything, I dont mind being your friend for a little longer.

I wish we could get even closer, find more excuses to hang out together, so I can know for sure that you are interested in me as I am in you, especially in the upcoming sem break before I leave for SEP. Once I establish that we are mutually interested in each other. I will definitely confess to you. If not, I'll probably keep my feelings to myself.

@#59677, I wish the best to both of us. Hope he'll make his move soon! ;)"
59718,"To the commenters of #59672 regarding the question of whether guys will be intimidated by a girl from the most elite course. As to your question, I would consider myself to be above average looks, getting picked up by strangers for random purpose on the street, having people confessed and having a couple of boyfriends in my life. So I would not say I am unattractive. My concern is that being an elite person in both acads and looks, I genuinely wonder if it will intimidate guys in general because I have been socialising for a bit and wonder if anything serious will come out of it besides people merely praising me or hitting on me. Firstly, I am definitely not arrogant but nature but I am definitely aware of how being in an elite course has subjected me to be shunned by some people who only seem to focus on my identity as that. My friend has brought that issue to my attention which is why I am seeking advice from you all here, not for you all to criticise that I am being arrogant or so. I do not deny I recognise this privilege and I am just concerned what others may think. If I were that arrogant, I would post this non anonymously or ask people in my life directly rather than sieve through anonymous opinions here. I am genuinely asking if guys will be intimated or withdraw in some sense. "
59717,"Hi guys, this is a strange request but I strongly suspect I may have autism.
Does anyone have any recommendations of a clinic / psychologists that that can help me out? I tried emailing UHC but they said they don't provide such services."
59716,"I'm not the op of #59716 but come on @ the comments trivializing op's situation. The parents seem to treat him/her (will refer to op as he from now on) well in terms of money but who knows how they treat him physically and emotionally that he has to live apart from them. Would you guys prefer to get abused in exchange for money, @Jaded Jade, @Rizal Rashid?
I'm not saying that $750 is enough or not but I'm focusing on the fact that op said he has been abused for years and you guys only know how to mock and trivialize it. I have been abused by my family too and no, @Jon Taylor, it doesn't mean ""trivial shit"". I know how difficult it is to talk about the abuse without breaking down so I don't expect op to list down the abuse (as you wanted @Owen Tan). Some of the comments are not helpful at all (@Jimmy Chua, @Phoon Li Wern, @Mikhail Lim) and I'm disheartened to see how mean people can be.
@Op, I hope that you are well now that you're away from your family. "
59715,"I would like to ask how good is the career progression for software engineers/ computing major in sg? I know the starting salary is quite high but does it end up like the civil service sector where pay stagnates? Do they have a glass ceiling in terms of job roles and salary eg.10k, assuming you are not a superstar employee?Thanks!"
59714,"I really do not understand what is all the hate with CS2106. To be fair, I think that most students are ok with how the course is run, and only those who are unhappy tend to be more vocal (look at the comment section at ST or even NUSWhispers to see this in action). This however creates the illusion that everyone is unhappy when only a few are. 

As for me, I find Prof Roland to be a decent lecturer. His explanations are good. While his slides and presentation may be brief, but it does certainly point you to the right direction for self research. He is really nice and approachable in person also. 

P.s. if you cant cope with Prof Roland's teaching, good luck coping with your other 3k and 4k modules. The notes there are even less and you are expected to fill up the gaps more.

59707,"I need some serious advice. I have just been dismissed from NUS. What should I write on my resume to get a job now? Is it even possible? Will companies still hire me?
Also, you all can stop complaining about your CAP and be happy."
59703,"We were very similar, and so we became close. You understood me more than anyone ever did. 
Your parents passed away right as I got to know you, while I was an orphan in an orphanage. You cried to me and I felt your pain. I wanted to put a smile on your face and always be there for you.

I liked you, but I never told you. 
We had another friend who liked you too. Me and him knew that we both liked you and I told him to go for it, because I felt that you liked him more, romantically. I was more of a brother to you. I could not take the step myself to try and ask you out, while he did.

I knew my friend was a very good person, someone you deserved. As for me, I had no home, no personality, no looks. I was a loner, and we only became close because you were the bubbly girl who talked to everyone.

Even though I supported him dating you, every step of the way I felt more and more pain as I saw you guys getting closer while still including me in your meet ups. Many times, I was close to tearing up, seeing how he could bring a smile to your face and just self-loathing myself. You guys got together eventually, while I disappeared away on my own choice.

I signed on and went off the grid from you guys. Deep down, I hoped you would continue to keep in touch with me, but I continuously found excuses to not show up for meetups and you eventually stopped asking.

Then last year, I received an invitation letter from you. It was for your wedding. You got married to him and you're living in bliss now. I'm happy for you guys too. I went to your wedding, stayed a while and left. You texted and asked why I left without telling. I'm sorry I didn't stay longer on your biggest day, but if I did I would have cried and ruined your moment.

It was a first love, and a one-sided love. I made an excuse that I had to disappear from your life because I didn't want to make my friend uneasy being close to you, since he and i knew we both liked you. But the truth is I was cowardly and still am. I still do not know how to move on, but I will, because I love you and he is my friend too.

Stay happy, nj and hj.

59701,"Sometimes I find it sad that there are just some people in your life, that you like as friends, get along well, are nice people, but it is hard to stay friends.

We all get so busy sometimes. And when we are on different roads (different hobbies, major, commitments), we end up not having a reason to meet up or be together. And it happens to hi-bye friends and close friends, eventually..."
