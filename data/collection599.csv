59995,"Is it ok for girls to wear OCS singlets? I'm a guy, so I guess it's normal/acceptable for me to do so. But there's this girl in my hall who wears them around. I don't even know where she got them, like did she steal them from our laundry? If she buys them herself, then why would she buy them? I mean, it'll be quite funny for her to go to emart and buy/pay for them.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they can't wear these singlets. I'm only asking this because I'm afraid she might be a pervert who steals guys' clothes. I know no straight girl would want to wear them, so perhaps she's gay? I mean, it only looks nice on guys, not on girls. I know some of you may say I'm thinking too much, but with so many despo and weird girls on campus, it's better for us to take precautions.

59981,"We were once a tight group of friends, of which include someone who i would fall in love with; and him for me. A series of misunderstanding happened and he distanced himself from us all, and the furthest from me. He never told us what happened, but it seemed the misunderstanding caused him to hate me.

Years and years have passed and yet our ties remained cut.

Tomorrow I’ve been tasked to present him with the news that one member of our clique passed on.  

I thought I had moved on but on knowing I have to see him again, the carefree days of our lives flew back to my mind. It was like watching a broken record and yet never being able to enter its screen. 

It was a second chance to see him again and yet possibly also the last chance. Which hurts more than never seeing him again.

59980,"Just heard about cs2040 being a disaster (again), and I'm honestly not shocked at all. It was pretty much the worst module I have taken in SoC. What's most amusing is that we'll have profs who are well aware of the problems with it and how poor a metric the 2040 grades are, and still continue to ask for your final 2040 grade for every single 'special' class and programme.

To everyone taking it in Sem 1 even though it is delaying practically every other module, congratulations on dodging a bullet. Better late than lousy. "
59979,"I’m a science student who took CS1010S and got a B+, got rejected by CS dept for compsci minor but went ahead to take the CS2030 past equivalent (CS1020) and got an A-. I really don’t think the difference in language matters that much...we were taught OOP at the last part of CS1010S anyway it’s just getting around the idea that EVERYTHING is OOP and learning the difference in syntax. The basic logical thinking is still the same.In fact I think the workload for CS1020 was so much better than CS1010S lulz the weekly missions were death. But anyway after that they approved my application for a minor and since then my cap died in the hands of CS. So ya if you think CS2030 is too much please rethink your choice if you really want to go down this path. (Maybe i did well in CS1020 because I had a great prof and TA. Shout out to prof Sunteck and Ivan! So sad I never got a chance to take a mod under them again)"

The reason I'm asking because I was quite fit all my life until the injury. I can't even remember how I started my fitness journey and I've never been trained professionally in that regard.

1,3,5 noons or evenings - Hit Chest, Squats and Back respectively with light weights and end with variations of core workouts.

59977,"To #59876 on fwb

Let’s end the fwb issue once and for all!!! Girls can do whatever they want and sleep with whoever they want!!

But if they get unwanted pregnancy, abortion, emotional manipulation, used by men etc, they deserve absolutely NO sympathy AT ALL since they bring everything upon themselves and they are fully aware of the risk they are putting themselves in. 

No need to be white knight because nobody will appreciate you. The girls will just smear you into a busybody bigot patriarch controlling their sexuality. As the Chinese saying goes 不见棺材不掉泪，let them learn it the hard way (no pun intended)!! "
59974,"I am the #59974 author. 

Thank you all very much for your views. I hope I did not come across as salty - maybe I am just FOMO. I was just hoping for some good comments. It is great that there are people who are receiving help - and also sad that there are many left behind. 

Perhaps the reason why we see so many help groups which accentuate gender and racial lines is because the discrimination and harassment has created a common 'experience' which they all can learn to overcome together.  But I am also of the opinion that everyone (from other demographics) should be open and learn about these because it does take two or more hands to clap assuming minds are open. 

In the end, I feel in any power dynamic situation as long as one demographic has majority control there is probably going to be some form of inherent discrimination (which is pretty much clear in many places regardless of which gender or race is on top of that power dynamic). How do we - as a diverse hodge podge of gender race religion socioeconomic classes  - prevent the propagation of this phenomenon?

59970,"I'm the author of #59970. I was just asking for an opinion because I was genuinely afraid he might be a pervert or something. Honestly, I was shocked by the comments, some of which were quite mean (it's funny that the mean comments were from guys lol). Ok, I did not know that FBT was army attire. But that was 20 years ago. Today, they're considered women's clothing so he shouldn't have worn it in public, since it may give the wrong ideas. There's a reason why normal guys don't wear FBT in public (I'm talking about the curve cut kind). Anyway, I've told my girl friends to just be cautious about their clothes and to keep an eye on him. It's better to be safe than sorry. I think guys in particular shouldn't comment so much, since y'all will never experience being stalked or having your clothes stolen by a pervert."

We agreed to meet up last year, but we still didn't till today. What disappoints me is that she agrees on the meet-up, but it will never materialize. I feel that she is stringing me along.

However, my best friend wanted to stay on as she did not have enough fun yet. She wanted me to accompany her for the rest of the trip but I didn't want to as I was worried that I might miss the last train home. In the end, she reluctantly left the place together with me as she claimed that it would be pointless for her to enjoy the trip on her own (note: I did not ask her to leave with me, she is free to stay on). The thing is, she did not have to worry about missing the bus or train as the place was very near her home. Unlike her, I live very far from that place. Since then, she did not talk to me or text me for weeks despite me apologizing to her over text that I had to leave earlier. What makes me sad is that even though her friends left earlier than me, she wasn't angry with them. She even thanked them nicely for their accompany in our group chat  and I was not mentioned in the message. I feel very sad as I really regarded her as my best friend. I didn't mean to ruin her fun.

59956,"Hello. I am the original author of #59956 - the one regarding splitting finances for wedding. Thank you for all the comments, i am flattered. 

Fun fact - my husband is younger than me by quite a bit (he is not xiao bai lian, dont worry). But that aside, I just want to say such mentality is not rare amongst girls, but rather it needs to be communicated with understanding. Some female dont think that way because the guy partner is already earning enough to pay half or even more. I am just fortunate enough to be able to meet someone from totally different background and put me through this test of going against the society norms. 

Is like if a person earns 10k per month and can afford to buy a Prada bag from the disposable income, why must they settle for a coach bag instead? If the guy partner is earning more or the same, some ladies would naturally feel that it is only right to do 50:50 or guys pay more. I admit i used to think that way when i was with my ex who earns 2k more than me per month. I seriously considered about the monetary part before i even agreed being his girlfriend cause i thought our future would be so difficult..

But because im able to meet my current husband that allows me to gain a total different perspective about being in a relationship and being in love. I know some girls would probably not bother to start a relationship with a guy of such background but i chose to go ahead because I was really in love with him and felt like a little princess being his girlfriend (not with the monetary gifts, but mainly the way we show our love and affection towards each other). Most importantly, our mentality are of the same frequency. Im not afraid to be myself when im with him or hang out with his friends, vice versa. Im happy that im able to see this guy for life..

But the truth is, even for guys or even girls who earn well, it doesnt mean they know how to save up for their future. Some may not even save a single cent only to struggle when they want to settle down. Some proritise expensive hobbies over their future. But mostly just dont communicate and may end up in ""since u guy then u pay more la"" kind of situation cause the girl didnt have that savings ready. The girl at times just expect the guy to be like a magician and show the money. But isnt wedding between two parties who really want to spend the lifetime together? Then all those financial burden should be shared and not one to have more or less (up to each couple's agreement). I know some guys who are really egoistic and say it doesnt make sense for girls to pay so he never wants to settle down when he dont have the money yet. Same - some girls say that they are the one leaving their roof to be with the guy so naturally the guy should pay for wedding.

I dont know what im trying to say and its difficult for me to explain how did the relationship between me and husband could have so much mutual understanding. I guess it's mainly: 

1) we prioritise our love and future over anything else. 

2) we communicate truthfully without hiding how we really feel. 

3) we listen to understand and not to reply. 

4) we plan our life financially as well (ps. We dont go for a lot of dates. Ie. We are not those ""my weekend is automatically with my partner"" kind of couple. We just meet for meals - those we are really hungry and want to eat and not eat for the sake of meeting kind. We just go for some free events to enjoy our time. And definitely, we spend money when necessary!)

5) dont ever feel envy about other people relationship. I have girlfriends who would call of meet up to compare engagement rings. I would give that a miss cause i dont think its worth comparing. Please dont ever take k drama as the norm. 

6) be contented that you found the one. Can you imagine yourself needing to leave him cause of money? If you cant, let go of such money quarrels and go with your feels. "

59938,"Reply to Confession #58979

If you and your partner are roughly of the same age and earning the same income. I feel that it is a much better decision to make it fair 50:50 rather than getting the Male to pay more just because of social hierarchy. This is because your relationship will be a long term one and starting 'unfair' might become a source of conflict in the future which is something that you definitely want to avoid. But to be fair, I do not know of your situation and I do acknowledge some of the situation that might be alright to split 70:30 or 60:40.

1. Ask yourself this question, what are you going to use the rest of the money for when your partner pay more for the 'bigger items'? If it's personal items, assuming that male and female has the same basic necessities, aren't you just being unfair to him?
If you're using it under circumstances such as dental treatment, funding your little brother's school, etc (case on case basis) then you might want to talk to your partner to a certain agreement, but do be honest and remember that not all reason are actually 'valid'. Example is if you say you are funding your parents vacation, he also have parents and the arrangement will become unfair to his parents. So... the point is, really think through what are you going to use the rest of the money for before bringing this up to an 'unbalanced' arrangement.

2. What's the dynamic of your 'smaller items' payment? If it's all based on 50:50, I don't see why you should push the bigger items to other ratio. But if you have the tendency to pay for smaller items, let's say you cover electricity bill, dinner  etc. Then maybe it's actually alright because in the end it will be approximately 50:50 for what is covered by both of you~ 

3. If the guy is really okay with any arrangement, who am I to say? What I want to say though, a lot of couples went through this phase when the guys would not mind paying more for the girls and again, consider what will happen in the future. Based on your dynamics, can it be the reason for a crack in your future relationship?

Do take note that they're my opinion and I might miss some other possible cases. In the end, it really depends on you and your partner. I wish you all the best in your relationship~"
59937,"I dont believe in whistleblowing but the bus driver for bus D1 with license plate PC4038K is just too much. The incident happened on 11 March, 2pm. The driver hurled hokkien vulgarities at students for not moving into the bus and blocking boarding students. Being angsty, he then went on jam braking the bus and open the door for like a second for passengers to unload at the next stop. Obviously there are students who did not managed to get down so they shouted for the driver to stop. The driver then stopped, opened the for for another 1 second, closed the door and drive. There were again students who have yet to go down. So the shouting ensued and the door opened again. This is absolutely ridiculous. I hope authorities can look into this matter. Thank you."
