58695,"Dear K,

Sorry I wasn’t good enough for you. Sorry that you have to look to other guys to entertain you. Sorry that being in the same course and seeing each other 8 hours a day wasn’t good enough for you.

Honestly I know you have been lying to me all these while. Every time you told me you were home or giving tuition, I know you were with another guy. You can travel from the East to NTU to watch a guy play basketball but you can’t find me for a meal. 

I’m tired of living in fear of losing you. Glad I’m finally done with you :)"
58694,"My bf is extremely sensitive to criticism and a very egoistic person. I thought as long as he treats me well in general, I can give in to that side of him. However, recently he is getting from bad to worst. I have no idea how to communicate with him and not stepping on his toes. Please give me some advice"
58693,"My thoughts drift back to you. It's tracing itself to years ago, the first chocolate I received from you, the first conversation we had, the first message you sent me, the first time I thought I felt something when you told me about your relationship problems. I repressed it. I don't deserve to be loved by anyone, much less you. 

I miss you very much. I miss the conversations we would have, the late night typing away on the phone for hours, just lying in bed and constantly trying to out-wit each other with the funniest replies or delving into the deep stuff of life. 

Things felt so comfortable with you. I could say anything and it wouldn't matter what it was, you always knew what I meant. I love it when we both type the same thing at the same time because it just clicks. 

We could stop talking for long, long months and every time we reconnect it feels exactly the same. We continue from where we left off and it seems as though the dynamic has never shifted. 

I didn't have the guts to leave my partner. You didn't ask anything more from me, always silently understood and backed away when you felt that you were coming to chartered territories you shouldn't intrude. But you already did, and I kept trying to say ""we are just friends, I'm just doing this cause we're friends"" but I was in denial. I didn't want us to be just friends. 

I didn't dare to ask for more because I know you wouldn't fall for me. I know, deep down you would never like someone like me no matter how well we hit it off. We are just friends. 

We just weren't meant to be a pair because in so many ways, we are universes apart and I don't see the gulf that separates but I know it exists. You love crowded places, new adventures, thrilling nights and cold beers and I can't handle noise or people, preferring to spend solitary evenings with a book. You're loyal, outgoing and so optimistic it's blinding. I'm bordering on suicidal nihilism.

Sometimes I see you around in school but I actively avoid you because I'm just too scared to talk to you again. I don't want you to feel like I'm using you. I feel ashamed. And guilty. I don't know how long I will feel this way. I wish you would just talk to me again, but you never start conversations with me since years ago and I think that is an indication of how you feel about me. 

I wish we could reconnect. I wish i could tell you how I felt about you just so you know - just so I could finally let you go from my heart and bury what would never happen between us. I wish i could spell out my true feelings - for myself. To at least be accountable to myself. 

Typing this is actually giving me a stomachache in the middle of the night. 

I wish you nothing but the best in life, because you deserve nothing less. 

Thank you for reading this. "

My bf and I have been together for 2 years now, however, my bf has been comparing me and his other friends girlfriends.

Recently, he saw on his Instagram story that one of his friend's girlfriend bought him a gucci wallet for valentines day and he showed it to me and said ""u see, other ppl gf buy gucci leh, u leh?"" don't get me wrong, I did bought him something, which was a pair of Nike slides he wanted. But he knows that I don't come from a wealthy family. 

I didn't know how to react at the moment but now I think of it, I'm not sure if he was picking on me or he was just joking.

If he was picking on me, any advice for me??

I should have known better and cut my losses at that point and pulled out immediately. But I didn't and she kept making more and more demands, even after I had booked the accommodation.

Sometimes I even had to drive him home like at 3am,after he is done partying because it's expensive for him to cab home. Additionally, I have to send his other friends home too. I was thinking if this is too much? Maybe once in a while is fine. But almost every Saturday night they have to party? They already spend Mondays to Fridays together.

58635,"To #58550

I went for an abortion too when I was still in university days. I did not regret my decision because I cannot give the best for my child. I did not tell my parents or family about it because they will definitely make me bear the child. Just before the abortion, I suffered from some side effect from the medicine the doctor gave and I was vomitting non stop and shivering in cold (when it's like 30 degree outside the clinic). After the abortion, you'll definitely feel guilty, you'll probably be unable to sleep well for a few weeks. But I didn't regret my decision at all. Don't think about what others say, think about what you really want. Do you really want the baby? Don't let those guys that commented on your post to guilt trip you, they are males, they don't have to handle the stress of having a kid. Btw the procedure cost me around $3k."

As you work on yourself and you progress in your career and your lifestyle, you become more attractive even as you get older. 

The urge to settle down also starts to weaken as the sex drive weakens. 

So your dating pool widens while your desperation decreases. 

Don’t settle for any ex party girls. There is only entitlement, irresponsibility, immorality, STDs and a loose vagina to be had there. 

It is always better to be single than to be yoked with such a woman. "

58620,"Response to #58620

I find it amazing how many of the comments talk about outsourcing to maid. 

Cooking and cleaning are basic life skills for everyone. 

More importantly, there seems to be a mindset of entitlement by some of the commenters that things would be done for them because they don't like or want to do it. 

No one should expect their spouse to carry the entire workload, whether it is household chores, childcare etc. "
58618,"Hey #58550

I've had an abortion few months ago too. It was a terrible ordeal for me. I'm really thankful my boyfriend was supportive and we're still very stable together. You should discuss with your boyfriend whether to keep the child or not. Personally for me, keeping it was never really an option. My boyfriend and I had lengthy conversations and had already decided to abort it before we even know of the pregnancy. I went for the procedure without my family and friends' knowledge because:

1. Their opinions won't change my mind. 
2. I didn't want them to worry about me dying or getting complications. Old people worry about many things. 

But in case you're worried and stressing out, here's a few tips. 

1. It's almost trauma free. I was 11/12 weeks into the pregnancy, I have irregular period so I didn't realise earlier. Plus I didn't suffer from those pregnancy symptoms so it was really hard to detect. Anyway I had a surgical abortion and throughout the procedure I was sedated. Slept for 1.5 hours thereabout. When I woke up I had no remembrance of what happened other than the fact that I was scared shitless and cried like mad few minutes before the sedation set in. I bled like normal period for 12 days after the procedure.

2. Finish the antibiotics your doctor prescribe you. Infections can be troublesome since your cervix is ""open"" and more sensitive after the procedure. And no sex for 2 weeks please control yourself.

3. There is very little risk unless you're in your late second / third trimester. It will not affect your future childbirth ability / lead to any problems with your future offspring. Of course, finding a legitimate doctor is important. Please don't visit the underground doctors for cheaper fees. It's not worth the risk. Research on your doctor before confirming the procedure. I got my doctor through a clinic recommendation. 

4. The procedure + review check up costed $3k-4k. I was asked to pay in cash, so do check with your clinic if you need to prepare enough cash for the procedure. 

Good luck and safe sex please. "

58616,"It seems like the both of us finally know what is going on. I think I was the one slower on the uptake. Maybe this is why you seem so tense with me now. I would never do anything to jeopardise what's important to us both, and I would tell you that if I could. The hard part is not being able to talk about it with you.

58610,"To #58566, 

I have the same problem. It's easier for me to build positive relationships with cats than with humans. It's especially difficult in school. People who are better than me don't want to befriend with ""trash"" like me. People who are worse than me also stay away from me. People of my similar standard can be too competitive and jealousy to be my real friends. 

""I can tell that they are bored with me and uninterested in me. I know that people would rather talk to someone else than me.""

Yes, this applies to me too. Even when I make the initiative to strike up a conversation, they just respond passively to die down the talk. 

I realize that I'm just an outsider, a marginalized person. I'm not an insider cool kid. 

I can only accept it and just do my own thing.

58607,"Noticed a trend about posts like #58607. What's up with year 2 biomedical engineering this year? It's not like the batch has many good looking and attractive guys even, one or two here and there but they're usually attached.

Are all these OPs and like people who talk about the bioeng guy all talking about the same person???

58606,"A bit late to rant about this, but-- I disagree with a lot of the conversation around Valentines' Day and romantic special occasions, especially from the male OPs. 

I have never celebrated v day on v day itself, but I believe strongly in having special occasions in a relationship. No, I dont want expensive flowers, and no I dont ""only want guys to show their love on one day"". It goes without say that you should show love to your partner every day-- but that is a lowkey (albeit crucial) kind of everyday love, e.g. quality conversation, physical intimacy, shared hobbies.

Special occasions are, to me, for relationship highlights like handmade gifts and very nice dinners. I dont want those every day. Firstly, bc of cost and time issues, like seriously, can you make a gift every day? Secondly, i wouldnt want like champagne and oysters every day, because it would quickly become boring and our new ""normal"". I find that matters like good conversation should happen daily, but other things like expensive food taste extra good if enjoyed in moderation.

And if you personally dont like special occasions and your partner agrees, that's totally fine. But you dont get to put down others by deciding they must be dumb or materialistic. And it is eyerolling to pull the edgy gotcha of ""oh so you dont want to be loved every day??"" "
58605,"Everytime I see someone posted their needs for job seek, I almost always want to volunteer myself as interview partner or to review their resume. Does anyone feel the same way or it is just me?"
58603,"#58556 Why stressed about things that you can't control, and will only look to address it a few years later? Just solve one thing at a time and see how things develop in the future. 

Your situation doesn't sound that dire actually. More of self stress. Forget about passion and find a job that pays well or have a structured career progression, and your situation will improve greatly. "
58602,"Hey, I’ve been reading up a lot of posts lately and have two things I would like to address. 

I’ve been a seasoned party girl, yes, I work hard and play hard. Living the temporary high life through music and drinks. Of course, I dance with friends and new friends alike, as long as they can dance with the groove. That’s about it. I get all the fun through good music, there are times it gets troublesome to block advances, but I drew the line. This is my party life and why do most think party girls are wild and definitely have fwbs and ons? Well, don’t be so narrow minded ????. 

Secondly, while Valentine’s Day is all about commercialism. Why don’t people take it as a chance to express love which one could possibly have taken other days for granted? It really depends whether your partner appreciate such opportunity. If nothing is said explicitly, then will gifting something on that very day (may not even be tangible or be of high value) hurt you? Are you afraid of being held in comparisons with other couple or are you afraid of showing your love to your partner? There’s a difference thinking practical and being thoughtful because imagine your other half have to look at her peers getting gifts and and answer why they have none? And of course, surely, if she loves you, she will justify for you."
