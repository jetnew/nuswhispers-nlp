57399,How do you decide when to get into a relationship and who to get into a relationship with? I do have single friends that I find are quite physically attractive that I enjoy spending time with. But I also don't really feel anything resembling a crush at all. I don't think I'm asexual at least.
57398,"To #57385 (quoting from various redditors) The outrage is due to the fact that a lot of the deaths are from normal everyday people acting soldiers, not a career soldier. A career soldier chose his life, chose to enter service, accepted the risks involved and are more invested in training in his career. 

But as NSmen, they are FORCED into the service against their will under threat of imprisonment. Unwilling part time soldiers are not the same as a highly trained career soldier.

Career soldiers get adequately compensated for their services. Sure, it's dangerous, but they're also earning risk pay and all the associated benefits of being a civil servant.

NSmen on the other hand just gets shafted hard from all directions. Do most work, most risk involved, least compensated, and above all, doing it not by choice, but because our nation needs us.

If a someone compels you and place you in a dangerous environment they should do their utmost to minimise risk, it's about responsibility.
There's a huge difference between me getting hit by a car on the way to work or an employer asking workers to climb onto unsteady scaffolding or mandatory military service. You cannot take every risk out of everything but death should be unacceptable, there shouldn't be a number of deaths where it is deemed reasonable."

57396,"#57356:

I rent an apartment near the school and have this female roommate.

She changes her clothes in my presence even when I am in the same room as her.

I am a guy, and I feel embarrassed changing in front of other. I wonder how does she change her clothes without feeling embarrassed.

That isn't all. She often lifts up her shirt and tells me to scratch her itchy back for her.

I thought she was the worst until I read your post.

57391,"Why are some people just crazy inconsiderate?!
Okay, this may get very disgusting but I think this needs to get out there. I stay in RC, and there have been multiple cases where some person just doesn't have the intellectual capability of flushing their own feces! It is just beyond me that someone cannot do such a simple thing as flushing the toilet. A shared toilet is a public space, okay? This is just outrageous to get into a cubicle only to find a load of splattered discharge and dirty tissues inside the toilet bowl. (Just to be clear,) it doesn't need more than a glance to know what's inside the toilet bowl, I wasn't staring to identify those things.
To the irresponsible person(s) out there, do you know who you are being the most unfair to? The cleaners. You are being extremely inconsiderate to them for making them take care of your waste. I mean, you are a university student, you should have at least some common sense to flush. Just because they are paid to clean it doesn't mean that you should make their job miserable. Please be more considerate to people around you."
57388,"Just attended a class today where some student was making fun of the lecturer's accent. (I'm not going to identify anyone here.) And they did it publicly by posting on an online Q&A page, which the lecturer reads out in class. Felt alarmed and sorry to see this :( and I even heard people giggling around me as the comments came up on the screen. I mean come on... we're just here to learn, can't people keep these things to themselves instead of being hurtful?"
57387,"i heard from one of my friends in another faculty that their lab coats were thrown away by the one of the school staff members because they left their lab coats on the chair. previously the staff warned them that if they left it on the chair, the lab coats would be sent for laundry services. it's been about 4 months since the incident and my friend says that they haven't received their labcoats (which were supposedly sent for laundry). when they asked the staff, the staff member said that the lab coats cannot be retrieved back anymore and could have been lost or thrown away. this happened to around 10 students and each lab coat is not cheap. i feel a little unjust for my friend. while there are lab safety rules that have to be obeyed in this school, it's quite unfair how they were told that the lab coats were 'lost' and 'could be thrown away', even though the staff member said that it would be sent for laundry services hence they were still expecting to receive their lab coats. just wondering does NUS have a policy about confiscation of items, or is this a case of misuse of power? normally if an item is confiscated, would it be returned or would it be thrown away without permission of the student?

57378,"So I'm not sure if this has already been noted by other users of NUS_STU, but if it hasn't, I think credit should be given where credit's due: was anyone else prompted to change their password directly from their MacBook/laptop when they connected to NUS_STU and their password was expired?

Previously, I remember I had to go through this awfully undirected experience where I had to google for the right place to reset my password, get some sort of 2FA verification done, etc., and all this was done without being notified that my password had expired.

But today was the day that my password expired and supposedly, I had to change it on my own. But instead, when I opened my MacBook and tried to connect to NUS_STU WiFi, a pop-up appeared on my MacBook prompting me to change my password directly from my device. I love this – it's so efficient. I'm pretty sure I hadn't experienced this before and I think it's great."

57369,"To OP of #57338:

Please do not invalidate someone else's feelings just because you or someone you know is suffering from (what you feel is) something worse. Everyone is different. We have different ways of coping with problems we face and how many set backs we can deal with before we really really give up.

Of course, being residents of a first world country, on average, we are definitely more privileged than those living in circumstances worse than us. 

But self-harm is not something u can ""Grow up"" from. I don't think anyone who have attempted self-harm before and overcame it ever thought, ""I'm wiser and older now, I will no longer commit suicide like my younger foolish self would"". 

""I'm sure you are smart enough to understand that you have a choice."" 
What do you mean smart enough to understand that you have a choice? Please tell me what being smart has to do with anything mental health related? Have you actually met someone suicidal who decided ""No, I'm not going to kill myself because I'm smart and I know that suicide is choice."" ?? There are so many people who are struggling from different kinds of mental health illnesses that don't stem from so many problems that pile up in their lives. 

After reading your post I came to the conclusion that you do not value mental health as much as it should be valued. Perhaps you are not aware of the sigmatisation of people with mental illnesses in Singapore (and maybe in other countries too, but idk). So before you go around telling people to suck it up and appreciate life because it is worth living, why don't you actually read and understand the feelings of the OPs of the posts you've bashed?

To everyone reading this, when someone dear to you say things like ""I've only slept 3 hours today"" or ""I've skipped 2 meals today"", please refrain from one-upping them by saying ""I've slept less than you and I'm not complaining"". Do not cause your relationship to become a toxic one where the both of you can't share your troubles because it can never be worse than the other person's.

Why?
Because luminus has definitely illuminated how white their pages are when they don't load/work! 

Oh wait, even the colour of the pages are depressing. 

I guess the new excuse for not paying attention or not submitting assignments shall be: I can't download any of the material for class because luminus isn't working. 

Here are some solutions if you wanted constructive criticism: 

1. At least duplicate the module information onto IVLE so students don't get triggered that luminus is the only platform that they can find their module information at (I still don't understand why some modules chose to fully transition into luminus when IVLE is at least  *a little* more stable; or at least I can load my pages????)
2. Fix the website before putting it online? 
3. Be more efficient with your updates?? 

""We are looking to implement an effective and robust fix in the coming weeks."" 

You do realise that some of us actually have to submit assignments, look at webcasts, or even download lecture materials in the ""coming weeks"" right? If you only fix the website mid-semester, how on earth are we supposed to study for our modules?
