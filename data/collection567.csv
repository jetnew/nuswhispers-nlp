56797,"Hello, I am interested to take Japanese 1 next sem, and I am a year 1. May I know when can we start bidding for it? Will it be available in round 1 or only 2A? (Or 2B?)

Do we have to do anything additional to get the mod, or just bidding will be fine? Thanks!"
56796,"Is CORS lagging for anyone else?

I don't understand how it can lag so much this time to the point that you can't even get to the login page. This is stupid. "

56787,"Recently my friends have taken this crazy interest in guys' sexual performance and they mentioned that guys that are good in bed most probably have a longer sexual history than most people's shopping list. I'm inclined to agree; most sexual partners I've had that have lower numbers of sexual partners aren't as good as their peers that have been around the block...

56782,"Dear prof ben leong, i have been thinking of this for very long. But after i saw your reply on NUSWhispers, i dont know if this is possible. You mentioned in a reply that someone managed to change course to CS in y4s1 and managed to graduate in time with FCH. 
I wonder if it is possible to change course in y4s2 and graduate in time with FCH?

#Troll #Funny"
56780,Shout out to Prof Ben Leong.  I think your dedication to your students (and NUS students in general) speaks for itself.
56778,What do people think of the latest TODAY article about our fixation on KPIs? In my second year at one of the affected faculties and really frustrated and worried by this expose. Can seniors and graduates speak up?
56775,"I am year 1 BBA student, recently i realised that im kinda interested in this guy who is the same group as me for es2002. Initially we had some disagreements however towards the end i found myself attracted to the cute guy in the group. Although he is slightly shorter than i am, i hope that he wouldnt mind :) at this point i am not sure whether i should express how to him how i really feel. Please advise me on this :("
56774,"My current CAP is now 3.89... Tried using the cap calculator on digital senior and it says that I need at least a 4.82 for next sem in order to move up to a 4...

But to be honest, is it possible? I only have 3 more mods to take and I also hope to find a part-time job (so that I can work while studying). Should I aim for a 4 or should I just hover in second-lower? 

I'm in FASS btw. "

56759,"Hi, I heard that many people are vying for a spot for a summer program in Korea. Any tips on how to maximise the chance of being accepted? Do I stand a chance if my CAP is 4?"
56758,"Hello, I am a FASS student interested in attending a summer program in Korea. How many modules do most exchange students take there? Are 3 modules too many if I am just a mediocre student? Also, any general piece of advice to give with regards to summer programs? Thank you for taking the time to reply!"
56757,Any idea how to use the new EduRec to check which tutors are teaching which time slots? I used to be able to do so using myISIS through the Student Centre but EduRec doesn't seem to have that option available. Unless there is another portal that can do so.
56756,"Any advice on how to handle this girl leaving flirty comments on my boyfriend's instagram posts? I'm not surprised if girls do find him attractive (because he really is and I'm very lucky to have him as my boyfriend) but I'm just bothered by the comments. Especially when he replied them in a lighthearted manner but sort of leading them on? ((if you get what I mean))

We're 6 months into the relationship, and we don't really post couple photos on instagram (though he did mentioned me in his instagram stories sometimes whenever we're out). I trust him that he won't hurt my feelings, but I just don't want to act all petty and jealous to ask him to tell the girl off he's already in a relationship right? :(

Any advice appreciated thanks."
56752,Anyone knows if it is possible to take CS1010S as a biz student? I can only apply for CS1010 and CS1010E but those are taught in C and not as relevant :(
56751,"Hello everyone, so I am a year 4 CS student that is currently job hunting. Can anyone advise on what I should be looking out for in a job? What is the salary I can expect? I did see a value in the average in the Graduate Employment Survey 2017, is it safe to expect/request that amount or is it skewed, hence too low or high? Also, are there any other things I should look out for? I do not know any seniors at all, so I will be grateful for some advice! Thanks!"

56745,"I’ve never liked Prof BL bc I think his views on women are backward, but seriously, even I have to defend him here. People are getting more and more entitled. He is taking time out of his day to give advice to you (and don’t say it’s his responsibility to help you just because he is a professor - you are just some random FB poster and did not even approach him personally. Also, no professor is obliged to help us in any way, they are doing us favours with every consultation).

Why must people spend time to research stuff for you and still cite the source etc. etc. Like seriously? We are already in university - can we please start (1) being grateful when we receive help instead of complaining that the help is not good enough, and (2) making the effort to google shit instead of confessing our life story here?

I can’t believe I actually had to defend him ok the poster went so far that I got indignant on Prof BL’s behalf. TLDR; no one owes you anything."
56744,"I'm currently in need of opinions. Please no trolls because it has been bothering me for days.

I'm currently at a 3.4 CAP, year 3 student and I used to want to proceed to Hons.. but now I suddenly think it's not worth it if I graduate with such bad CAP for Hons. I've been doing average for my course the whole time and my grades are almost all Bs, 1A and 3 C-Ds. It's pretty stable, and no matter what effort I do for my core, I can't score above a B. 

I've been applying for jobs in private sectors only last week and yet to get replies but I'm worried that I am not able to get a job even after I end sem 2 because I have no Hons.

People around me have advised me to continue on but I see no point. My mother has kept on insisting that 4 years is better than 3 years. 

Initially, even before I entered uni, I knew I wanted to only do 3 years because of family issues at home and I can't stand it. It affects me mentally and emotionally. I've stopped going to counselling as my counsellor had agreed that I'm relatively more stable enough to handle myself and I've improved a lot. I wanted to get a job as soon as possible but now, it seems like people around me and my mother kept insisting I should do honours. I don't want to graduate and not have a job immediately, and hear people around me say ""I told you so."" I don't want that kind of regret but at the same time, I don't want to regret not graduating in year 3 once I reach year 4 due to personal issues at home which I rather not discuss.

Please advice. Sighs ):"

56735,"Hello! I'm a biz year 1 undergraduate, and I worked really hard in the first sem but only got a CAP of 3.80 (without s/u)... is this considered bad in biz school? I know a lot of friends who got CAP 4.5 and above )-:"

I can't remember if I appeal for it, but I managed to map Finance, Financial Markets, and another finance module for SEP at UK. I was an accountancy undergraduate, so I was only allowed to map non accounting modules for exchange (which could be why NUS allowed me to do it concurrently). 

If you were in a similar situation as me, you can try too. You may also want to email the professors for your pre-req & post req modules, to get the relevant materials in advance. Pre-req modules can be simple and Cap does not include exchange modules, but it is important to get your basics firm.

56721,"Have any guys noticed how frivolous girls are on tinder? They match with you, sometimes even super like you but either never initiate a conversation or leave it hanging in between! It’s almost as if most of them have no notion of respect for the other person and that maybe his feelings would be hurt now that you enjoy got his hopes high and then dumped him mid conversation. Instead it seems like they keep on collecting tinder and Instagram likes to inflate their own self worth and show it off to their friends all the whole treating guys with contempt.

56716,"I am dating a guy who is already working now, and we always AA for our meals and I am totally OK with it. But there is one incident that makes me wonder whether I should continue the relationship with him. He asked me to go to his house, and I plan to take mrt first. But he ask me to grab to his house and he said he would pay for it. After I get the grab, he asked me how much it is. After I told him its 9 dollar, he said :"" it is so cheap, and I will pay HALF for it."" I was so shocked because he said he will pay for it in full just now. I never expect he is so calculative.  Should I continue with him?"
56714,"Reading about the people having CAP 5 or near CAP 5, while overloading to insane levels, is truly inspiring- or demoralizing. No doubt they deserve every grade and accolade that they got. 

Makes me question though - Why am I not smart enough? Why am I not as good? Why can't I measure up? Will I ever be as successful as they are? Why is my life not as good as theirs? Just another graduate- an average graduate who would probably never amount to anything like these people. What makes such a life worth living if it'll never amount to any greatness? "

I am a Year 3 Pol-Sci major, declared major in Year 2, went on SEP and year 3 sem 1 didn't do well cuz I was struggling with mental health issues. Decided save my CAP and S/U-ed 2 mods last sem and resulted in 2 U grades. Totally forgot about graduation/honours requirements. So today I went into AA and found out that I need 27 more MCs to fulfil the 44 Major MCs, aka I have to take 7 pol-sci mods this semester if not I can't even graduate much less be promoted to honours. Emailed to fashelp regarding this but they haven't replied yet. 

Does anyone know if I can appeal to take 5 mods and overload the remaining 2 during honors year? Or what other options do I have? I really don't want to cram all 7 pol-sci mods together this sem. I don't want to apply to extend candidature too due to the extra school fees."
