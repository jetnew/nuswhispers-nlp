62798,"Before the exam, Prof Aaron said not to complain about the CS2100 paper in NUSWhispers. This is not a rant, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank Prof Aaron and Adi for setting this challenging paper. Through this paper, I realise there’s a gap in my knowledge and there’s just still so much more I can learn from CS2100. 

I hope that the future batches taking CS2100 will look at the past year papers (including this one) and realise early where their gaps are. I hope that all these papers can serve as a stepping stone to improve the quality of students in SoC. 

It was one crazy ride. I can never look 0s and 1s the same way anymore after this module. To my fellow CS2100 cohortmates:  we finished CS2100. Congrats to us! Give yourselves a pat on the back, regardless of how the exam went! 

With this I end this post.

62792,"In response to post #62733. 
A Master in Management (MiM) is a pre-experience management degree, while an MBA is a post-experience management degree (typically requiring candidates to have at least 3 years of work experience). 
The content of MiMs at most business schools are very similar to an MBA syllabus. The difference lie mainly in the mode of delivery. MiM is more theoretical while an MBA is more case-study focused, and allows candidates to draw on their fellow classmates' varied work experiences. 
Career progression for both differs too, mainly due to the W.E. MiM graduates will be recruited at analyst level, while MBA graduates will be recruited at a level commensurate to their previous W.E and position. 
MBAs are very popular in North America (being a product of American Business Schools). MiMs are very reputable in the European market (being a product of European Business Schools). In Europe, the concept of MBA is unfamiliar as students typically proceed to their post-graduation studies after undergraduate. An MiM could be seen as the cousin to the MBA. However, US Business Schools have recently been expanding into the MiM market (i.e. Duke, Northwestern, Kellogg). "

62788,"Would like some advice on whether i should give up my malaysian citizenship. 

I was raised in Singapore, so i pretty much speak and relate to the typical singaporean life. To me, Singapore is my homeland. With all these being said however, i still feel a sense of affilation to Malaysia. After all, it is the country where all my relatives are based and i have alot of fond memories there. I love the beautiful landscapes, the people and the food. 

And i always had a dream of making Malaysia a better country especially for non-bumiputeras. I dream of becoming rich and maybe even starting my own business, possibly being the next robert kuok so that i can perhaps, help to improve the facilities and infrastructures in malaysia and help play my part to make it a more fair playing society. I must admit, it is honestly a fair fetched dream and i don't have the slightest idea on how i can accomplish that, except maybe study hard now and think of how i can start a business to be rich?  

Given my love for both Malaysia and Singapore, should i give up my Malaysian citizenship for a Singapore one then? There are definitely more pros than cons to owning a Singapore passport and for many years my relatives in Malaysia are always in disbelief when i tell them i am still a Malaysian. They have always told me to give up on malaysia..saying there is no more hope for non bumiputeras here...

I am slightly conflicted. To be honest, i don't dare to own up that i am Malaysian because i never grew up in Malaysia and neither do i speak Malay or have a good grasp of dialects. On the other hand, i cannot call myself Singaporean too :<"

So I decided , I'm going to go for counselling after finals , because even I , am afraid of myself. The thoughts of ending everything feels so comforting when i feel sad and useless.

62774,"Hello #62774, I used to seek treatment for trauma+depression. This reply is mainly about the medication part that you mentioned. 

Do you know what meds she's taking and what their side effects are? From my own experience, it is possible that taking meds or even changing/stopping dosage can cause big changes in energy levels and personality. The patient may also not notice the changes as much as the people around her. 

This is a long shot, but I might as well make the point with my own horror story coming off Paxil. I took 10mg of Paxil per day (half a pill) for 2 months, and it worked initially. The psychiatrist then told me I could stop any time due to the low dosage, and never warned me about any withdrawal symptoms. So I stopped, and had quite strong physical and emotional side effects for two weeks (similar to the stories here: https://seroxatsecrets.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/the-hell-of-seroxat-withdrawal/). It was only later that I realised how oddly I was behaving to those around me. 

Anyway, it can be serious stuff, and it's good that you are observant and in touch with your person. Maybe you can try to find out more about the medication, and see if there's anything that doesn't add up, or seems dangerous. It's not easy caring for someone without enough knowledge. All the best!"

62769,"Girl who posted #62605 here. I’m very happy in my current relationship. So nope, I’m not looking for anyone to PM or date me. But if you’re a SOC guy interested in a SOC girl who’s already told you she’s single and dropped you a few hints she may be interested, please stop waiting around and make a move already!

To #62642: If you don’t get why guys should take the initiative, it’s very simple. An average girl in uni usually has more than one guy interested in her at any one time. Some of these guys would be actively pursuing her, and taking up her time and attention away from you. Unless she has the opportunity to get to know you for an extended period of time (like what happened with me and my boyfriend), her interest in you would have already peaked and faded some time after meeting you. If you don’t make the 1st move, she might never get the chance to know you better. So if a guy wants to play the waiting game and wait for the girl to make the 1st move, good luck to him! If it happens, he’s a very lucky guy. 

To #62634: You sound like the typical sweet but hopeless/clueless SOC guy I mentioned before. If you’re trying to read and analyse your girlfriend like a computer program, please stop. Girls are more complex than just a bunch of 1s and 0s. Also not all communications are verbal. If your girlfriend is exasperated, it’s because you’re only paying attention to what she says, not what she communicates. There’s a difference. If she loves you enough, she’ll try to teach you. If you love her enough, you’ll try to learn. Good luck!"

62764,"Saw some post recently about dating on CMB and Tinder, so I'm here to share my story

I'm a guy and 2015 Dec was when I downloaded CMB and Tinder and started to use the app in hopes of meeting new people. I used it for 6months maybe but with no real results, mostly didn't click well or just no chemistry and the daily girls I got from CMB became lesser (maybe due to my filter criteria). 

So in 2016, I decided to try out a dating agency GG (I'm quite sure you guys know which one) and signed a package with them, hoping through them will be more focus and higher match rate because of common interest. First girl didn't work out and I was together with girl no.2 (after 4 months of trying to win her). I stopped using the apps during this period. It was a good run, but we ended after 5months.  

I continued to use the app through 2017, going out as frequent as 1-2 girls a month and continued the service by GG. In 2017 sept I met this gorgeous lady which we click very well and we were on the same frequency, however it was quite shortlived after 1 month. I should have read the signs, she was merely using me as companion because she broke up with her ex one month prior. I took awhile to pick myself up because it really hit me hard, I thought she was it.

I continued to use the app to get my mind off things and to move on. In early 2018 I matched with this girl who is totally not in my criteria but decided to give it a go. We dated and got together. Fast forward 1 year later, we are talking about houses and family planning. 

TL;DR: Just keep going out and date, you'll meet many wrong people before you met the right one. Don't give up hope."

Granted, I understand that at the core, CS teaches fundamental knowledge to pursue deep and technical areas, and does not simply prepare one for development jobs that one can learn on the web anyway. Still, at least, little of what job titles are looking for at fresh graduate level are taught in the CS courses.

62744,"Does anyone feel that CS lacks rigour compared to Math? 

I've always found that a lot of CS theory (or at least how it's taught in the modules) play hard and fast with the mathematics involved. It's honestly kind of aggravating, especially when it's evident that the profs gloss over parts that they themselves don't seem too clear on. This is especially bad when some of the “proofs” the CS profs give rely on the abuse of notation or terms used..

This also seems to play into how CS modules seem kind of unstructured, especially (at least, to me since I take CS and Math modules side-by-side) how they’re taught; a typical Math topic has examples designed to illustrate a particular facet or consequence of a theorem or problem, whereas all the CS topics I’ve taken seem to involve logical leaps that the profs just kind of gloss over (or outright admit that we somehow “have” to make the leap).

Part of this is also me just ranting about how CS just doesn’t seem to have its shit together compared to the Math department; I’ve never had a Math prof be unable to answer a question, whereas I’ve had that multiple times. I’ve also never had a Math prof abuse notation or specific terms as badly as some of the CS profs I’ve had. Does anyone else feel this way?

62719,"Hello #62810, I'm #62719. 

You asked, ""how did you decide to leave your previous relationships and what made your current one different?""

Sometimes you meet the right person but at the wrong time. I guess my current one is the right one who appeared at the right time.

I started dating my first ex when we were both 18. We shared many common interests, which got us closer. 

However, as we got closer, I started to see how different we are. These differences often led to arguments. 

I got tired of the endless quarrelling. I felt like we are very different people and I didn't know how to resolve the issues we faced as I didn't know how to communicate well.

Maybe I thought I could find someone who would suit me better. And when this someone appeared, I felt that it was time to leave the rs. 

My second ex was a very sweet, kind and caring guy. We would spend almost every day together and prioritise our rs above everything else.

Along the way, we lost ourselves. We were trapped in our own tiny bubble. We neglected our own social circle and personal life. 

Initially this tiny bubble felt very much like a comfort zone you don't want to get out of. But eventually it felt rather suffocating.

One day you realise you don't know who you are anymore. You are probably just somebody's girlfriend. And suddenly you feel like maybe you want a guy who actually has a life of his own. And when that guy came along, I knew this rs has to end. 

Third ex - smart, funny, sociable, outgoing. All these came at a price. He has alot of female friends, many of whom happen to be quite pretty. He would hang out with them pretty often. 

I felt quite insecure whenever he goes out with these friends. I knew I wasn't confident of myself. I felt his friends are more fun and better looking than me.

I got tired of feeling insecure all the time. And when I met someone who seems like the more serious type of guy, I decided to end my rs. 

This serious guy is my current one and hopefully my last one. lol.

How is he different? Like what I said before, he's a pretty average guy and the only not so average thing about him is his love for me. 

His love is like a burning charcoal. It burns slowly but steadily. Day by day, he tries to learn more and more about me and find ways to show that he cares. Slow and steady wins the race right? 

My first ex taught me the importance of communication. My second ex taught me the importance of independence. My third ex taught me the importance of confidence. My current one taught me love. 

They are all perfect in their own ways. It's just that I met them at different stages of my life. It happens that when I met my current one, I was more ready for a relationship.

You meet different people for a different reason. Just because the relationship ended, it doesn't mean the relationship wasn't real. 

You would always have something to learn from the people you meet. Along the way, you learn to become a better person. And when the time comes, you will be ready to love and meet someone deserving of your love.
