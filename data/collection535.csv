One thing I left out in my original reply to you: The 600-800 you're paying at Apple for the repair goes into them giving you an entirely new logic board. A third-party repair will just replace the small tiny components on your old logic board that broke.

Let me break that down for you: In both cases, your original issue will be fixed, and has the same (hopefully low) chance of recurring again. However, for the third-party option, you still have the accumulated risk of other things breaking down with age, since you are still using your old logic board.

So it is up to you to decide whether spending the 600-800 on the official repair is worth:
1. A firmer repair schedule
2. Practically getting a partial refurbishment of your mac
3. Proper liability coverage in case the same issue happens again in 1 month

53582,"#53582: Yes I'm guilty, and perhaps that is why I'm so scared. I was just a curious quiet evergreen girl who went on the wrong side of Tumblr. I accidentally followed 2 sexually explicit blogs while browsing with my personal account, and only realised months later when more and more weird requests/messages came in (I log into my Tumblr account once in a few months). I've blocked most of them (unfortunately I simply deleted the initial requests before I realised) but it feels more of a reactive rather than a preventive measure. I've since removed all trace of my identity on Tumblr, which initially had posts linked to my Instagram account, but they're still finding me. Changing my url didn't work as Tumblr will somehow link your account. I'm not sure how effective changing my Instagram handle will be, given that my name is in my handle and I've removed my account from the place where this all started. They have even found me on Carousell, a very localised app, which made me fear for my safety, given that most people only stalk on social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. To add to this mess, I have been badly affected by the recent Facebook security incident, and am afraid my information can be used to impersonate or stalk me even further. Is there any way to know how these people are finding my accounts and to end this stalking/harassment once and for all?"

The firm I am in has pretty flexible working hours, no one will question why you're 30 min late for work or if you leave early to attend to personal matters or lessons. But I have a gripe about people who are uninterested to learn. You're on attachment, please at least try to learn something useful during these 6 months.

The interns that i have are unmotivated and uninterested. Simple tasks that were given to them, they can take weeks to complete. If you ask, we will teach. The amount of knowledge that you can acquire throughout your IA period depends on your learning attitude. If you're laid back and don't approach seniors for guidance, they will assume that you know what you're doing and they'll leave you alone.  They will expect the completed work to be delivered.

53556,"When I was a kid, my parents taught me the same formula for success that most of us probably learned: go to school, study hard, and get good grades so you can get a safe, secure, high-paying job with benefits and your job will take care of you. Later in my life I came to realize that this education system is not bolstering my skills, knowledge and abilities, rather it has limited my opportunities and understanding. This whole education system taught us the blueprint for working for others, serving others, and making them rich through our hard work.

Have we ever thought where will this outdated education system lead us? What will be our future? I can assure most peoples’ future if they keep following this system. We will be working for other, making them attain their financial success through our hard works. If we ask students “why do you join institution, college or university?”, we often hear the same answer- to get a good and secure job in a big company or a renowned employer. My concern here is not what is the answer but whose is that answer. Going to university and getting a degree with good grades to get a secure job with benefits is actually not their own personal opinion. Most of us are so brainwashed by our society and authority that we should go college to secure our future. Our educational system and culture train us, from the cradle to the grave, to follow this obsolete pattern that worked a century before.

This education system has implanted, in our brain, a solid formula to obediently follow authority that is damaging our own future. Yes, it has taught us how to earn money but not how to make money. There is a great difference between earning money and making money. I believe earning money means getting a paycheck from an employer by working for them. Paycheck is actually trading our time for money. We get paid per hour of our service and work. But don’t get me wrong here, I’m not saying employment is a bad thing. I’m just saying it’s only one way of generating income, and one that is extremely limited.
We all see our live from our own core values. Some people may love being employees, while others hate it. Some people love owning companies, but do not want to run them. Certain people love investing, while others see only the risk of losing money. Most of us are a little of each of these characters. I believe we all have our own goals and I categorized these goals into two types: social success and financial success. Social success means gaining reputations through service while financial success means making money and live the life we want to live. We all are running for any of these two things. But we are not sure whether we are able to achieve it or not.

I don’t mean you have to quit your college to attain your future. I only mean don’t fall in the trap of this education system that will lead us nowhere than to works as a slave for others. Who will you blame for your future? Authority? Society? No, it’s all our fault, our weaknesses because we and only we have the power to take control and determine our destiny. The only way for all of us to have a genuinely secure future is to take control of our future. For that, we have to change our mindsets because what is in our head will be in our hand. First, we have to choose our destiny and feed only the things that will take us closer to that destiny rather than following the formula that are deep-seated in our brain by someone else.

But here lies the most tragic thing, we all know that this education system has ruined us and will lead us to nowhere than to make other peoples’ dream come true. So why don’t we take the actions? Why don’t we change our way of thinking? Why don’t we alter our pattern? The reason is because we don’t believe ourselves. Yes, the one thing that hold all of us back to go against this pattern is some degree of self-doubt and fear because these are the greatest distraction of our personal genius. So, if we want to control our life and destiny, if we want real freedom, freedom to set our own schedules, spend time with friends and families, doing the thing we love to do, living the life we want to live and we are designed to live- a life of passion, excitement, fulfillment and success then it’s the time to pack all of our stuffs and move on towards our destiny."

53550,"The only social interaction I have outside of my family are my plushies, aside from a minority of friends I meet up with rarely. I am just too awkward to talk to others properly in real life. Picture Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory but way worse than him, at least he has close friends. 

When I try to talk to others in real life, they shun me because I think they find me obnoxious because everything I say seems so closed and kind of leave them no room to answer (even when I don't intend to), sometimes I try to talk to people but words come out at the weirdest timings so it seems like I am interrupted their conversations, or I talk about the most retarded things...

53549,"I love to (try to) lead and organize events for other people. I love reading and applying for online courses to supplement my learning. I love bundling commitments after commitments to get myself busy.

But the biggest problem is, I don't follow through ANYTHING that I set myself to do at the start. As a leader, I slacken off, start ponning exco meetings, doing less work than I'd promised, and not constantly being ""on the ball"" as what I know is expected of an exco member. 

I have probably close to forty ""started but gave up somewhere at the start/in the early middle"" Coursera/EdX  courses stuck in my bookmark somewhere, that I'm either too lazy or unmotivated to click to continue learning. Then I forget everything and it's pretty much useless to continue anymore, and I just delete that bookmark.

Commitment-wise, I do just a bit of everything - it's quantity over quality, but I simply love that. I'm a faster learner, and I can get things done pretty well, but I'm just so lazy to motivate myself to do anything at home. When I should be planning for the next major event/delegate tasks to my juniors/commence e-learning/practise that piece for a duet performance with my friend/prepare tuition materials for my next student, I end up procrastinating and just browsing the web, having a good laugh with Season 5's Brooklyn, dating, etc etc...

I honestly don't know if this phenomena is actually normal, or I'm really really bad at following through commitments. I write my to-do lists that go neglected, that evolve from ""daily"" tasks to ""weekly"" tasks and then to ""just do them sometime this lifespan"" tasks. If I had better motivation, I'm very sure I would be able to do so much more, but I just don't see the point of a lot of things. Makes me feel that if I don't see something immediately tangible come out of it, I don't immediately recognize the need and drive to do it.

53538,"I have a good friend who is rich, not in terms of money, but in non-material terms, like kindness, generosity, experience, advice etc. He is very street-savvy and knows the best places to go to have a good time, and he enjoys bringing us along to these places. He finds it fulfilling to be sharing these riches with his friends, and I have been a fairly frequent recipient, and I'm super grateful to him for that.

I've been on the receiving end so much so I'm very willing to reciprocate the same qualities back to him. Unfortunately this is where I get annoyed, because he is very disinterested with whatever I provide him? For example when I try to give him well-intentioned advice, he starts getting defensive, as if an outsider's opinion is always inferior to his own opinions.

When I give him food/books recommendations, he drifts off to lala land and then comes back momentarily to give me a few polite nods. Sometimes he tries to one-up me by saying he knows an even better place, or an even better book, and insinuates I should stop assuming that I know more than him, because obviously he's the one who's more savvy right. And obviously we've never been to any place which I would recommend because of how uninterested he is, and he'd suggest a different place, and we end up going to that place.

Am I thinking too much if I conclude that his reason for being so generous with his ""riches"" is primarily to show off what he has, and less because he genuinely wants to share them with the people that matter to him? He's such a good giver, and I try my best to be a good receiver. I try my best to be a good giver, but he's such a bad recipient and he's not even trying.

I have no intentions to break off this friendship, but I'm thinking of voicing my concerns with him. But I'm afraid his defensive nature might come out again and then it might permanently affect this friendship. He can be quite temperamental. I've seen him raise his voice and express his anger publicly before, at the slightest of offences. It's funny because I genuinely admire his savviness and grateful for his generosity, but at the same time fearful of his temperament and defensiveness. What should I do??

I am graduating but I am doing a difficult module and I had been very stressed about not being able to even pass it.... 

Is there bell curve for even the D grade? Or can you pass once you hit a minimum amount of marks? 

Thank you every one!! <3 :)"
