64794,"Hi, I'm serving NS now as a stay out clerk and about to finish my ACCA papers. I also have a place in NUS Accountancy, is it worth to take an accountancy degree if I already have my ACCA?"
64790,"I am not from Nus but i do wish to transfer to Nus. I had applied for a transfer too but, sadly, my application was rejected. Should i write in to the Dean to appeal or is it not worth it?"
64785,"@Prof Ben Leong (reply to #64785) I find that an AI club can cater to both competitive AI programmers and people who wish to explore AI further in depth. Given that there are many papers established on a day to day basis on new AI advancements (e.g we recently have papers mentioning about Generative Adversarial Networks / Efficientnets / Maximising accuracy training only using one epoch), it is impossible to cover each of them on a daily basis, having a club would allow for information sharing and also creating models which are way more accurate than if you were to do it alone. Also, given that AI is a very hot topic in recent years, there are certainly a lot of people seeking to explore AI further in depth.
Also, may i know why the right question to ask would be ""Why do we need a club for AI?"" As per my understanding, clubs like NUS Hackers / NUS Greyhats are set up because there are people interested in areas like hacking and cyber security. It'd certainly be great if you can explain why we need clubs for NUS Hackers / NUS Greyhats. 
Thank you very much!"
64784,I am a freshman who didn't get a hall offer after the first round of results today:/ I was wondering did anyone appeal during the second round and actually get what they wanted?
64783,"Can women shed light on this, what if you're not romantically interested in a guy at the start but after hanging out over a sustained period of time, you realize he has great personality and character, and he even helped you through your darkest period, would you give him a chance?"
64780,"Hi, I specialise in food science. Insects contain large amounts of protein, and can provide for a lot of the nutrients our body needs. On my recent trip to overseas, I ate some insects. I have to say they taste amazing. Believe me, it tastes much better than it looks. It can also help reduce global warming because less they don’t give out as much carbon dioxide as animals.

This is my suggestion: set up a stall in every canteen in nus selling insects. One way is to combine it with the mala stall. The various spices they use go very well with such insects. Many of the mala stall owners are from China, so they should be familiar with the concept since it is common in their hometowns. To encourage people to eat insects at the start, they should throw in a few insects for free for every mala purchased.

Second suggestion: flour can be made from grinding insects into powder. This type of flour has higher protein content than regular flour. So the Arise & Shine bakeries should start to use flour made from insects to make their bread. I bet that most people eating the bread won’t even notice the difference if the flour was changed. To encourage people to accept this new type of flour at the start, they should consider quietly changing the type of flour without people knowing.

Together, we can help to reduce global hunger and global warming by consuming insect products."

64775,"Some commenters here really have no empathy and are quick to judge. This is a confession page - it's for people to talk about their frustrations and insecurities, to anonymously say whatever they wouldn't say in real life. Like with the confessions where OP is insecure about being unable to get into a relationship. People were shitting on them and blaming their ""whining"" on not being able to get attached when there's no indication that OP is whiny in front of prospective dates. 

And honestly, who doesn't have their own insecurities? Let people vent la. You think telling them to just /not/ be insecure will magically solve anything? ""Dude just stop being depressed/stop complaining about it duh"" ayy lmao"
64773,"Hi. I am currently serving National Service and I am graded PES E for Autism Spectrum Disorder.

64771,"Hi! I'm the OP of #64771 (Tall girl getting easily attracted to tall guys), I didn't expect so many replies haha but I guess I would like to clarify/address some questions in the comments:

For my height, it's >175cm (so yeah, taller than the average sg male kind of tall). As for the guy I find myself slightly attracted to at work, we do chat daily and get along fairly well. I think he's a nice guy, but I could say the same about other guys at the office. His appearance isn't my type at all either, other than his height. I just don't wish to fall into the trap of being attracted to someone just for their height, since I know it's a problem of mine. 

I appreciate the genuine replies in my original post, though! :)"

64769,"I graduate next year and just a few days agoI applied to the cadet pilot (an initial) program under SIA and got rejected at the online application stage. I checked the requirements and I do meet the basic ones (height, eyesight etc).

64762,"To OP of #64751, I generally agree with your post. But your last sentence “less drastic steps like meat free monday might be a good start”, I cannot accept. In fact I am outraged by this statement.

First, isn’t meat free Monday imposing a diet which others don’t like once every week. Do you think this is fair? And not to forget those people you mentioned in your post that some people who need to eat meat for health reasons: what are they going to do every Monday? Carry out fasting?

Second, you said it is a “good start”. So let me ask you, what is a “good end”? Make all stores vegan? But that would contradict your view that “i dont believe ALL stalls should be made vegan”. So I really don’t know what your overall idea for the long run is.

And also my personal view is that having such a “good start” can be a slippery slope to something more extreme: reducing variety of meat choices, shortage of options etc. To those kind of left wing people who espouse veganism, “if you give them an inch, they will demand a mile”, just to borrow a phrase from one of the comments in the earlier post on vegan. 

So if you realise you don’t like vegan food after they introduce one or two stores, plus the meat free Monday, do you think you can reverse the process towards veganism, let alone to stop it in its tracks?

P.s. if meat free mondays are implemented next semester, I will bring my own canned luncheon meat and/or bacon and ham every Monday."
64760,"Hello! Can any seniors taking Quantative finance shed some light on this course? Also, what are the job prospects like? Thanks! :)"
64759,"After reading #64691’s post, I do feel that we should do more to reduce our carbon footprint. Although, I do find it a tad too extreme to limit everyone’s consumption to a vegan diet in NUS. 

Instead, we should reduce our energy consumption. Whenever I stay back late at different studying spots in U town or Engine auditorium there is always air-con blasting at full strength through out the night. In my opinion, we should switch off the air-con in the less crowded studying spots such as lecture theatres during certain hours such as from 10pm to 7am. This would let the school save on electricity bills and also on energy consumption which comes from harmful fossil fuels. 

Perhaps a trial period can be introduced to slowly introduce this measure to everyone. I do believe we all have a part to play to combat climate change."
64758,"Given that mala stores around campus are highly demanded for but enjoy a monopoly in their areas, NUS should set up more mala stores around campus. The price and quality at UTown Fine Food is ridiculous, overpriced (twice the price outside NUS) yet one of the worst malas I've ever eaten. (I have to eat it everyday because it is my favourite dish.) NUS should invite someone else to set up a mala store at UTown Food Clique. ????‍♂️ monopolies (I should report this to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore.)"

64756,"Looking at so many posts of people being single, I am starting to get worried myself.

Firstly, I am a guy standing at only 170cm in height. Girls these days are approaching close to 170cm in height, maybe at least 165cm which means that they have the tendency to go for the much taller guys. Working at tanjong pagar area, the OLs there are clearly way above me. It is difficult to even find one that is below the benchmark.


Secondly, I am not even close to average looking. Most other guys out there are blessed with good genes and good looks, exhibiting the Lee Min Ho vibe. This worsens the competition.

Thirdly, despite having years of working experience, my salary is  stuck  at 4k per month, way below what many people are earning.

Disappointment...."

64748,My ex was a NUS student in her final year. I just started my career at that time. Honestly it wasn't anyone's fault we just didn't have time and we fell out. If you guys are dating in NUS in the final year just remember to spend time with each other
64747,"1 month after breaking up, my ex boyfriend and I slept together... 4 times. Before doing it, he would remind me to be ""impartial"", ""neutral"", ""no feelings attached ok?""
Every session was as passionate as before we separated – lots of teasing, making out, going down on each other, and even cuddling after. We still have feelings for each other, but we also have needs which can be mutually met. Sidenote: he keeps saying that he wants to be my best / closest friend and does not want me to cut him off. But knowing me, I will definitely fall back in love should I continue this friendship. Would being FWBs be an option? or is it a terrible idea?"
64746,How many times should you initiate meetup with an old friend if he or she doesn't initiate at all and doesn't seem to appreciate your efforts?
64745,"As I lie on my bed, I kept thinking about my ex as I read the email about the commencement ceremony. Memories kept flooding my mind as I thought about how I initiated the breakup. 

It was tough dealing with the breakup alone and I still haven't moved on even after a few years. But, I felt that I have made the right decision, since she moved on quickly, a few months after the breakup She also seems much happier with the new person in her life, constantly posting happy couple photos and insta stories, as opposed to sad and emotional quotes when she's with me. Guess I finally understand what it means to love someone, even if it means having to let go and knowing that she will be better off with someone else.

I still remember how I was planning to invite her to my commencement ceremony and thank her for being part of my life, but I guess it's not possible now."

64740,There are so many guys in NUSWhispers comments who are salty about not having a gf but my experience is so different in real life. Boys seem to just the physical intimacy... and not provide the emotional support that comes with being in a relationship.
64739,"NOT A RELATIONSHIP ISSUE but please help a sista out. Coming from a not so well-to-do family background, I have been working part time since year 1 to support my own expenses :( One of them being my phone bill which can be INSANE on months where I stream too many Youtube videos on the train (always regret when I see the final amount >$100 of my stupid bil).

Recently I have been more diligent in finding out why am I spending so much on my mobile bill... I realised that it was because I have been exceeding my pathetic 6gb data threshold every month and my occasional day trip to JB???

This is when I decided I need to switch telco. My contract is ending soon, any good suggestions?"
64737,"[20M] Entering uni in a month or so and I feel like absolute shit. I've been a social outcast my entire friends - rarely had any friends at all, never had any friends who were women, and I'm 100% sure that I'm not going to fit in in uni. 

For some reason something about me puts people off. And before anyone brings it up, the simple stupid stuff e.g. dressing/hygiene aren't a problem for me. Plus I've been in a relationship before so I know I'm not completely unattractive. But for some reason people avoid me and I'm never able to get close to anyone.

I feel like I should just end my life before uni starts. Please advise"
64735,"If she doesn't like others to find out about the relationship, this is surely a red flag isn't it?"
64734,"For those who were criticising veganism:
It's up to you whether you want to be vegan or not. However, I read that many mentioned that vegans kill plants etc etc, just like how animals are killed. 
Not necessarily. Some, if not most of the plant parts we eat may be regenerated/allow the plant to remain alive. This is unlike animal parts where to extract one part, the entire animal is killed.
Also, vegan or vegetarian food don't necessarily taste like cardboard/ grass. it just depends on the way you cook. Take indian cuisine for example. Some of the dishes taste so good and even make people wonder whether it's really vegetarian.
Finally, animals are overfed/ forcefed before slaughter. Therefore they tend to belch more than they would, producing more methane than usual. Not sure how significant this is, but definitely a contribution to global warming.
Just my two cents."
64733,"To OP of #64691, I strongly agree with your idea of reducing meat consumption. I would like to suggest an alternative method, you can call it a sort of compromise. Those who like meat can continue to eat meat in school canteens while at the same time reducing overall meat consumption using this method.

The method I’m referring to is introducing a tax on all meat products sold in canteens. If you look at it in the economic sense, you can call meat a “demerit good”, with negative externalities. In other words, the price of meat is too cheap to reflect the actual cost which it does harm to the society in terms of CO2 emissions. Too low price causes us to consume more meat than we should, so we should raise the price to reduce overall consumption. I suggest that the tax should be on a similar proportion to alcohol tax, maybe 50% of original price?

The extra money collected from this tax can be used to fund the university to provide us with better facilities, or even better, invest in green facilities such as the zero carbon footprint building near/in FASS (if I remember correctly?)

To those naysayers calling for the OP in the other article to go and die, I say to them, think about the world you want to live in 50 years from now. Think about the world your children will live in. How will you answer them if they ask you why you never play your part to reduce climate change?"
64730,"I am reading lot of posts about implementing army like work culture and practices in normal working environment.

I strongly agree with brothers about the discipline and punctuality practices. 

But I do NOT agree of suggestions like ""your boss is always rite"" and taking blind orders from the boss. From my 10+ years of industry experiences at multiple organisation I have learned one thing. It is about ""collaboration"" rather then being obedient to the boss. The moment the bosses behaves like army generals the culture becomes very toxic. Remember we are NOT fightin war in professional life. I found successful organisation is where the top hierarchy is approachable and people are treated equally. Bosses are not there just to fill up Excel sheet status rather their job is to do your job well. Leave the organisation where bosses are just demanding only status to fill up PPT and excel sheets."

I kept saying I dont like the feelings of being lied to, and he told me he feel bad enough and telling me to stop causing him pain by doing so. How can I get over it? Am I being too harsh on him?"
64717,"#64691 first of all I just wanna say I think your idea is commendable even though very unlikely feasible since not everyone can live off plant proteins alone (most probably can) and people love meat too much. Anyway this is more of a rant directed towards some of the reactionary comments. It’s honestly disappointing some people still think climate change is a first world problem when the poor are the most vulnerable (think floods, heat waves with poor housing infrastructure etc.) and that some people actually cursed OP for having a less than optimal solution?? Someone even said you’re better off dead???? That’s insane?? Although it’s true not having kids is one of the best ways to reduce ur carbon emissions, and I guess not being alive as well would reduce ur carbon footprint...but still...how could you tell someone they’re better off dead just because you think their suggestion (to help others I might add) isn’t a good one? That’s messed up. Rly hope people can learn more about climate change (climate change the facts is a good start) and become more open to conversation in general. Shitting on each other is probably not going to make the world a better place (but yeah I guess I can’t assume all of you want to live in a better place or have a positive impact in your life)"

64708,"I need some real advice here, because I don’t know who else or where else to ask. Thanks in advance.

My hostel mate aka “bunk mate” on campus is a crazy dude. Makes me do area cleaning in our room to army standards (means rub finger over no dust). Makes me standardize my cabinet to army standards, i.e. to say toothbrush, shaver etc all must be in standard position. Enforces lights out timing at 2230. Wakes up at 0530 and makes me do 5bx with him. Walk in step to “cookhouse” for breakfast (thank god no marching). Worst of all, tekan sessions (lasting 1 hour) if standards not adhered to. I am 110% sure he has some psychiatric issue.

Reason why I let him exercise such control over our room and habits is because his parents has huge influence in the industry that we are going to go into (we are in the same course), so I don’t want to offend anyone because it may affect my prospects. This nonsense is driving me crazy. What should I do?"

1) I actually spent $30,000 on her and our dates. I made a calculation error last time, $15,000 is when you average out between the 2 of us.
2) Her birthday is coming soon in early August. We always go on overseas trip together for that occasion. She wants to go to Europe this year. If we go this year, I expect to spend another $6000 between the two of us. I have to decide whether to book in a week or two.
Is there any way out of this? I’m still very hesitant to break up with my girlfriend."
64701,"Hmm just wondering if there is any other way to assure your partner that they are beautiful and that what really matters is her personality. 

Because my gf experienced a mishap last feb where the glass door in her bathroom shattered into pieces, leaving a minor cut on her face and some on her arms etc. She is healing rather quickly but the scar on her face hasnt gone away yet (not sure if it will really disappear) which results in the lack of self esteem. Understand this is may be a big blow to any other girl hence i always assure her that she is beautiful, giving her lots of attention and love etc but she doesnt seem to be convince. Furthermore, she has toned down from a bubbly girl to a rather reserved person. This problem has bothered me quite a while as i really miss the genuine smile and laughter which she had way back then and its rarely seen now."

Till this day, I kind of regretted it because eye contact means a lot. Probably it is not meant to be right.....?"
