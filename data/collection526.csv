52695,"Hi, I took a module last semester and got an F grade. It was a UE. I know it killed my CAP but does anyone know if the 4 MCs count towards graduation? Or do I have to take another 4 MCs to replace? "
52692,"The other day, I was asking for the extra marks that have been accidentally deducted from my graded assignment .

To my surprise, he told me that getting marks shouldnt be my priority, learning should be.....

So this set me thinking, could I have paid less school fees for his salary, since his job is to teach us?"
52689,I see my comment about economics got the smug losers and virtue signallers out of their dens. I have seen the syllabus and a lot of it is arcane and debunked nonsense. For eg- At biz school the money and banking course refers to reading material from Fred mishkin who was caught Making fake reports for money. There’s loads more examples. This just shows how ignorant or contemptuous  your professors are and as a result you will be too. 
52688,How much do people study? I see everyone always having a lot of fun on instagram and everyone seems to be doing well academically while im a loner but still struggling with my work 
52685,"I recently attended a dinner event where I had a chance to sit together with this really cute & funny girl at the same table. We exchanged looks & had many grins/laughter throughout the whole event. I'm not sure how she felt but I felt that we clicked really well. I got her number at the end of the event & at the very least I texted her saying how it was nice to have met her! Beyond that, this shy boy is unsure what to do next. Any advice would be great!"
52684,Can someone please help me? I have friends but I can't talk to any of them. I feel so alone. Why does my life have to be so complicated. Why do I like someone else even though I have a girlfriend. Why am I feeling so conflicted now. Is there some drug I can take to stop feeling. Somebody help me please. I want to stop feeling.
52681,"The recent fiasco over the nyjc memes page was unwarranted. This is the problem of political correctness that we are increasingly facing today; I would go as far as to argue that political correctness is the key driver of censorship. We are treading down a dangerous path where people can no longer speak freely without fear of offending somebody (even if that is just one person). 

""Feeling accomplished that I single-handedly made the nyjc meme page - with close to 9.6k followers - close down and caused an uproar among the jc kiddos meme page community hahahaha""

I am absolutely disgusted especially by how self-righteous and arrogant he is. He is the literal embodiment of a keyboard warrior - lecturing others while on an imaginary pedestal of ""maturity"", all while hiding behind the comfort of anonymity. 

Besides, why visit meme pages if you are so sensitive to the content? Nobody goes into a whore house to espouse morality, so please do yourself a favour and get off that high horse. I personally feel that one's perceptions of your own supposed maturity are subjective - you don't affirm that yourself, just like how you don't singlehandedly claim you are the most good-looking, or the most intelligent. 

In any case, good luck in the real world out there if you intend on being such a prickly, self-entitled snowflake. 

(Just a rant to get this off my chest. I did none of that vigilante identity digging work - the guy publicly revealed himself on Twitter from the aforementioned tweet and is also an NUS student.)"

52676,"Mostly year 4s and above may know, about the spiritual predecessor of NUSWhispers, NUS Confessions. Recently I tried to find it, but there's only a page with a few posts. As for the photos, most of them is this ms paint scribbled NUS word.

So sad, something which existed in the public suddenly all gone. All the submissions and replies gone. It's like a part of my history suddenly disappeared. This got me wondering, what's the plan for NUSWhispers in the future? If it's to be discontinued, will all the posts be left alone or will they be wiped?"
52674,"To the guys out there, not every girl loves money/looks more than personality. Not every girl wants a 'fun' guy, some prefer a guy who is husband-material, responsible and loyal. Not every girl wants guys who buy them stuff all the time, and spend so much on them. All a girl wants is to feel loved, feel important, and feel like the guy puts in effort. But then of course looks does matter to a certain extent. Guys don't have to look like a model or be above average. I think girls would prefer dating an average looking guy with a nice personality than date a very hot guy who is self-centered/obsessed with himself."

52653,"There’s this new guy intern at my work place that reminds me so strongly of my crush from jc class. Not only does he look like my crush, the way he talks, his mannerism, the way he smiles, the way he makes lame jokes, it feels like it’s the same person. I can’t believe that he is also a leftie. 

Seeing him in the office feels like I am back to school again, when my crush is always in such a close proximity, yet I never had the courage to make a move. Really feel like taking a step to know this guy better but it just feels wrong because I probably feel something for him because of someone I knew and not because I really like him. 

Then again, even if I did make a move he might not like me back, then it will just be another terrible heartache an embarrassment.

It's probably not your height. It's probably how you look.

This feel so difficult - especially for someone who is struggling with mental illness. Just like myself. 

People always say to speak to a counsellor when you have difficult feelings. But what if the one who left, is the counsellor?

52635,"Referring to my previous confession #52572,
1. I want to clarify that the quiet girl in my FAS1101 tutorial stole my idea which the prof asked me to discuss in the previous tutorial. I just wanted a way to complain and de-stress myself and just in case the girl sees the confession, she will feel guilty.

2. I had a new essay done at the cost of not sleeping for a night on that day.

3. I am on a scholarship requiring a certain CAP for my degrees. (For those who said I need to improve my writing, despite my A Levels rankpoint, I come from a poor family background and my parents are hawkers who communicates in Chinese and tries their best to afford my school fees.) I was very depressed when someone implied that I am spoilt and complained for no reason.

4. It has been stressful for me to take ddp but I really need the scholarship to pay the school fees and travel fees. Without it, I will probably drop out of uni.

5. I wrote the previous confession when I was sick with a high fever. I have been on and off sick for a month now due to burning midnight oil daily."

52630,"So I've recently read that there was no challenger candidate to Science or Sports Club because the incumbent club members refused to nominate the challenger candidate. As a alumnus of Science Faculty, this is a disturbing development. I have made the decision to withdraw my contributions to the university until this clear election-rigging rules are amended, and I urge my fellow alumni to do the same. Same for the graduating students, when they ask you to donate to the school before your convocation, tell them you are not donating and the reason why. 

If the incumbent NUSSU team will not listen to the current students, then us alumni who fund many of the grants and scholarships and programmes in NUS should step up to apply pressure to the school"

52605,"The MRT East-West line track fault between Jurong East and Clementi on 19/9/2018 clearly shows top level mismanagement.

There needs to be a parallel MRT line running from Jurong to CBD. At least with the DTL, the East side of Singapore has multiple redundancies in the event of a MRT breakdown. Currently, there is no such redundancy for the critical Jurong area until at least 2030.

See, the thing is that the West part of the East-West line is overloaded. It has been extended greatly to accommodate six additional stations from the original terminal at Boon Lay. That's a 46% increase from the original designed capacity.

That area also took on the additional load from housing estates like Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang, both are incredibly dense towns with relatively poorly designed road infrastructure, compared to Yishun, Ang Mo Kio and Tampines.

I believe the JRL project, specifically the section between Jurong East and the proposed future station at Haw Par Villa, should be pushed forward and be number one priority right now. Or at least, an additional MRT track should be constructed to ease the bottleneck between Jurong East and Buona Vista.

In the meantime, there should be compartmentalization of tracks. A track fault should not impact the entire or half of the MRT line. If a track fault occurs between Jurong East and Clementi, then trains should turn around at Jurong East and turn around at Clementi (i.e. more turn-around points must be built). It would have been better if SMRT stopped train service between those two stations and fixed the issue than to continue at slower speed. Think about it this way, would you cross a suspension bridge if one cable snapped but the bridge is still fine?

Anyway, good job to those people at LTA, SBS and SMRT working hard to resolve these problems. Nowadays, the North-South line and other lines have lesser delays and breakdowns all thanks to you guys. Cheers!

TLDR; Identify bottlenecks and build more redundancies at choke-points."

52602,"I have been friends with him for years. However, he always seems to prioritise his acquaintances over me.  When I asked him about it, he claims that it is because I am close to him and I would be his friend anyway no matter what happen, hence, there is no need to put in any effort. Recently, it was my birthday, he knew and he did not even bother wishing me. But when it was one of his og mates birthday, he travelled all the way from Pasir Ris to NUS to celebrate. TBH, I feel a little upset. He is also a super passive person who follows the crowd. 95% of our meetings are initiated by me. But despite all, we still meet at least once a week to talk, study or eat. My friends suggest that I should be patient with him and maintain status quo. However, I feel tired and start to question myself if he is really a friend. I used to think he is my close friend as I am comfortable entering his room without knocking and just treat it as my own room, and I feel that I could look up to him for advices.

52600,"Why does everyone claim to be an introvert nowadays? It's really just an insult to the real introverts out there. 

""Oh. I'm an introvert and stepping outta my comfort zone."" You hear this alot nowadays, in interviews, in personal relfections, in beauty pageants, competitions and in conversations to describe oneself.
It sounds so fake. They dont act like it. You check their Instagram and they have 1000+ followers and tons of photos of them showing off in bikini and washboard abs and posting an Insta story every hour.

Even those extroverts will dare call themselves at least a ""half introvert"" or some other made up term. Like, what is that? You see the person hanging out with a large cliche 24/7, drinking and going clubbing and going all rabak, and when asked to describe, they're like ""aah...I may not look like it but I'm actually very shy ah, I'm an introverted person one"".

Gimme a break. And well, I suppose no one will dare call themselves extroverts anyway since it sounds self-appraising. Thus, in this world, apparently every millenial is an introvert.

I'll tell you who the real introverts are though. They're the ones with only one or two or no friends at all. The ones who usually eat alone at the canteen and mind their business. The ones with a blank profile pic and hardly uploads on instagram or facebook or better yet, have none at all. And the ones like me that post a silly rant on NUSWhispers anonymously.


And lastly, real introverts dont even call themselves introverts. "
