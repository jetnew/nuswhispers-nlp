61099,Any psychology majors know about level 4K grading? I got 25th percentile for around 65% of the grade. I predict my overall grade to be 70. Will that be a C or D? :( The module has more than 40 students so it’s subjected to bell curve.
61097,Anyone lost a very close friend before? How do u guys make the other party forgive u and give u another chance? All along i was the one i was the one who fked up but i really dont want to lose my friend.
61096,"[[Unpopular opinion]]

Recently, there is a scandal involving this guy z from NUS.

 I just want to say ,sure, this guy is definitely in the wrong. However, it takes 2 hands to clap.

If you thirsty girls dint give him the opportunity to play around with you, then we might not have the outcome that is currently happening now.

It is obvious that you girls like the thrill of playing with fire. For example, you get in the room with him one to one (even though u know his character) and all the other acts that give the other party the wrong impression. 

Don't play with fire and afterwards complain why did you get burned by the fire. Ask yourself this question, who was the one that lighted the fire in the first place?(:

61095,"i will be matriculating into NUS this year as a freshman. While this piece of news may serve as a joy for many others, but for me,i am in a dilemma. 

I feel like friendships are very important, especially when you are studying full time.  Through my experience, having friends are actually one of the main highlights of studying full time

However i feel like i have this friendship curse. In Poly, i come from IT school. In that kind of place, you do not get many opportunities to make new friends. This is because in my opinion, the people there are just... they just like to be alone and do not like socializing.

 Even within my small social circle, we only talk when there is school and rarely hang out with each other during the holidays.In my honest opinion, i feel like i have no friends at all in poly.

I am very afraid that the same thing will happen to me once i enter nus. FYI, i will be under the school of computing.If this is the case, i rather just study part time and continue working in my current intern company. This way, although i have no friends, but i am at least earning an income and enriching my working experience.

 I feel like this is much better than studying full time, as compared to studying full time and then having no friends and then when it comes to holidays,i will have to find odd jobs like giving tuition which honestly, does not allow me to earn much and neither does it boost my portfolio as well.

Any advice?

You family loves her; you guys talk about everything under the sun; you guys never quarrel; you guys remain loving despite being in a LDR for a few months. But one day, the girl's priorities shifted. She decided that she needed to spend more time at work, networking 2-3 times a week, drinking and coming home late in the wee hours of the morning. Verily, you tried to be understanding and supportive, but it is mentally draining. It might be that they are at different phases in life right now, but is it still worth holding on to her?

i was dated a manipulative guy long ago and after he dumped me, he started to see my close friend a year later. while they were dating, i've always wondered if i should let my friend know about how manipulative he was (at that point of time, i didn't dare to confide in anyone about him) and warn her about him. i thought maybe after a year he changed to be a better person. i didn't know if i would be doing the right thing if i told her and ruin their r/s. i didn't tell her about it in the end and they broke up eventually.

fast forward 2-3 years later, i finally had the courage to ask my friend about her experiences w the dude and she told me how manipulative he was and he did to her exactly what he did to me. she asked me why didn't i tell her about him then and wow i immediately felt so bad.

So Im decising btw going NUS/ SMU, Sorry Pulau NTU :(. Now, I know that SMU have a higher pay and many employers favour a SMU degree over a NUS one etc etc etc. But I come from a really competitive/conservative/traditional/weird? Family. Basically my parents take the reputation of a university very seriously and My mum would definitely pressure me into going NUS because NUS is ranked 11 in the world and SMU is... 500. Dont tell me that "" Oh, ranking doesnt matter"", because it does. In fact when I told me father I wanted to go SMU, my father just went :""... Is that a private University?"" 

I really dont know what to do. I don't wanna go against my parents wishes/ let them down. I mean personally I would prefer going SMU but a part of me wants to go NUS simply for NUS being a much more reputable uni and my parents can probably ""gloat"" to their friends that their daughter studies in NUS. 

Perhaps I might sound elitist/ naiive for thinking this way, or you can even blame my upbringing, but I just want to make my parents proud. "

It seems that you are just a insecure prick and have no faith in your girl. You resort to violence to keep guys away and this tells a lot about you. You are abusive and might harm her in future so please consult UHC.
Warning her or resorting to unorthodox method to keep her in your clutches only proves that you are immature. I have seen lot of guys hurting girls this way but they have the courage to voice it out but not pulling little tricks behind her. 
While you called other guys selfish, you are the real manipulative and selfish guy. It might be wrong to break up couples but should the girls just stick with their Boyfriends even if they know that their boyfriends are not the one they should be with?

We have been through many ups and downs together, surviving through JC (we went to different JC) and my army periods. Fast forward to today, she has graduated from NUS and working for 2 years while I'm in my 4th year since we are of the same age. The issue is this, she has changed so much, so much so that she's almost a different person from when we started. The biggest transformation occurred when she started working. She's now a highly ambitious, high achieving career woman who enjoys the finer things in life. She's climbed so fast in her career that she's now earning about 2.5x the average starting salary expected for my course. Whenever we are together, I feel so alien and have a feeling as if I am talking to a familiar stranger who is so high up and dominating. It's as though I am talking to a boss. I really feel like quitting as I know that she is almost unlikely to change even after getting married. It's very hard for me to accept that I'll be signing up to live with a big career woman forever as I'll very much prefer to live a low key and simple life by earning enough to live an average lifestyle. Yet something is holding me back from cutting it all off on account of our so many years together and I wonder if it is easy for me find another girl to start all over again. I also have practically zero friends and social life as I've invested so much into the relationship. I feel so torn and stuck in this muddy situation. Can someone help me out?"

I thought we will be fine, but fast forward 8 months, I'm really lonely. Sure, we do skype about once a week. But we seldom text, due to the mega time zone difference. Sometimes, I want to tell him something that made me upset or sad during work, but that will be the time he is sleeping and can't respond to my texts until the next 6-8 hours. As the day dragged on, whatever negative feelings I have dissipated and I no longer feel the urge to tell him. That feeling of loneliness when I know that he isn't quite there for me is real. I also felt we are slowly drifting apart.

I guess he is coping well enough without me by his side, and often when I watched his insta stories he would be at some bar with a bunch of colleagues around him. He seemed really happy,  and sometimes I wonder if I should let go of this relationship since we doesn't seem to be walking in the same path in the future anymore. 

I really don't think I can stay in a LDR, and at the same time I do not want to give up my job with my good friends around too. And I know that it is unfair for me to ask him to come back to Singapore. I love him, and I want the best for him, and whatever makes him happy.

How do you know if the person is right for you?  As you have already mentioned,  both of you share so many things in common. 

Yet,  you do not seem to be satisfied with your partner.  I agree with many of the comments.  Leave her then.

For sure,  there will be someone better than your partner.  The day she gets old,  you will find someone younger and prettier.  Or you will find someone smarter at work. Etc etc

For me,  once i committed myself,  i stopped looking and comparing.  Cos i know that there is always someone out there ""better "".  Who am i to kid?  If i am not the most desirable person on earth,  how do i snag the most desirable person of the opposite sex. So who are you kidding? 

And the next one that comes along may not be as good as you think.  A friend once told me she had 4 boyfriends before she got married.  On hindsight,  her 1st and previous were better.  But there is no turning back

No one is saying you cannot disagree with OP, but a little tact couldn't hurt right?

Guess most of those judgmental people just want to swing their mighty dick of self righteousness around in a pointless display of ""outstanding morals"".  Well sure, you do yours and I'll do mine."

61008,"To the guy in RVRC Tower block lvl 3 who is always singing when bathing, I love your voice. I honestly think you vocals are top-notch and you have the potential to make it big. Please sing more and louder so the whole college can hear your angelic voice.

JK, your voice make me want to bring ear plugs with me to the bathroom."
61007,"As the OP of #61007, i gotta say that it wasnt targeted at the masses who got awards. Just the last two award categories where people who were wholly undeserving got ridiculous awards like ""best RA"". I'm sorry, but you were paid to carry out your job. If you keep giving awards out to any tom harry or dick, it's going to downplay the REAL contributions by members of the college. Members like house heads who stepped up to an unpaid role to bring the house to greater heights. And giving awards to the fitness CCA is extra bullshit cause in that sense you arent recognising other oustanding members from other CCAs. "

Shoutout to Dr Vik from ST2131

We are really sry for picking on ur project presentation. Ur team misinterpreted the qns cuz u all failed to understand the key concept in the module.

We were trained and taught to record and pinpoint every doubt or mistake slide by slide. Sry for making u click to so many said slides. Sry for critizising so many things in Ur presentation. Glad that u all managed to redo the project and submit and pass. 

BTW, I wonder how u pass Ur GP. Don't tackle ur project with political + social + economic approaches. It is economic and not economical. Want economical pls go eat the economical rice...

Thanks to u all, we got an A for this project. Thank You!

61004,Anyone willing to share their experience working in a IT service based company? Is there opportunities for career growth in this sector? Thanks

How do you know if the person is right for you?  As you have already mentioned,  both of you share so many things in common. 

Yet,  you do not seem to be satisfied with your partner.  I agree with many of the comments.  Leave her then.

For sure,  there will be someone better than your partner.  The day she gets old,  you will find someone younger and prettier.  Or you will find someone smarter at work. Etc etc

For me,  once i committed myself,  i stopped looking and comparing.  Cos i know that there is always someone out there ""better "".  Who am i to kid?  If i am not the most desirable person on earth,  how do i snag the most desirable person of the opposite sex. So who are you kidding? 

And the next one that comes along may not be as good as you think.  A friend once told me she had 4 boyfriends before she got married.  On hindsight,  her 1st and previous were better.  But there is no turning back 

Me - since i dont look,  i married my first love.  And had never looked back or look around in your case. 

All the best. Please treasure your partner .  Else, she deserves someone better.  I am also sure there are people out there who are better for her.
