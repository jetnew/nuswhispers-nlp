55398,i agree with #55370 on the last part tho. everytime i hear of someone whos happy and capable who sadly passed i wished it was me instead so that this life can be given to someone who deserves more and better
55397,I leave the exam hall earlier to avoid classmates who would swamp me asking for solutions to the paper.

55395,"#55395: I think I also got scammed by the Fruit and Juice stall at Fine Foods UTown. I bought a $3.50 juice, gave the guy a $5 bill, and got back only $0.7 change. I wasn't paying attention and put the change in my wallet before I realized it's too little. When I asked the guy he just feigned ignorance. I didn't argue further because I wasn't 100% sure and it's not worth the hassle, but now that I see similar stories I will never buy from them again that's for sure."
55394,"Why deadline for module feedback exercise is always before exams start ah???

What's the point...? IMO shouldn't it be set up to exactly 1 week after exams week 2???

Isn't it better to evaluate the whole module after taking the finals paper too?"

55383,"Dear #55365,
As a person who sometimes leaves early, let me share my perspective...

After finishing the paper, I ask myself a very simple question: Will I change anything if I stay? 
If the answer is no, I leave. 
This could be because I am confident that I'm right, or that I know that no matter how much I think, I simply do not know the correct answer

If you have already answered to the best of your ability, there's no ""advantage"" in staying any longer.  In an exam, it's up to you to do your best. It really doesn't matter what your peers are doing.

There's much more to life than exams. Please don't spend your time obsessing over such issues. "

A good educational system should advocate for the advancement of knowledge among mankind (or at least its own students) and not simply celebrate copy-pasting.

55361,"#55284 As a guy, I always go on dates with different girls and chatting with different girls, sometimes up to 10 at one time and I find it perfectly fine all as long as I am still not yet attached, but of course once i become attached, all these nonsense will stop. For a guy, I think this is perfectly normal since we have to be very proactive and always prepare for the worse as you cant guarantee this one girl that you are interested in will be mutually interested in you. Using the same anology, you dont send resume, wait for an interview, interview failed and then send the next one. You send multiple at one go to speed up the process."
55360,"#55320 Still can. You can go to utown or PGPR management office and ask them. I was in a similar situation. They gave me a room in the end (probably because I was in final year. First year and final year students are prioritised). No harm to try anyway.
Staying in campus is way cheaper than outside, unless you're comparing single room (in campus) vs shared room (ourside) or willing to stay far far away. Transportation and utilities (water, electricity, internet) are also free in campus."

55336,Is it possible to file a complaint against the invigilators for an exam? They were like chatting in the venue and the venue is not even that big to begin with -.-
55334,"Referencing to #55284:

Why do people seem to be condemning the OP? I feel like it is alright to go on dates with different people provided that no party involved is exclusively in a relationship with anyone. For me, I see going on dates as trying to figure out if that party's values are aligned to mine, eg said person might have common interests with me but while going on dates and having more interactions I realised that the person has conflicting religious beliefs w me then I won't pursue the relationship further. And I don't think going on dates are ""crossing the boundaries"" if it does not entails ""couply acts"" like holding hands, kissing etc. 

Is it because it seems to be unfair if one party already likes the other and would be very upset if she/he knows that the person is actually going on dates with other people? "
55332,"Sometimes, if not most of the time, I feel that NUS students have such high sense of self entitlement.. like crossing roads without looking out for vehicles, taking their own sweet time sashaying across whilst chit chatting with their friends."
55331,"I like this guy in my course. He's smart and funny and he's rather popular. The only problem is that we're both attached and this being a small cohort, almost everyone knows everyone else.

Compared to my boyfriend he's far more interesting and a better match for me... And I think he could do better than his current girlfriend to say the least.

Now that we've finished our modules for this semester, I'm not sure if I'll see him again in the same tutorial class... I even took special effort to show up to the same tutorials as him as far as that was possible.

I heard that he was medically trained and I thought that he really looked good in uniform when I saw him in my friend's pictures, it just makes him that much more attractive to me...

Everyone says that just cause got goalkeeper doesn't mean cannot score, but how do I go around doing that even?"
55329,"#55268: you know what's the first thing that popped in my head?

This scene from Breaking Bad season 1, episode 7 ""A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"":

[Walter and Jesse are meeting Tuco at a junkyard]

Jesse: A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place?

Walter: What's wrong with it? It's private.

Jesse: This is...This is like a...a non-criminal's idea of a drug meet. This is like, ""Oh, I saw this in a movie. Ooh, look at me.""

Walter: Yeah, so...so where do you transact business? Enlighten me.

Jesse: I don't know. How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza. Nice and public. Open twenty-four hours. Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza. Hell, why not the mall? You know, wait at the Gap. ""Hey! It's time for the meet!"" You know, I'll put down the flat-front khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius. Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco, you know, comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death.

Yeah, tip for everyone meeting someone you have never met in person before: choose a public place with lots of people. If they don't show up, you don't look like an idiot standing in the middle of an empty lot and there are things that you can do at that location anyway. A random person standing around wandering in an empty car park arouses suspicion: a police can show up asking questions."
55323,"I would like to admonish OP of #55323 for trying to think of gaming the system. 
Not sure which major you are in, but if you already know that the mods cannot be S/U-ed, why are you asking this question? Why did you not put in the effort during the semester? There is a reason why the university does not publish what happens if a student fails core modules that cannot be S/U-ed, which is to prevent students from acting smart and thinking they can game the system and get a better grade on their second attempt. What, think you can jump from a Fail grade(whichever ones they are) and get an A grade on the second attempt?"

55321,"My father is an alcoholic and gets very violent when he is drunk. He hits me physically, but he is smart in the sense that he hits me in places where it'll be covered by clothing (e.g. my stomach). I have a stable boyfriend and we've been together for quite some time. He is everything my father is not - gentle, loving and patient. There were many times when we were this close to having sex but I always backed out at the last minute. He always says that it's alright if I'm not ready (and he really means it) but the truth is that I do want to sleep with him. I'm just too afraid that he'll see the bruises all over my body and decide that I'm just not for him. He doesn't know that my dad hits me. In school, I am an overachiever. My friends say that I am on the prettier side and I wouldn't say that I'm lacking in popularity. However, this is all just a facade. At home, I am just the weak girl that can't stand up for myself. My father treats me like a punching bag and I let him. People think I have it all, but beyond the surface, I am a pathetic loser who cannot even fend for myself.

55301,"Hi #55301, OP of #55237 here, just to clarify some things - she's been fangirling over him ever since they met in one of their course mods, and basically gushing about it. I'm not saying that it means anything, but she's been emotionally distant since she met him, and it seems that even though they just met they're abnormally close. I'm not sure about how you see it, but for me it's slightly alarming that they go home together almost every day, and I'm pretty sure that their timetabling can't be so ""zhun"" that they're in the same class for literally everything? Either he shifted his classes around to meet her, or the other way around.

Maybe it's paranoia or just me. But I can't shake the feeling that people don't get so close to each other that fast in under a semester without something going on behind the scenes. I've mentioned that she's been emotionally distant, and that we haven't seen each other much of late since we've been rather busy. But despite the emotionally distant part - she seems to be rather overeager? Like she's emotionally distant, but on occasion it seems like she's trying to make up for something and seems extra nice and stuff. I know that sounds weird, but to put it more clearly, she seems nicer and happier, but less emotionally involved with me? It just seems like she was trying to hide something.

I thought at the time that it could have been just my paranoia too, but the speed at which she got with the other guy was alarming - it was barely a month after we broke up, and I wouldn't say our relationship was on the rocks. I heard she went home with him barely a week after we broke up, and she wasn't the type to jump into bed with just about anyone - for us it took months, so I'm quite sure of some things, I just don't have any evidence. Yeah, I know I'm insecure, but I made it a point not to badger her about her male friends, I only asked cause he kept coming up in conversation.

I've been trying to find evidence of it for some time now, but I can't seem to find anything. I've been stonewalled by her friends and sometimes even by mutual friends, and she doesn't seem to accept follower requests anymore - her social media seems to have gone dead.

I know it's still conjuncture on my part, and I know all of this might just literally be me overthinking, but it's not a good place right now. All of this is hindsight, and I'm not sure of what I'm seeing, so maybe I may have been too accusatory. I'm just confused right now. TBH, all my friends tell me I'm overthinking this, but my head's not listening.

I know it's time to move on, and that maybe I'll never get closure from her, but it's hard I guess...

Anyway finals have ended for me, so it's just me, my thoughts and I again..."
55300,"If you’re thinking of confessing to someone, read this post before you do so. Please at least make sure that y’all are good friends before confessing, chances are even after you’re rejected, it’s still possible to stay friends. Recently I was confessed to by someone in my CCA in hall, it was super awkward because I’ve never even went out with her one-on-one or had deep convos with her personally. Whatever interaction we had was purely only during CCA, it felt more like an infatuation rather than a serious liking. From then on, I couldn’t help but avoid her because it was simply too awkward. I just don’t feel that way towards her and it’ll be weird to become friends AFTER the confession,  it’s like any interaction feels like I’ll be leading her on. So conclusion is seriously don’t confess if y’all aren’t even good friends to begin with, it’s impulsive and you’ll be very sad when the person starts avoiding you (but seriously can’t be helped)"
