60598,"Dear prof Ben, I am curious whether Master Degree is required/very helpful to work in CS related field? (Esp Software Engineering or related). Or it is better to use the time to work and gaining experience instead?"

60595,"In reply to confession about those wearing formal wear looking down on other - It could be just your mindset how do you know what they are thinking just by looking at their face ? In fact people who wear formal are not bosses because let’s just say you saw two person having appointment ,the one wearing informal definitely show some power that they can wear casual and the other person have to wear until so formal to respect someone, so why feel jealous hahahah"
60593,"I’m in year 4 now and I feel exactly the same way I did when I first entered NUS 4 years ago. Happy and naive. 

I have been liking someone for 6 years now. I met him in JC. I know he doesn’t love me back,but so? 

I spend every day in NUS, from year 1 to year 4, stalking him on Instagram and Snapchat. It’s a one sided relationship for 6 years, and I always find excuses to talk to him. Whenever he responds, I feel Super happy. Whenever I talk to him over the phone, my heart swells with joy.

I knew right from the start that he doesn’t feel the same way back, but he DOESNT OWE ME ANYTHING. Loving him one-sided, unconditionally, has become the GREATEST OF ALL JOYS. I don’t expect anything from him in return, yes, for all the 6 years. 

In year 1 and year 2, I have watched with confusion how my friends cried and cried and cried after they were dumped. I told them about this guy whom I love unconditionally without expectations, and they told me that they cried because they follow the basic human nature of being “ selfish”. They said no human isn’t “selfish”, everyone will feel sad if love isn’t returned. Simply because of selfishness.

In year 3, 4 friends came to me and told me straight to my face that I “need help” because I was “weird”. They proceeded on to warn me that I am “not being fair to myself” and I’m supposedly “hurt deep inside”(...????) I don’t understand, which part of it is supposed to hurt? Am I supposed to become selfish too? 

It’s already year 4, I have secured a job offer (company name not disclosed here to remain anonymous) and I’m still in love with that same someone whose smile, whose words, whose social media posts, have kept me warm and happy for the past 6 years, 4 in NUS and 2 in JC. I have rejected every other guy whom I feel can’t even measure up. 

And no, I did not shed a single tear when I think of him.

Sorry, but is there a “reason” why it’s “compulsory” for me to feel sad when it’s unrequited? Is there some “rule” that dictates I have to bawl my eyes out stalking his social media?

If you feel hurt in a one sided relationship, does that mean you’re “selfish”? And if I don’t feel hurt, it means I’m “selfless” and “saint-like”? (I’m not, by the way)

60589,"The National Data Science Competition ended yesterday, and I really want to let this out of my chest. Our team formed months before the start of the competition, with the consensus that we are going to go for the win. But why was it that when the competition finally began, I end up being the only one who was truly invested in it?

You guys said you had no time. Fine, but at least acknowledge my messages, be curious about the things I was working on, right? All I got was just a group chat where I was just talking and updating myself on what I was doing. For the entire, freaking month, I felt like I was just talking to myself. 

I had trust in them. After all, some of them were friends that I knew for quite a while. But that is exactly why, I feel so goddamn betrayed. Just why? Are you all really so devoid of time that you can't even acknowledge my messages? Then why do I see one of you active on the game chat I'm in, playing the same game as I am, while I run the data models and do my work?

Really. I don't like to lead. I don't like to stand on the spotlight. I don't like to be the one engaging everyone. I don't like to put in so much effort only to gain nothing out of it. That's why I usually just stick to the sidelines, making sure that I contribute the amount I need, or go just a step further if necessary. 

I'm tired. I really am. But I can't just stay depressed and lie down on my bed. There are still things that I have to do.

Sigh. I want a break."
60588,"I wish the darkness could just go away. Thoughts about me jumping off the building or stabbing myself keeps coming into my mind. I try to think of happier stuff, or listen to music, but these doesn't seem to work, and those thoughts just keep coming. 

I wish i knew who to turn to. People keep thinking I am weird and most treat me like I don't exist. Please help me. I really don't want to die. I just want the darkness to go away.

60586,"Me again, LDR issue from #60504. Yea, u guys are all right. I confronted with him finally because I found that he secretly delete my photo on his facebook wall. If he was really stressful about his work, how would him worry about the fb photo instead?

60581,"Im sick of all this drama about Orbital. Disclosure that I am a student myself.

A. Yes there are limited seats. That is how programs work. Sign-ups could have been managed better, but limited is limited. 

B. It isn't first-come-first-served. Where do people get this idea? If they even read about Orbital, it explicitly says it prioritizes cs freshies. 

And you know what? This post is more than just about Orbital. It is also about how some modules are discussed here. What really gets to me is a certain entitled mindset. I don't mean to generalize, but it seems to come a lot from younger compsci majors. 

When you don't get something you want, do you first ask yourself ""why didn't I get it?"" and ""what else can I do?"". But instead, some people have a knee jerk reacion of ""I should get everything I want, and if I don't, it is someone else's fault. It is always someone else not catering to me"" and ""If I don't get what I want or I don't like something, I can't engage in polite feedback and discussion. Just change the whole system to fit my individual desires, even if it makes no sense for the whole"".

CS is an awesome major and we really need people studying it. But that doesnt mean the world revolves around you just because you study it. The world does not change orbit just because CS is the hot new thing and just because you got As in your youth. If you give feedback in a way that is weirdly demanding, clearly rude and overly entitled, I expect that it won't be taken seriously. "
60580,"To #60376: I had a similar experience too with one of the UHC psychiatrists during the pre-uni mental health assessment, but can't remember who it was :/ I remember feeling quite shocked by the way she was speaking to me, because aren't psychiatrists supposed to be empathetic, or at the very least fake it? I forgot about it eventually until now because I thought I was just being delusional, but maybe I was wrong. Throughout the whole assessment it felt like she had this unfeigned disgust towards me, like I was wasting her time for being there. For context I already have difficulty talking to counsellors or therapists but when she was asking stuff like ""so what trauma happen to you"" ""why do you have depression"" in this contemptuous way I got even more withdrawn, and  I felt guilty because she was obviously frustrated with me. I know psychiatrists aren't supposed to do a therapist's job and talk through everything but it was such a stark contrast to the psychiatrists I've been with in the hospital. It was so bad to the point that at the end when she asked me to decide whether to transfer from the hospital to UHC for treatment with her it was a straight-up no from me even though going to the UHC would be free and I already have trouble affording to go to the hospital. Maybe if more come forward, something might be done."

You had problem learning cs2100, would like to know if you understand it during the lesson, when the lecturers are explaining? Do you get enough help? I am now worried, if i take an IT course, will it be impossible for me to perform well. Sometimes it is hard when you don't really understand."
60575,"I have the problem of becoming 自作多情 when I have a crush on someone. It is as though my mind is playing tricks on my trying to psycho myself into believing that I have a chance with that person, but in actual fact he probably doesn’t like me at all. 
Usually when a guy jokes around with me, I will just laugh together and maybe just tease him back. But if he is just a friend I wouldn’t think much of the interaction and I definitely wouldn’t feel that the guy likes me or anything. But when it is my crush who teases me, my mind will convince myself that he likes me that’s why he is teasing me. And there is no other reason for his behavior. Also if a guy friend helps me with a favor I will just be thankful and I wouldn’t think much of it. But if my crush helps me i will think that he is helping me because he likes me. I know it sounds ridiculous and I really want to stop this ridiculous shameless. the last time this has happened to me, i was head over heels over the previous crush and my whole mind has already painted images of us together but he kind of sensed it so he just called me bro and I was shaken back to reality. It was really painful to be slapped in the face by reality but I think this is actually good for me. Unfortunately this is happening to me again with another new crush and I really wish to stop...."

60570,"Am I the only one who thinks Prof Chin Chee Whye from the math department is kinda.. hot? He looks pretty good for someone near 50 yrs old, his lectures are superb, and of course he's super smart. Why aren't there guys like him who are of my age anymore =(("
60569,"Some days, I feel helpless. Trapped, perhaps, in the expectations of my community. I feel that I must pursue activities for the sake of grades and portfolio, that I must be looking for internships and courses relevant to my degree, especially since summer's coming.

I know I don't have to, but then what would have been the point of the thousands of dollars spent on my university education? Of all the time, tears and effort it took - more than it should have taken - to finish my A Levels and get here? 

I prided myself on my sense of direction, once. But I pivoted, grew afraid that I wasn't passionate enough, wasn't cut out for it or that what I wanted didn't have a future in Singapore. ""You've got your As,"" people told me, or maybe I told myself that too. ""You came from a great school. You're here, by virtue of hard work and privilege. Why throw it all away for something you're not even certain about?""

So I made my decision. Chose a course I was fairly interested in and hardly cared for, but it was safe. For months I was convinced it was fine. Today I finally let myself think about what could have been, what my future now might be. Is it presumptuous to ponder over that from my position in the present? No idea, but those thoughts creep into my head all the same.

""It's never too late to change,"" people tell me that too, as do I. But I have to muster up the courage first.

And I have never liked admitting it, but ever since I received my A Level grades and was struck with the possibility of following what I thought had been my dreams, I have been nothing but cowardly."
60567,Admins please don't censor this. Year 4 CNM student. Received an email from CNM for full-time TA position. Now wait. I thought the HOD promised bringing in high quality lecturers after profs left. How is recruiting us without work ex or industry high quality? Concerned about the Department.
60566,I dont get why students in faculty of science dont get to take DSA modules even though we pay the same sch fees as them. Why so exclusive??

60564,"I thought orbital was supposed to be first come first serve. I signed up at 5pm++ and still didnt get it. Probably because the cs freshies were making so much noise that prof ben had to step in. This is so unfair to those who actually abided by the registration timing but arent cs freshies. There are also other students from other faculties that are interested in doing computing projects but because of entitled y1 cs students that didnt sign up on time making so much noise, we get sidelined. And i thought NUS is a proponent for interdisciplinary learning. Guess you don't actually have to abide by registration rules if you can call your faculty profs to fix your mistakes."

It deprives those who actually want to hold meetings in the rooms the chance to use them. Especially when the rooms are booked and occupied by them or their items. Worse still, these people book the room when they are not even using the room or treat it as if it's their home by either leaving alot of things inside, sometimes overnight."
