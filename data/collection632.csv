63299,"Hello, after the recent finals, it seems that there is a gap between what people think of Uni life vs what Uni life actually is like. What are the cold hard truths about Uni that people should know? Especially to prospective students."
63298,"Hi everyone I’m the OP of #63298 and I really appreciate all the educated debates. I’m back with a new topic. 

I finished serving my national service a few years ago and the lack of manpower back then was already terrible. With falling birthrates, manpower for NS will decrease and there won’t be enough people to protect Singapore. So why not let the women serve NS as well? 

Back in the days, men were chosen to serve the army because wars required the physically strong to fight the wars. However as times are changing, wars are increasing fought with a touch of a button to launch cyber attacks or missiles. Wars now are no longer about fighting on the grounds. 

So why shouldn’t women serve the army as well? Countries like Norway, Israel and Sweden have mandatory national service for both genders. Are we trying to imply that independent Singaporean women are not capable of doing some admin work, devise strategies, and protect the country? There are PES E guys with major health conditions who are far weaker physically than the average women but still need to serve the army. So why shouldn’t we send women to the army as well? NS can help them grow as a person and teach them life skills too. 

Women now have more and more rights. But with more rights come more responsibilities. It’s 2019 and all about equality now too. It’s unfair if a women chooses to serve the army and gets paid $2k+ per month while guys have no choice but to serve and get paid $560 per month. In order to better protect Singapore, we need all the help we can get."
63297,"Im curious if people here would date or spend the rest of your life with someone with epilepsy? You would have to deal with their mood swings, seizure at any moment, taking extreme care of them when they are unwell, spending tons of money on their medication and other future circumstances that may come"
63296,"I used to date this guy for a few months. Thinking back, i don’t know what i ever saw in him. He was vindictive and bear grudges for years, kept emphasizing how he expects the girl to “give” in a relationship (eg paying / planning dates), complains everything we have argued about to his friends, and just shift between emotionally so cold or easily angered over things. In all honesty, i’m finding it really difficult to state any redeemable quality about him at all (not even the superficial aspects), and i’ve never felt so badly treated by a person in my life. 

All i can say is that i’m glad that part of my life is over, and now i’ve found someone who has been the complete opposite of him - unconditionally loving, patient, easygoing and uncalculative. I must have saved a whole kingdom in my previous life because i feel so lucky to be able to meet someone like him :)

To others out there that are feeling miserably treated in your current relationship, my advice is to see objectively whether the relationship is worth salvaging or if you’re just holding onto it due to sentimental value / fear of being alone / delusion that it’ll get better. Here’s hoping that everyone will be able to find that special someone that will make you feel happier by the day soon :)"
63293,"Y1 in Engineering here. When I graduate and start work next time, I aim to be in management by age 30. I'm interested in working in something business related, not technical roles. I don't have any preference for industry type but I don't want to work extended periods overseas. The reason I want to be in management is to get the high salary and the prestige. What are the courses I should take and anything I can do to work towards my goal? Is my motivation to be in management correct?"
63292,"I have graduated from nus 2 years ago and have been ever since. 
I have this colleague who was also from my course/batch, who I had absolutely no feelings for through out uni life and the many months of work.

But very recently my god damn heart started to develop feelings for her and soon enough I was thinking about her during most of my waking hours. And the worst was whenever I ran into her she would say ""hey buddy/friend"", even though I heard her saying this to most other Co workers, but still it really sucks to hear the word friend. It's as if the word friend is strongly stressed for me.

 I've thought of being honest with my feelings but I am quite settled in this bank and wouldn't want to jump ship. Totally lost about what should I do."
63291,"Not gonna lie, I enjoyed CS1010S so much but the exams are so atrocious. I don’t think I have achieved mastery for Python for sure, but it’s ridiculous when one can do all the questions for mid-term and final but ends up with lousy marks because the questions are not phrased properly and blame is placed on students for not understanding the questions properly.

I appreciate the effort to shake things up by introducing new questions, but I really hope that for the future batches, the profs can give questions that are easier to understand. At the end of the day, we should be tested on our programming skills, not our reading ability."
63288,"Think about it: If you’re with a guy and you’re still going dutch, isn’t that more like friends and not a relationship? Basically what I can say is that if a girl is willing to pay most of the time, then you’re in it for a lucky one. She definitely loves you. But my boyfriend pays for everything most of the time even when I offer, he rejects."
63287,"Regarding some discussion over ""who pays what"" in a typical date, I'll just offer my own experiences (as a guy). 

I have been together with my gf for nearly 2 years. Whenever we go out on a date (once to a few times a week), I will offer to pay for the meal, if the meal is on the more expensive side and I know that my gf is currently paying for her own driving lessons + other commitments and does not have too much money to spare. When we eat in food court or fast food, we usually go dutch. I don't go in with the expectation that I have to split evenly with her, or even expect her to treat me, because I feel that it is a very petty and ungentlemanly thing to do. When she offers to treat me, it is a bonus. When she offers to pay for dessert, it is a bonus. I mean, if I get pissed and guilt-trip her to pay, it won’t be done out of sincerity, and what do I stand to gain from that? It’s just going to sour the relationship.

When we go out shopping and she sees something she likes, I will offer to buy it for her, or I will remember and purchase it for her the next time we meet. Similarly, she does the same to me too, and I feel that this is an important basis for a healthy relationship. Don’t haggle over who pays more, don’t keep complaining over “over-paying” and wanting the girlfriend to contribute. I believe that as long as there is some sort of coercion within anything related to money, it will only worsen the relationship and potentially snowball. Be understanding, be respectful and be gracious. If your girlfriend is someone with decent values, she will be grateful, even if she does not say it. The small things she does for you after that, such as offering to pay for some small stuff, buying things she knows you like, are signs of reciprocation. 

Reciprocation does not mean “a dollar for a dollar”. I’ve seen other guys who are very calculative with their other half – creating spreadsheets, telling the girlfriend passive-aggressive things like “You know, I paid for our last meal, how about this meal?”, or just saying things with a subtle guilt-tripping overtone. 

Instead, one should not even worry about the calculation of reciprocation in a relationship. It will come naturally, it will manifest itself in other areas subtly, and it will be the bridge that supports a relationship and keeps it alive. A healthy relationship does not inspect the fine bricks of this bridge; instead, only the two of us are aware of such a presence and stabilize it with our own ways, unbeknownst to others. Don’t compare to other couples – If you are happy with your other half, why change it? And if you are not, are you expecting your partner to do something that you yourself are not even willing to do for him/her?

As a guy, when I have a girlfriend, I enjoy the happiness and experiences that I can get to go through together with her. You can think of it as paying for these happy and valuable experiences. If you get something back in return (be it tangible money, items, dessert, or intangible expressions of love), it’s a bonus! And you are very likely to get those things in return, as long as you yourself are very willing to contribute in the first place. If you pay begrudgingly, while guilt-tripping your girlfriend to no end about how you are paying more than her, she’s not going to magically start wanting to pay for you. 

Of course, all couples are different. I’m not going to generalize by saying that this works for every couple. But the mentality is important – communication is key, and being passive-aggressive is NOT a form of communication. Don’t expect him/her to do something for you if you are not even willing to do it first. Lastly, be a gentleman and don’t be overly calculative – you don’t get an appreciative girlfriend by doing that. You get appreciated if you’re willing to do things for her without having the need to constantly announce it. She will know what you are doing, even if she does not mention it verbally. But through her actions, there will be reciprocation in other means, if she’s a decent girl with a decent set of values."

63283,"After working for 5 years after graduation, i am still feeling lost in my career. Any advise what should I do about it?"
63281,"To #63175 and #63218: I would like to share my experience with u guys. So I have just graduated, and met my ex in JC and we were together after A levels for quite a while, for 4 years until uni year 2. Similar to u guys she had the same problem, unrealistic expectations and expecting me to pay. Now don't get me wrong, who doesn't like to treat their girl? But I like to be the one to offer. But it became obvious that it went from being a treat to an obligation. Now before, I continue, I acknowledge this is only my side of the story, and I am just sharing my view point. If anyone is offended by this, I apologise in advance, but please don’t be too angry, it is just my story.

There were countless times where the red flags continuously showed. From her getting upset at me for not buying her flowers, even though our date was at a classy restaurant (and I’m paying), to her complaining about not receiving gifts (again even though I’m paying). She often compared me to other guys she saw on Instagram saying “this guy did this for his gf…etc.”. She was also incredibly high maintenance, she expected me to listen to her every problem, no matter how childish they were, but she never bothered to care about my problems. Ironically, she often gave that ""roll eye"" look and said I was not being a ""man"" when I talked about my problems. Also, she used sex and intimacy to control the relationship and expected me to share my bank PIN with her because it was a “sign of trust.”

Sounds familiar? But deep down, I always closed one eye, because I felt that she gave me “support” and brought “joy” to my life. We were together for 4 years, and I thought she was definitely the one I would marry. Hence when her family was going through financial difficulty, I paid for every date, because I believe that it was “us” against the world.

But I can guarantee you one thing, I was definitely and always be wrong. Remove the intimacy from the relationship, and my ex had nothing to offer. She was someone who wanted things, but doesn’t want to work for it nor does she even bother to try. The only reason she did things for other is because she expected others to do the same for her. The whole relationship was me being blinded by love.

Eventually towards the end of 4 years, I really questioned myself and realized that this was not the partner I want nor will I ever want. And we broke up, it was kind of a rushed breakup, but it was because I really had enough. I wasn’t sad when we broke up, for some reason I felt really relieved.

I do admit I do miss her from time to time, but I know what I missed were the memories, not the person.

This is the advice I can give you both: a relationship is not a feeling, it is not love, it is a commitment. After all, our bank accounts are not unlimited, if your partner fails to realise that and insist that you paying is a “sign” of love, please, don’t be blinded by love. While people were saving, my bank account decreased greatly during those 4 years, and I have nothing to show for it after spending that much.

Trust me, if anyone out here is in a relationship and asking yourself this question: “Why am I paying all the time?” or you notice yourself spending less on other things just so you can keep up with spending in your relationship. Recognize that no matter how good your partner may seem, it is a recipe for failure in the long term, especially if you plan on living forever with that person.

Fast forward to today, I graduated from NUS and I am still single. But during the last 2 years of my uni life, I was free and I worked on myself. I was able to do all the things I was unable to do and improve myself greatly. Going to the gym and learning new hobbies. 

Eventually I would want to date someone else, but for now, I want to improve me first!

Remember, the first step to loving someone is to be able to love yourself first. If you have to sacrifice loving yourself and your own happiness to love someone else, you are not in love, you are in a dream, and you better wake up. If your wants are causing a problem in a relationship. Please wake up too and go and run 10 rounds around the parade square. For me, I knew it was a problem because I wanted to save for our future, but she wanted to spend it all because “we are young only once.”

Our society has trained us to be materialistic, and is often hard to find partners who do not compare, partners who look on Instagram and see other boyfriends and be jealous. It is not their fault, this is the effect of social media.
For those who have loving partners, partners who tell you they want to eat cheap to help you save money, the partners who sit down and listen to even your smallest problems, and never condescend you, the partners who you know will never let their wants get in the way or cause problems in the relationship. Please, hold them close, and tell them everyday that you love them. Because they are indeed a rare breed that will only get rarer.
Best of luck!"

63275,"Is glassdoor reviews reliable? I was prepared to join company A which had quite a positive working culture (as mentioned by glassdoor) when I just received a call from company B which offers a higher pay and it is a company that I wanted to join at the start. However, the reviews at glassdoor seem to reflect poorly on that company. Any advice?"
63274,"I have a problem. There are about currently 2-3 guys that i am texting daily and I can vaguely (is actually a little obvious) tell that are interested in me.  I have gone out with one of them for a dinner because I wanted to give him a chance but now, I still feel like I’m not ready to commit or to settle down. How do I voice it out? Without hurting his feelings?"
63273,"I am currently an engineering student and we all know that engineering isn't the easiest or the most relaxing course ever. However, despite the complexity of the course in general and the workload, it makes me wonder if everything I'm doing now is worthy or will even land me a proper, stable job in the future. To be honest, I always ask myself if it is too late to jump onto the finance and banking industry bandwagon because like most people said, that's where the money roll (literally, too).

In Singapore, it is almost undeniable that the engineering sector isn't the brightest or most prosperous sector to be in. You can't go far in engineering, and when you reach a ripe age in engineering, you'll be expendable and easily replaced with much younger candidates with a fresh and updated set of skills and knowledge because no employer wants to continue paying someone with dated knowledge and skills a higher salary right. When you tell people that you're an engineer in Singapore, their shallow minds will instantaneously link you to being clad in a factory overall stained with black oil working your head off in Jurong Island or Changi area. However, an American friend I met recently was extremely amazed that I was studying Engineering and had nothing but words of praises and respect for me because according to him, if you're an engineer in the States, you're definitely going to make it big. Whereas the banking and finance industry there doesn't provide massive opportunities, which is the opposite of Singapore.

I have a relative who graduated from engineering many years ago, jumped into the banking industry straight after graduation and landed himself a job in one of the banks here as a bank teller. However, he rose up the ranks very quickly it was almost unbelievable. By 30, he was already a millionaire who owned a condominium apartment and bought himself a Porsche, apart from a BMW for his parents. People around him were speculating on his success, and the salty ones were just there saying ""Aiya confirm por (what we all know as 'angkat bola') the boss one lah, por por por until drive PORsche"" but personally, I was just very intrigued by how he attained that success in such a short time, especially having ZERO banking background at all and coming from an engineering course. Was it because he really bootlicked his way up? Because he received tips about the stock market? Because he knew his way around stuff? I never knew, I never dared to ask. One thing's for sure, it did spark a lot of interest towards the finance and banking sector, though I also do know of people who tried for that shortcut to success, only to be destroyed by the stress and demands of their jobs. Like my father said, banking isn't for everyone.

Thus, I just hope to gain some serious advice on what I should do. Should I try my luck at the much coveted 'shortcut to success' or just stick to my engineering roots and give a try first, before deciding if it really is for me? I honestly do not know much about the engineering sector or the banking sector in Singapore myself, just basing everything through hearsay.

P/S: I've taken a look at the Salary Guide in Singapore for 2019, and it was extremely saddening to see the stark difference between the banking & finance, and engineering. Almost none of the engineering jobs listed provide a range of salaries which have 5 digits nor a working experience of 10 years (showing how long an average person lasts in the industry).."

63265,"i need you guys' help/opinions. 

i've been applying for so many jobs but have only heard back from 3, where one of them is a 2.5 year training programme. I have an offer from them but it pays only 1500 throughout the 2.5 years with opportunity to earn up to 2.2k.

63264,"Been seeing a lot of confessions regarding if girls should pay. Here is my two cents.

Honestly, my bf has been paying for most of our dates, I do offer to pay once in awhile but the ratio is about 90/10? More often than not, he would reject if I offer to pay for the both of us or even for going dutch.

All of my online shopping apps are tied to his credit card and he allows me to spend and buy without having to inform him. When we do grocery shopping together, he will offer to pay. Basically, if I am out with him, I will never have to take out my wallet and he has never complain a word. There are so many more aspects in a relationship besides the monetary issue and if you keep harping on $$, you're gonna miss out a lot of other aspects because you are focusing only at what you give and not appreciating what you take.

If you are unwilling to pay for your gf, you're just being selfish. Not saying that if you don't pay for your gf then you don't love her, but it definitely means that you love yourself more than you love her. For those saying what if the gf break up with you, I just have to say that love is like an investment, there is high risk with high returns. If you don't trust her, then don't even begin the rs with her."

63259,"Given the prevalent outsourcing culture in the IT sector in Singapore presently and the current hype of students interested in studying SoC, what is going to happen to those graduates when they finish their degree? To be honest, as an engineer turned SWE for 3 years, I still get the heavy perception that I am being treated like a cost centre by my client. Same goes to those working in in-house shops, where managers expect you to work overtime and deliver high quality solutions else they will start finger pointing / threaten to outsource you to third world countries. Similarly when it comes to AI/ML hype, I faced a lot of resistance to change, nobody buys it and believes it will improve their business but the MNC product managers have cash to burn and they start doleing out cash to vendors to do up a POC so that they can 'justify' analytics is happening in their company. This becomes a running joke to all those poor DAs/BAs who sat through 4-5 rounds of interviews believing the hype but then realize that their role has no meaningful impact more towards doing data laundry service for the company. Why I am sharing this is because I am genuinely worried how the professors going to manage the students expectations when they graduate and join the workforce. Are they going to persist and sell that lie to the students?"
63258,"Recently i reconnected with someone whom i had a crush on while i was year2. He was year1, now end of year3. I dropped some really big hints but i was kind of rejected.

Now, i'm really doubting myself if i should take a chance to set a date. I really do fancy this person though."
63256,"Admins please don't censor, I really need advice here. I recently found out that one of my close friends is working part-time as a professional dominatrix (pro-domme). She has been doing for almost half a year, and is considering making it her full time job and even giving up honours year for it? How do I convince her this is a bad idea?

I don't know how she even 'got started' doing it, but she says it's a much higher paying job than possible for fresh grads with our degree. She once got $600 for 30 mins, and says she averages $200-300 per hour otherwise, which is a lot of money for us. She even has some guys buying her things from her Amazon wishlist weekly. I can understand the lure of money, but I don't think it'll last, especially when she gets older, and it's definitely not worth giving up an office job now.

Also, I'm worried because she's denying that it's sex work (not that I think sex work is inherently bad). She says that there's no actual sex or even full nudity, but she dresses up in fetish outfits and handles guys' genitals so it's really splitting hairs at this point. This is more worrying because she actually looks down on sex work and thinks prostitutes can't get a real job. I'm afraid that one day she's going to realise that what she does isn't different from what they do and have a mental breakdown over it.

So I really need help to think of how to convince her to quit. The most difficult part is that she thinks it's empowering in a feminist sort of way, and while I think it is feminist to do sex work proudly, she absolutely does not think that way and only sees it as empowering because it reverses the gender dynamic."
63255,"I’m a guy and I want a virgin girlfriend. Whenever I said that to people (especially girls), they will criticize me for all sort of things. They will say things like I’m superficial, why am I so ancient, why am i so sexist, questioning confrontationly on whether im virgin or not (yes I am) . It really amazes me that girls become so defensive about this issue. sit’s not just one or two girls, it’s a lot of them, especially Singaporean girls! 

I don’t know why but somehow it’s becoming offensive to even desire virgin girls. The reaction is worse than like say I prefer slim girl, or long hair, or firm boob. 

I don’t know why girls are so defensive over this issue. Is it because most girls are not virgin? Even if you are not, why are you so angry at people who prefer virgin and insist they change their attitude? And if i don’t, they will call me sexist, not open minded or oppressing female sexuality. Why isn’t there oppression of obesity, or oppression of short hair? 

I really don’t get the aggression and criticism... what right do you have to criticizes my preference?"
63253,"Hi, I'm the OP of #63185. First off, would like to thank everyone for their input and opinions. The percentages are not calculated from criteria per se (hell no how does one even properly quantify feelings - I definitely do not go around grading people) it is just to give a better gauge/visualisation. Just like how food is rated (bad analogy I know but hey). Thanks for the link to Ted, realised that is what I have actually been doing (feeling things out) which resulted in that miss while I was deliberating whether to make a move (group/clique/cohort dynamics really did not help, some of you might think that's just an excuse but it just was not a priority in that moment, potentially trashing a few friendships while trying to sort uni life out you know). I do agree it is a HUUUGE waste (curse myself sometimes) but given the circumstances I wouldn't say it was necessarily the wrong logical decision at that point in time (I cannot see parallel universes after all, and we are still rather close friends so I'll take that). And a miss is a miss so no point crying over spilt milk (and beating me over it I beat myself over it [sometimes] enough I should think), just trying to figure out how to move on from here on!"

63245,"Are there girls out there who do not look forward to holding a wedding ceremony?

I have a bf but we are nowhere near discussions about marriage yet - though I definitely want to get married, someday. It's just that since I was young I never dreamed about having an extravagant wedding ceremony and walking down the aisle in a white dress, like many other girls do. To me, a small family gathering for ROM and maybe a set of photoshoot would suffice. Having to ""entertain"" relatives and friends at a banquet (""Chinese style"" and I am not religious so there's no specific religious procedure to go through) to me is like merely ""for show"" and a waste of money (I would rather spend that on honeymoon). 

So I am just curious what are your thoughts on someone who gets married but doesn't want a wedding? Do you think it will disappoint my parents or maybe my relatives would say stuff about it? (I'm the only child btw). To guys - what will your reaction be if your gf thinks this way?"

63241,"Hey OP of #63203 I thought I was the only one having to tolerate all these nonsense in exchange. To all my juniors and friends going for exchange next sem, unless you have zero pet peeves and you are a super easy going and doesn't mind getting taken advantage of, you better find someone with a similar budget and interest that you can live with for the next 4-6 months. My roommate is really one of a kind. Looked like a decent human being from the outside, sounded polite and demure but you get to see her true self after living together for a semester. Selfish, self-entitled, oblivious just to name a few. Can you imagine someone who splurges their parents' money like their own in Singapore, but bickers with you over pennies and cents overseas, using their parents as an excuse? Hypocrite indeed. Saving on necessities such as a public transport pass only to splurge it on high-end cafes and michelin-starred restaurants.

Two more of us arrive at the table, so that makes 5 of us, all colleagues, plus this guy. We do some normal conversation. All of a sudden this guy sits up and shouts ""i was seating here first! I didn't want to have lunch with you! I was seating here first!"" and leaves. There are good 4-5 second where we stay silent and try to digest what just happened, then jokes start, with one of my colleague (and also friend) pointing out that this is the usual mechanism which usually triggers wars. Nobody did anything wrong, but someone somehow felt a pressure situation and melted down. I felt quite sorry for him, but what was he pretending? He lost an occasion to do some conversation, if he wanted to enjoy his coffe alone, there where tens of other seats, benches, couches! Why occupying a table for 6 at peak hours? (and yeah, he wasn't choping). Still, i feel sorry for him."

63229,"hi! any tips on how to ask profs for sealed referral letter? i graduated 4 years ago and only now decided to pursue further studies. I haven’t really been in contact with any of my professors since graduation:( I’m sure my thesis supervisor would remember me at least but they’ve moved to a different county so a sealed letter would be tricky. :/ 

any advice please?"
63227,"dear poster of #63208, it doesn't matter what your degree is when you sign on, it matters more that you need to know more soft skills, such as management, planning skills etc. on top of that, constantly exercising and being fit helps for IPPT. 

hope this helps in choosing modules & majors"
63226,"Recently, I matched up with a guy on a dating app. However, we have not met in person yet. We text each other on a daily basis throughout the day, and especially for a few hours at night. He has told me that he loves my personality. However, he is unable to accept the way I look. I am rather confused. Is he interested in me or is he not?

Also, does looks actually supersede personality?"

63218,"To #63175 and #63218: I would like to share my experience with u guys. So I have just graduated, and met my ex in JC and we were together after A levels for quite a while, for 4 years until uni year 2. Similar to u guys she had the same problem, unrealistic expectations and expecting me to pay. Now don't get me wrong, who doesn't like to treat their girl? But I like to be the one to offer. But it became obvious that it went from being a treat to an obligation. Now before, I continue, I acknowledge this is only my side of the story, and I am just sharing my view point. If anyone is offended by this, I apologise in advance, but please don’t be too angry, it is just my story.

There were countless times where the red flags continuously showed. From her getting upset at me for not buying her flowers, even though our date was at a classy restaurant (and I’m paying), to her complaining about not receiving gifts (again even though I’m paying). She often compared me to other guys she saw on Instagram saying “this guy did this for his gf…etc.”. She was also incredibly high maintenance, she expected me to listen to her every problem, no matter how childish they were, but she never bothered to care about my problems. Ironically, she often gave that ""roll eye"" look and said I was not being a ""man"" when I talked about my problems. Also, she used sex and intimacy to control the relationship and expected me to share my bank PIN with her because it was a “sign of trust.”

Sounds familiar? But deep down, I always closed one eye, because I felt that she gave me “support” and brought “joy” to my life. We were together for 4 years, and I thought she was definitely the one I would marry. Hence when her family was going through financial difficulty, I paid for every date, because I believe that it was “us” against the world.

But I can guarantee you one thing, I was definitely and always be wrong. Remove the intimacy from the relationship, and my ex had nothing to offer. She was someone who wanted things, but doesn’t want to work for it nor does she even bother to try. The only reason she did things for other is because she expected others to do the same for her. The whole relationship was me being blinded by love.

Eventually towards the end of 4 years, I really questioned myself and realized that this was not the partner I want nor will I ever want. And we broke up, it was kind of a rushed breakup, but it was because I really had enough. I wasn’t sad when we broke up, for some reason I felt really relieved.

I do admit I do miss her from time to time, but I know what I missed were the memories, not the person.

This is the advice I can give you both: a relationship is not a feeling, it is not love, it is a commitment. After all, our bank accounts are not unlimited, if your partner fails to realise that and insist that you paying is a “sign” of love, please, don’t be blinded by love. While people were saving, my bank account decreased greatly during those 4 years, and I have nothing to show for it after spending that much.

Trust me, if anyone out here is in a relationship and asking yourself this question: “Why am I paying all the time?” or you notice yourself spending less on other things just so you can keep up with spending in your relationship. Recognize that no matter how good your partner may seem, it is a recipe for failure in the long term, especially if you plan on living forever with that person.

Fast forward to today, I graduated from NUS and I am still single. But during the last 2 years of my uni life, I was free and I worked on myself. I was able to do all the things I was unable to do and improve myself greatly. Going to the gym and learning new hobbies. 

Eventually I would want to date someone else, but for now, I want to improve me first!

Remember, the first step to loving someone is to be able to love yourself first. If you have to sacrifice loving yourself and your own happiness to love someone else, you are not in love, you are in a dream, and you better wake up. If your wants are causing a problem in a relationship. Please wake up too and go and run 10 rounds around the parade square. For me, I knew it was a problem because I wanted to save for our future, but she wanted to spend it all because “we are young only once.”

Our society has trained us to be materialistic, and is often hard to find partners who do not compare, partners who look on Instagram and see other boyfriends and be jealous. It is not their fault, this is the effect of social media.
For those who have loving partners, partners who tell you they want to eat cheap to help you save money, the partners who sit down and listen to even your smallest problems, and never condescend you, the partners who you know will never let their wants get in the way or cause problems in the relationship. Please, hold them close, and tell them everyday that you love them. Because they are indeed a rare breed that will only get rarer.
Best of luck!"

In that case, what will happen if one has more than 160MCs? How can they select which modules to include towards the CAP?

I really want to improve myself and feel more confident about myself. He always reassures me that he will be with me.

63203,"Hey OP of #63203 I thought I was the only one having to tolerate all these nonsense in exchange. To all my juniors and friends going for exchange next sem, unless you have zero pet peeves and you are a super easy going and doesn't mind getting taken advantage of, you better find someone with a similar budget and interest that you can live with for the next 4-6 months. My roommate is really one of a kind. Looked like a decent human being from the outside, sounded polite and demure but you get to see her true self after living together for a semester. Selfish, self-entitled, oblivious just to name a few. Can you imagine someone who splurges their parents' money like their own in Singapore, but bickers with you over pennies and cents overseas, using their parents as an excuse? Hypocrite indeed. Saving on necessities such as a public transport pass only to splurge it on high-end cafes and michelin-starred restaurants.

Having that said, please do not be afraid to embark on a student exchange. It is really an adventure of a lifetime. Those bad times and experiences you had with your ""friends"" teaches you to appreciate the little things in life and make you realize those who truly matter."
63202,"Hi, I’m the OP of #63161. Thanks for leaving your comments. My friend and I met up and talked it through. Maybe I should have set some context. My friend and I are both gay, we have no romantic feelings for the other (as far as I know) and are just merely best friends. I apologised to him for using that language. Then, I sought for clarification on why he thinks I’m not a good friend. Again, he brought up the same two reasons: I don’t text him first and I am not often the one who initiates the plan to meet up with him. He said that he feels anxious when people don’t reply him and he doesn’t quite know how to follow-up in the event that I don’t respond to his messages. I am aware he’s dealing with anxiety issues and to that point, I said that I would be fine if he wanted to prompt me for a reply. I would not feel imposed.

When he was finished with his part, I explained to him why I reacted in such a manner and why I thought his words were unfair. On the first reason, I told him that I am not the sort to text or respond immediately. I look at the urgency of a message, and I respond accordingly. Sometimes that takes a few hours; other times, I reply immediately. In every instance I’ve responded to him, I’ve replied enthusiastically. I don’t write monosyllable answers. I take time to craft a thoughtful response complete with emojis and gifs. He felt that I responded too slowly; to that point, I agreed but said that that is not something I will change or give in to him. I emphasised that if it was something urgent, he can call me directly and I will make the time for him. 

On the second reason, I agreed that I could take more initiative to plan meetups with him. I confessed to sometimes relying on him to plan things for us.  This is something I will work on. Everything is well now between me and my friend. 

Final point, I wanted to respond to a comment left in my earlier confession. Someone said that a person who doesn’t care about texts they get is not someone worth showing respect. I wonder how the hell you would have survived in an age prior to any forms of messaging technologies. I completely disagree with you and think it’s utter bullshit to expect someone to respond to texts they get. I don’t live my life on my phone. So if I think your message is non-urgent and you are not my close friend, I sure as hell am not going to respond to you. We like to think we’re the centre of the universe in our friends’ lives, but that’s not the case and it shouldn’t be. If you want your friend’s attention, text/call and ask him or her for a meetup. Catch up over a meal or coffee. The best conversations are done face-to-face and not over texts. But you know what? You do you. I'll do me.

To Megan, your comment was the most helpful. You reminded me to approach the subject gently; because I know my friend is going through anxiety issues and I didn't want to hurt him. Thank you."
