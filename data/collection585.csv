58595,"It started off with you approaching me to make friends. At times, we hit off well. At times, we did not have much to talk about. The times when you got on my nerves because of how insensitive you are, I displayed my annoyance. As time passed the brick of wall between us thickened. Whenever either of us tries to break the wall, one of us would not be in the mood. You have found your group of friends now. Sometimes, I wish it would not have been this way. "
58592,"I don't understand one thing about girls (on dating apps). I get a lot of matches on Tinder. This keeps me hoping that I'll get to know the person because the next step is to chat.

But there's this thing that girls don't even reply back (not even a single message). I start off pretty nicely (not the most funny ice breaker but not as boring as a hi). They just don't reply back. If you didn't want to talk, why did you swipe right?

On Bumble, I get matches but many of them don't even make a move to start off the conversation (I guess they just want to be confident and happy that there are guys interested in her)."
58591,I saw a previous post where someone was questioning why people want to have kids. I tell people that I don't want to have kids. What I have not told anyone is that I am infertile. Not even my family knows. Being stigmatised for saying that I do not want kids is the lesser evil compared to being stigmatised for being infertile. Why do people think that women only exist to serve the purpose of having kids? I thought people would be more progressive in the 21st century. 
58587,"I always thought it’s pointless for the jc vs poly debate. I thought it’s wrong and “racist” to judge people by their school. But some recent experience has caused me to have a second thought. 

I always study at a certain library. Nowadays it’s suddenly packed with a lot poly kids because it’s poly exam seasons. I’m totally fine with it. 

I never had any problems with jc and uni kids. We are all busy studying and minding our own business. For example, when I sat beside an RJC couple a few days ago, they didn’t even twitch an eyebrow on me. They were so serious and earnest in studying that I felt inspired and enlightened by the atmosphere alone. 

However, some, some of the poly kids really behave like gangsters in the library. They are aggressive and self-centered. They think that they own the library, they deserve more rights just because they come in gangs, they outnumber others. Their ego get hurt easily even when you never intended to do anything with them. They like to interpret others’ actions negatively. They seem to focus on the wrong things, such as wanting to create a conflict with a stranger out of nothing. Do you come to library to do your exam revision or anything else? 

I used to have this naive thinking that poly kids are more fun and open than jc kids. Now I see the opposite. These poly gangs can be even more exclusive than your jc cliques. Basically anyone outside of their gang is their enemy. 

This is not a troll or stirring post. I’ve met nice poly people too. I’m only referring to some, some, some of them.

58580,"To #58536:

I am in the same situation as you. I am giving myself 6-12 months to find a relevant job of my major. I was from poly too so I am much older (That's seems to be a disadvantage too).

But I always remembered a friend from poly. He was 25 when he started poly (came after ITE & NS). I once asked him, ""Aren't you scared that by the time you graduate from poly, you might be too old for uni or even a career?"" I am from STEM and you know to advance in a science career you generally required a PHD in the long run. 

But then he answered, ""This is Singapore. No matter how old you are, as long as you want to work, you can survive. Wouldn't get rich, but definitely can survive."" Then he proceeded to calculate how much money he needs to survive a month (Just 30 days of hawker food and drinks, allowances for parents, internet and games); guess what? The amount to survive isn't much. Maybe it isn't a way to live, but coming from a poor family, it wasn't all that unfamiliar. Isn't it?

With that as the downside, I am not too afraid of the future. "

But somehow the people in charge are afraid of this type of people I feel, if he complain about this, they will change this. instead of telling him to stop making so much noise they are afraid of him and giving in to whatever he says. What is wrong with this world"

58566,"To #58566, 

I have the same problem. It's easier for me to build positive relationships with cats than with humans. It's especially difficult in school. People who are better than me don't want to befriend with ""trash"" like me. People who are worse than me also stay away from me. People of my similar standard can be too competitive and jealousy to be my real friends. 

""I can tell that they are bored with me and uninterested in me. I know that people would rather talk to someone else than me.""

Yes, this applies to me too. Even when I make the initiative to strike up a conversation, they just respond passively to die down the talk. 

I realize that I'm just an outsider, a marginalized person. I'm not an insider cool kid. 

I can only accept it and just do my own thing.

58565,"Disclaimer: this is not to trivialise the OP of #58462;

Saw several comments about how OP could be lucky in some sense. I'm not sure if they fully understood the situation. As a fellow suffer of similar conditions, I thought I should put this out. For people who are unfamiliar, perhaps you can consider watching the HIMYM episode where Robin discovered that she was infertile to get a glimpse of what it's like. 

I suffer from something similar. I was a party girl for some years of my life. ( My infertility had nothing to do with my partying or sexual behaviour. Signs of infertility was already showing way before I was sexually active) And I knew I never wanted kids. To some people, I probably struck the lottery of casual sex. 

But that's not what this is. 

This is about losing control over your own damn body. Not having kids used to be a choice that you could reverse up until a certain age. Not anymore. And it feels as if your body betrayed you. While you know that you have to love and be yourself because you have no other choice, sometimes you just can't help feeling dysfunctional. 

To add insult to injury, I became an ex party girl. Again, not by choice but because I no longer had the drive. 

I am not asking for sympathy or encouragement. I'm just saying that in life you gain some and you lose some. To OP of #58462, chin up. Perhaps the condition could even help you sieve out those who would love you for who you are, infertility and all your quirks. 

On the note of the party girl thing. I am really glad I had the wildest bedroom adventures in the years before I totally lost my drive.

So really, my 2cents is, as long as you stay safe, and handle relationships appropriately (e.g. don't cheat! Not classy!), there really shouldn't be a moral judgement to human sexuality. To quote a finance concept, this could be a time value of money thing. Also, old saying, a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush. So have fun kiddos, and stay safe!"

Hey there I'm not sure if you're the same person who posted a similar confession previously. I personally experienced incidents 1 & 2 also, but not 3

I was brought up in a family environment that made me have serious trust issues, resulting in me being pretty wary of everyone and building a wall around myself. Since my kindergarten days, everyday was spent feeling pretty emotionless and dead on the inside, where I was neither joyful nor angry, with my classmates all remarking that I was a ""cool and calm"" person. Watching movies with friends became a slight problem as they preferred the sad kinds, where they'd bawl their eyes out and look questiningly at me when I didn't join them

Things got pretty heated at home when I was in sec 4 and something snapped inside me, leading me to confide in a trusted adult. While I didn't think that things felt any different after that, it seems like the wall that has been built around me started cracking without me noticing and I started to feel a tiny bit of emotions (on hindsight)

It took a failed relationship in jc to open the emotional floodgates probably because I'm now able to relate to the sad songs and movies, but I will most definitely not recommend that you follow this route hahaha the pain and emotions are not worth the trouble. And even if the relationship works out, it may not be very healthy too as you've not gone into it with the right mindset. One op suggested googling ""alexythymia"" which you can try as well to see if you're able to relate to the descriptions there 

This took quite a bit of courage to write and I hope you won't feel that you're alone on this journey. All the best and good luck to you!"
58554,"What do girls look for in a partner? Would you mind someone who is below average build - not tall, skinny, or both? Do you feel that physical build is important, or is it the personality that counts? Would you feel attraction towards these kind of guys and want to know them more?"

I went for an abortion too when I was still in university days. I did not regret my decision because I cannot give the best for my child. I did not tell my parents or family about it because they will definitely make me bear the child. Just before the abortion, I suffered from some side effect from the medicine the doctor gave and I was vomitting non stop and shivering in cold (when it's like 30 degree outside the clinic). After the abortion, you'll definitely feel guilty, you'll probably be unable to sleep well for a few weeks. But I didn't regret my decision at all. Don't think about what others say, think about what you really want. Do you really want the baby? Don't let those guys that commented on your post to guilt trip you, they are males, they don't have to handle the stress of having a kid. Btw the procedure cost me around $3k."

58537,"Seeing all the posts from ""nice guys/girls"" on here, I thought I should write my own and see what you people think. 

I'm not a nice guy. 

I don't have a chiseled bod; what I have may best be described as average or dad-bod. I'm not Kpop boyband-level of handsome with my looks, but I'm the guy next door with that spark in his eyes and a small smirk curling on one side of his lips.

I have a checkered personal history and engaged in a lifestyle of hedonism and casual sex with multiple partners, both male and female and those in between. I was fully aware of what I was getting myself into, I valued the sexual lessons and practice I got from all those experiences, and throughout all those years of singlehood hedonism and player life I've made sure to keep myself safe and an eye on my sexual and physical health. Thankfully, I'm fine. The upshot of it all is that I can safely say I am very talented in more ways than one to pleasure my future partner in bed. 

I have a temper and I don't trust easy. But if you get my heart then what parts of it I have left is all yours, and yours only. I've no intentions of dating for the sake of it and loyalty/commitment is a non-negotiable criteria I hold myself and whoever I love/am loved by to. I cannot abide cheaters and I cannot abide serial daters, and God help any of my partners if I find out they are cheating on me because I don't give second chances and I will always have a Plan B to get my own back. I'm not good with pacifying girls with cute gestures and wheedling, but I'd like to think I'm the solid shoulder they can rest on when they need comfort most, as well as a strong set of arms to pick them up when they're down and need someone by their side. 

I'm not a nice guy. Not one of those guys from a Korean romance drama, or Augustus Waters from The Fault In Our Stars. 

I'm Liam Neeson from Taken. I'm Severus Snape from Harry Potter. I'm Tony Stark from the Marvel universe. I have a great deal of history and scars in my past. I'm not perfect. But I'm real, I'm working on myself, and I know what I want in life from a future partner. I want someone loving, adventurous, non-judgemental, loyal, committed, not a shrinking violet, someone who wants me for the potential she sees in us combined and not who/where I am right now in life. 

So why's it so hard?

For regular patrons of The Terrace (Computing/Biz Canteen), you guys are familiar with the tiered format of the place. 

There is a plate and utensil deposit stand on the second tier for us to leave our plates after we finished our food. 

I have seen the cleaner auntie having to carry heavy stacks of iron trays and bowls up the steps (a short flight, but steps nonetheless) for the other cleaners to sort through. 

Sometimes she remind us to leave our trays at the main deposit area on the highest tier instead (where the stalls are). Still, I often see her having to make many rounds up and down the steps struggling to carry all the dirty dishes up from the collection area at the lower tier. 

Let's remember to bring it to the main tray collection area at the highest tier! While you may argue that she is 'paid to do her job', I think we can all afford to be more compassionate and less calculative.

Yet she has a classic attachment style of ""fearful avoidant"". She puts up an emotional barrier to people around her yet craving for intimate relationships (friendships included), yet not wanting to admit it and gets offended when people point it out to her. The other day a group of us were just talking about rs, and C just dismissed it's hard for her to find someone she likes. There was this other girl there and I just casually mentioned I have a male cousin I may want to introduce to her aimai. C's face immediately turned black. I knew something was up. After the group dispersed, I approached her later to ask her, she said ""Why didn't you think to intro me also, am I not good enough?""

Males on the other hand during march 14 white day return the flavour to the females.

Also there is more than one way of answering many questions."", which is just another way of saying that the questions are badly designed and he can't provide a solution without getting questioned by all the students. It also DISGUSTS me that he claims everything is ""straightforward"", ""obvious"" or ""common sense"" where he himself can't explain the concepts.

I miss running around chasing and kicking a ball in a team. Is there any soccer game in school which I can just join and play non competitively, just for fun? :)"
