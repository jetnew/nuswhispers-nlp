57088,"Anyone has been on a SEP trip to Eindhoven University of Technology before? I was recently offered a place there but I have some questions regarding the study culture there.

1) I have heard that the study culture at TU/e is independent. But how different is it from NUS since personally I feel NUS learning culture is already quite independent.

2) In addition, are exams at TU/e really that difficult to pass, even more than NUS exams? 
 
3) Moreover, I understand that  TU/e has only implemented english bachelor courses recently. In that case, are the teachers fluent in teaching in english or is there still a communication barrier?

57079,"On hindsight after 3 Semesters, I really think everything was wrong with CE1101. 
The Teach2Learn (T2L), MapleTA, classroom tables and chairs, building floating tower, bridge building, using microstation, the lab sessions, it felt like an 8MC module squeezed into 6MC, the flip-classroom gone wrong in every way possible. Lessons were crammed, and we nearly didn't finish syllabus on time. There was no finals, but a final quiz before reading week which was essentially a finals. 

It was so horrible that every other module after that felt so much better. I think the profs tried their best but this new syllabus, really need to rethink."

All my other mods are on that list, including the ones with tutorials I can't ballot for yet. Who should I email, and should I do that now, or just wait until Itineration 2 to see if it finally shows up? "
57072,"What is the percentage of people in NUS under scholarships? So many people around me are under this and that scholarships and get monthly allowances. They get paid to study. They are making a living from studying.

I feel like I'm the only odd one out who is paying school fees out of my own pocket. I don't get paid to study. I have to pay to study. No my parents don't pay. "
57071,"I haven't found a job since graduation last year. Part of it was my fault, since I didn't start actively looking for a job thinking I could work in the family business. But my dad and I didn't see eye to eye, and I didn't feel I'm capable of handling it since I have 0 exposure to the industry.

Now I'm actively looking for engineering job. I have fixed my resume with help from CFG, applying here and there, but no one seemed to care. I know I keep making accidental mistakes. I'm almost at verge of giving up, knowing the fact that HR is usually merciless. Or maybe I'm really good for nothing."

Hey, considering that you're still a 2nd year student, I'll say not to give up on trying to attain that 2nd upper-you still have a decent stretch to go, although yes, it may be hard. 
Regarding your question: I'm actually just a y4 psychology student, so I can't say what exactly it is like out there regarding the competition for masters. However, I've been talking to people and professors and what they say seem to converge on one point which is that: it is really hard for you to be even considered for masters with a 2nd lower. While that's not to say that it is impossible, chances are not high. In the event that you do end up with a 2nd lower, make sure you complete a thesis by all means first. I've heard that many places do not even look at your application if you have not completed a thesis. Then do whatever you can to beautify your resume--publish a paper (maybe your thesis with your professor), take up jobs/volunteering/interns etc relating to the field. 

Good luck! And try your best in obtaining a 2nd upper for now"
57067,"Is underloading your modules allowed in FASS? I'm from poly, with 20 UEMs granted (so I don't have to take 5 mods worth of UEs) plus I sat thru Roots & Wings worth 2 MCs in a previous sem. I got freaked when I saw NUS' guideline saying we are only allowed to take minimum 18 MCs worth of mods, when this sem I am taking 4 mods that feed to my Major requirements. Plus... I have external commitments and responsibilties hence I actively planned and chose to take 4 mods this sem. Without ignoring any Major specifications. Is it okay to underload on the basis that I simply have cut 1 UE mod out of the usual load? Will the Dean's office be fine with this? I still have 5 sems left - I want to stay on till Y4/S2 and I don't wish to graduate 1 sem early... which poly folks should supposedly strive for. Anyone underloaded b4...? And had poly/tertiary edu exemption MCs?"

57061,"What is the purpose of NUS offering a 'Pass' degree? I mean, why even have a degree classification for individuals who have a 2.00-2.99 CAP?

Isn't the average CAP in NUS around 3.80?? By allowing such students to graduate from this institution, are they not lowering the standard and ranking of NUS?

Whenever I tell my friends about this problem, they can't relate to me. Although some of them try to comfort me by saying that it's okay and stuff like that, I feel like they don't take it seriously. I can't just get over it. It's really tough, but I'm trying to overcome it little by little. Is there anyway that helps me feel less anxious? "

Things are going fine between us and our relationship is definitely stable. I am ready for marriage but he seems to want to wait for a few more years. I hinted to him about settling down, but it seems like he is prioritising career at this point. Should I just wait for him? It seems like that’s the only thing I can do now. I don’t even know if he will propose to me as he often said that diamond ring is a waste of money. We have applied for a bto and our house will be ready in two years time. We would probably just get married then. I am actually quite upset that he most likely would not propose, but there is nothing I can do about it."

If the only claim to the effectiveness of the notes is the fact that the buyer got an A/A+, I really don't know if it's trustworthy. After all, so many factors could have played into that A/A+ - like marking leniency, bell curve conditions, exam-day conditions, preparation sufficiency, etc.

Cause you will be happy as you get a good job or enter a good uni cause of it. Not guaranteed, but it helps. No doubt about it. You want to get a good bf/gf. Get married. You feel happy as you get good companion in life. But happiness is a state of emotion. Comes and goes like a wave. Everything will become normal again when you got used to it. 5 years after you get that degree. 10 years after you got married. So when will the pursue of happiness end? Instead of pursuing it as your end goal, maybe just be content and enjoy whatever you have right now but yet still have the work ethics to improve your life?

But my fear is that if I took up a part time job, my parents may think that I aren't intending to find a full-time job despite me having explained to them.

57001,"#56994: that's how my previous relationship ended.

We were together for 3 years and there was a weird period when I have already been working for 2 years while she was just freshly graduated. It was a stressful time for her: not being able to find a job and feeling like a failure. it was rather bad of me not knowing how to assuage my gf's worries. I was rather callous, sarcastic, and uncaring at times. Things started peeling off; over a long period of time. Maybe don't come over to have dinner with her family (it was frequent), maybe ""I want some time alone going places"", etc ... 

Then it's the ""let's take a break from each other"". A month later, breakup. There were tear, drunkenness, bitterness. etc ...

Our relationship had lots of ups and down. We had sex, then we stopped. Why we stopped was because of a stupid argument (my bad). In short, she wanted to do it bareback during her period and I don't. I was a hypochondriac and when I knew she had unprotected sex with her bf, I was reluctant to do the same with her afterwards. I tried to played it as ""it's not that I don't trust you; I don't trust your ex"". it somehow ended as ""OK, let's not do it"" but because we were horny af, we continued with everything else. Thinking back, the frequency of arguments picked up when we stopped the sex.

I learned a lot from that episode and grew from it. How to tone down the sarcasm, general bitterness, and pessimism. How to be supportive and not snap at the first sign of trouble. And how when you start having sex, don't stop. Good thing too, since about 2 months after the breakup, I met my now-wife. It has been a good 4 years, 2 being married."
