57898,"Generally, there's a 3 categories of posts and they reflect the op's intentions. Those that have too much time and want to grab attention, those that are sharing an experience or discovery, and those that genuinely seek advice. For the last group, if u don't have any constructive or substantive advice, don't comment. I've seen so many people making witty comments, or downplaying the issue to feel smart. Would u appreciate it if u are making a difficult decision and people are just making light of it or putting out the obvious? Obviously, NUSWhispers is not the right avenue to seek help in certain matters, yet there'll always be posts about these themes; Even so, i think the op will appreciate if you can direct them to people or forums that do through tagging, instead of ridiculing the post."

What to do? I don't think the keyboard warriors are out to get her. 

If anything, she should apologise for playing the race card and I think the saga will perhaps die down faster. 

Crying of racism when you are obviously the majority in this country is precisely the reason why netizens are making up all sorts of satire. 

I will rather the nation makes a big fuss of it (for both the good and bad things), than to have us letting the topic die down. What's the difference of doing so from implicitly condoning such actions by Jovina Chua?"

57889,"To poster of #57842 advising on not telling gf about past prostitute history, it is a dishonest, coward and dishonorable mentality. Allow me to tell you why. 

We live by our own action. If you have the gut to do it, then you should deal with it and live with the consequence. Be responsible for your own action. If you feel it’s 自讨苦吃 or asking for trouble, then you shouldn’t have done it in the first place. If you try to hide, it means you are apprehensive. Then why didn’t you think of it before you do it? As the saying goes, 早知今日，何必当初?

Human make mistakes. Doing something wrong, remorseful or regrettable is ok. But not owning up and living up to the consequence is irresponsible, dishonest and cowardice.

Your mentality is dangerous. Fundamentally, you are basically saying you can do anything wrong as long as you can cover up and hide to avoid potential trouble. 

Hiding about prostitution might be a trivial issue. However, the true danger is that if you manage to get away on this issue, it will subconsciously plant a seed in your head and slowly distort your moral principle into “you can do anything wrong as long as you can cover up and hide to avoid potential negative consequence“. Slowly and gradually, you will go down a slippery slope and test the limit and apply the same mentality to other aspect of life, ultimately eroding away your morality. 

People don’t cover up their extramarital affair, thieving or even manslaughter from day one. It all started off when they were kids covering up trivial things like eating up their brother’s cookie. "
57887,"My boyfriend is from the uk, and we have been tgt for 3 years now. He came here when he was 16 because of his parent's job. Hes just 2 months older than me. Late last year he introduced me to his parents and they were really warm and welcoming, however when i brought him to see my parents early january, my parents were shocked (or stunned?) and it was an awkward dinner? They were pretty quiet the entire dinner and he had to try break the ice, it felt like he was the host instead. I did already hint to them my boyfriend was ang moh but im ashamed that asian parents behave like this. But anyway my boyfriend didnt think much of it as he said it was the first time so perhaps they were not used to it, he even offered to bring them out for more trips around singapore to get to know them better. I cant express how embarassed i am but he's a rare gem. 

My parents spoke to me abt him and asked me to bring him along for CNY visiting. Well, im having a nightmare imagining if all my relatives were gonna be like my parents, what am i gonna do? Should i bring him along and risk the awkwardness? "

57885,"Question: am I the asshole here in the hypothetical situations below?

A few years ago, I came across this ubereats promo code which gave the users 10 dollar off without other conditions. I decided to share this code with my other university friends in a group chat along with my own personal invite code. By using my personal invite code, I will earn another 10 dollar as long as my friends use my code but they did not know that the 2nd code is mine. In the end, we received a lot of credits but my friends could have gotten 10 dollar more if they share their code within their family. 
1. Am I an asshole here?


I am graduating soon and the group of friends are going on graduation trip. I volunteer to buy the air tickets as I have a credit card which offer cash back on online purchases. However, my friends do not know I have such card and I will not share the cashback with them. The friends will still be paying the price listed on the website. 
2. Am I an asshole here?

Changing the aforementioned situation slightly. The card do not offer cashback but instead it offers points which will allow me to enjoy discounts on foods and stuff (and cannot be converted into cash). 
3. Am I an asshole here?


My group of friends are buying Starbucks and I volunteered to use my membership card to get the drinks so that I can earn points on my card. They will return me the price of their drinks. 
4. Am I an asshole here?

I will expect the answers to different questions to vary so I want to see where the line should be drawn. Thanks!"
57884,"Sigh, seeing everyone's Instastory of CNY just sucks. And I thought Christmas was bad enough. Everyone being with friends and family.

Meanwhile, my dad who cheated on my mom, and is still being verbally abusive and not apologising for it even after a family intervention. Relatives on my dad's side no longer talk due to some petty argument that happened >5 years ago, so no CNY on that side. (Mom's side is at least decent though, so at least I have that). 

Everyone is talking about family virtues and how family is precious, but screw that - no everyone is blessed to have a normal healthy family okay?

57880,"I'm rather disappointed with my sex life. Don't get me wrong, I like sex, but I just can't seem to get enthusiastic about it since my sex life currently is frankly quite bad.

My boyfriend finishes a little too fast, even when we drag out the foreplay. I don't think I've ever finished, usually I just head to the toilet to finish up myself. He's tried oral and all, but it seems to be a problem with his technique. I'm pretty sure it's not a problem with me since my ex had no problem getting me to finish at all.

Its disappointing. I've talked to my other friends and they seem to agree that's common? Like all their boyfriends don't really last long or manage to get them to finish. I've tried advising him but seems like I've had to fake orgasms and honestly I don't think I'll ever finish during sex.

What can I do to improve this? I've mentioned I have trouble finishing before, but all that does is make him ask if I've finished yet a ton of times during sex. He's simply not as good in bed as I'd like."

57848,I've been in a relationship for 1.5 years and I don't really romantically love my partner. He is great and I think he really does love me. I think I am settling (he's a great guy tho) as I'm afraid I won't be able to find someone who is this good. Don't get me wrong. I still very much love him as a person and care a lot about him. I just don't romantically love him. I have spent many weeks thinking about whether I should end my relationship or throw away my concerns and commit to a lifetime with him. I know we'll be okay but I'm not sure whether its for the best. Any advice is appreciated.
57847,"In relation to #57847
I'm actually quite curious about opinions on doxxing/mockery of people who do stupid things, and were unlucky enough to have footage end up on social media.
There are people who sympathise with the ""I am chinese"" lady (God I can't even remember her name as of now) when it comes to the doxxing/mockery portion, but I don't recall any such reactions during the Eric Cheung case? I'm not stating that Cheung shouldn't have been doxxed, but rather I'd like to throw out the qns of whether doxxing is an appropriate form of punishment, at all.

PERSONALLY, I find doxxing Choi ridiculously cruel. It wasn't exactly uncalled for, but I find it way too severe, given the nature of her case. However I don't seem to feel the same way about Cheung though. Perhaps it has to do with the differences in reactions to the cases?
I don't recall any hooha stirred up by Choi/her friends/family while there was still some weird shit going on between Cheung and the driver after their snafu. His underlying  snideness throughout the whole incident maybe?

I won't say that those 2 didn't deserve the nation mocking them; the fact that they continued to behave as such, knowing that their actions would be caught on film, suggests to me that they're 100% committed to whatever they intend to do, and equally committed to the possibility of footage ending up on social media, and the mockery and memes to follow. But doxxing? Is that warranted?

TL;DR @those who actually put in the effort to procure, or even share the personal details of people being mocked, the hell are you trying to achieve? Some may say I'm a hypocrite, but it isn't so much the action of doxxing I'm pissed at, rather our reactions towards the act of doxxing.
If our society has boiled down to the extent where people are supporting  behaviour like this, jeez.
Pretty obvious where I stand on the issue of doxxing. What about the rest of y'all?

Many Singaporeans are judging people or the whole country based solely on the contents on social media. I don't understand how most guys who have never been to China and they have the cheek to say they hate the country or simply throw all your hateful rants about it.
90% of the content on Facebook/Twitter with regards to China are either hateful, fake or exaggerated, and these content are shared wildly. Whereas the 10% that says good things about the PRC (e.g. drones inventions from DJI, China's economic miracles), people tend to ignore or basically think the articles are just fake. 
The country has done no harm to any of you guys and yet, many of you bullies come together as keyboard warriors to flame them. If you really hate China so much, throw away 90% of the items you own, including those over-hyped iPhones. iPhones are assembled in China (Foxconn) and many of the components are made there too. The only thing that's so-called 'made in USA' is the IP, which is just a paper.

I have been attached to my lady for 4-5 years now, and she used to be seen as ""the one"". We were very happy together and we didn't quarrel throughout the years - till a few months back. It started with her being out with a small group of people, and trust me, I have never once limited or stopped her from going out. She is working, but because of this group, she started hanging out till, on average, 3am in the morning. The most ridiculous of all would be till 5am, despite having work the next day. This would happen in a week and the week following, until i voice my displeasure. She has also been very close to a guy which I think would make a good friend, until recently he decided to confess to her, despite being engage himself. Afterwards, we had some tiff and the conversation did subside a little, but a surfeit of chats followed there after. Despite she telling me that she had told the other party that they should limit their conversation, the chats didn't tone down a little. Verily, the chats nowadays might have revolve around work (I don't know) because I didn't want to read, hence I might be slightly overreacting a little. Now here is my question. Given all this, I didn't tell her to stop talking to him in the first place because I know there will need to work together. But I only wished that she would try to keep the conversation to the minimal because in my opinion, the guy stepped over the ""boundary of a friendship"" and how would things just be back to ""being normal"" once again. Is it on my part, that I am overreacting or being too sensitive? Because I do admit I am of a sensitive sort. What should I do because her being ""not the one"" has been crossing my mind. I hope you guys will put yourself in my shoes because it is always easy to say that ""since you have doubts, it meant that the trust is gone and bla bla bla"", but imagine for once, she was and might still be the one because there wasn't any issue prior.
