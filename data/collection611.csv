61195,"I am staying in RVRC and there is a mass food poisoning happening in the dining hall. I only read from the news. Most of the students in RVRC are unaware about this incident, except in the news. Why the dining in charge by Office of Housing Services kept silent from informing the students? What assurance can Office of Housing Services give to the students?

I went to their management office and was told by a plumb guy that everything was still under investigation and no comments given. I asked why the students only got to know from the news. He told me should be his Director tell the reporters. Upon asking who was his Director, he refused to reveal the contact. I only get to know his Director's name is called Mr Sng Jin Soon.

Can Office of Housing Services be proactive informing the students rather than us speculating on the ground?"
61194,"Is this what has become of the self-entitled strawberry generation? Thinking that personal safety is also entitled to them? No one owes you your safety, much more, a criminal.  By promoting education and deterrence for the aggressor ONLY, makes the society more vulnerable as we are at the mercy of the aggressor. Instead, promote education and deterrence for both aggressors or vulnerable parties would be more practical. AND NO, education for the vulnerable is NOT victim blaming. A crime is a crime and asking the public to adopt preventive measures do not invalidate the law. 
On a side note, don't tell me to beware of scam calls, instead tell the scammers not to scam me??? I am sorry scammers don't give a shi* about your feelings and safety. "

61190,"Recently our group for one econs module has a freeloader. The extent of freeloading is horrifying in a sense where she hasn’t done anything at all, ghosting all our chats. We were contemplating on whether to report her for freeloading.

While some says dont as it is common for freeloading to occur and you may work tgt in other mods, it’s just not fair that others have to tank for you esp in week 12 where we have many submissions and tests too.

I was just wondering. If there is a severe freeloader, will you raise it to your profs?"
61188,"I find it hard to date local girls after returning from my university education overseas. Spending a few years living and studying abroad has somehow widened my perspective on life, and added to my experiences as a person. On the bright side, it probably means I've become a changed and better person from my exposure to the world outside of Singapore (and I don't mean the sort of curated overseas experience in any number of cookie-cutter metropolitan Singapore-esque city). But on the flip side, I find local/Asian girls impossibly suffocating with their relative passiveness, lack of opinions, a general feeling of total sheltered upbringing, sexual conservativeness, and shallowness in life, happy to just be distracted by vapid topics of what's the latest in showbiz or workplace gossip or shopping or fashion or whatever. 

Am I the only one who feels this way? Or am I holding local girls to standards too high for them to meet? I'm sure there must be local girls with strong distinct personalities, who can both give and take opinions intelligently and with conviction, who are well-read and spoken, who have dreams and aspirations and purposes in life that go way beyond surviving month to month, and who aren't subscribing to that old trope about Asian girls being sexual prudes or so passive that they need the guy to make the first move in love and in bed before they know what to do or say for their own enjoyment and satisfaction.

61165,"I am actually so angry at what happened today. I know posting anonymously on NUSWhispers isn't going to help the problem much, but I just want to see the oh so useful feedback this community never fails to offer!

My friends and I have been talking about a female acquaintance of ours with a ""bad rep"" for being a well... player who cheated on all her previous boyfriends. Naturally, we badmouthed her for really long and to be honest, it was just a lot of toxic fun. 

The next day though, I saw her in the corridor and she was really charming when we spoke. What started off as a friendly conversation developed into a close friendship, until one day I decided to get into a relationship with her. All was good until one day... she cheated on me.

I mean wtf is this shit? I know some friends of mine chided me along the lines of ""why did you get into a relationship despite knowing of the risks associated with the personality of said girl"". That really made me so angry because I AM THE VICTIM of this case. How can you victim blame me? In my defence I am completely faultless and there was nothing I could do to have averted this whole situation!

To the people on the outside blaming me, I seriously question your intelligence and you definitely shouldn't be accepted into university because the earth is flat and I am infinitely wiser than you. "

61161,"I used to be under the parents control. I used to listen to them and study non stop. Until one day at age 15, I woke up from all the stress and meaninglessness. People took turns saying

1) “If you only do what’s “useful”, then what’s the point of living?!” 

2) “It’s not the materialistic things in life that matter. Have you learnt the learning of love?”

3) “marks, marks, marks. Just cold, hard figures, right? Don’t you know other stuff humans live for? What is music, what is love, what is art? These are what feed our soul, not marks!”

I snapped out of my state as a cold-hearted robot who only knew how to achieve cold, hard, marks. I decided I’d stop being so opportunistic, who would give up love, enjoyment, music and art for those high marks which eventually mean nothing. 

I didn’t want to work towards being a cold sociopath who’s all for numerical grades and cares nothing about love. Yes, I’m “distracted”, but so? Should we just do things that are “useful”? 

Entering NUS soon. I didn’t study at all since age 15. I spent all my after school hours watching romance dramas and dating. Because love, not money, makes the world go round. "
61160,"In light of all the angsty retorts due to the recent Z's case, as evident from this page, I would like to give some of my perspectives on this issue.

I grew up in a relatively conservative Asian family, and I would consider myself a feminist. However, for the past few years, I have been afraid to tell people that I am a feminist, and even to the extent of being afraid to admit that I am one. 

As a female who has seen and witnessed many forms of sexism, be it in school or society, I was drawn to advocate for the idea of feminism, the ideal society where females are seen as equals as male. I attended an all girls secondary school, and it was very easy to find friends who resonated with my perspective. Fast forward to my adult life, I realised that the moment i mentioned that i was a feminist, I would be met with a startled and perhaps disgusted response from my male counterparts, and sometimes even my female friends will ask me to drop it.

As an adult now, I do understand why the word 'feminism' is such a taboo topic, especially in Singapore where females are not as blatantly disadvantaged as compared to other societies. Some might even argue that females have a greater advantage compared to males, as evident from the rising reported cases where females accuse the male of r***, even though it may not have happened at all.

Truth is, I do not know how to feel about the phrase ""victim blaming"" anymore. Bottomline, the way a girl dresses does not warrant an invitation to be harassed, and if you disagree with that you are an a**hole and deserve to be incarcerated. Sexually harassing a female when they are vulnerable, e.g. drunk, is not justifiable, and like i mentioned before, you deserve the full brunt of the law.

However, the grey area begins when consent is involved. What warrants a consent for s**ual intercourse? I mean for starters, I don't give verbal ""yes you can go ahead"" consent before I do it with my boyfriend. But under the Singapore law, I have the ability to sue my bf for rape, and maybe even get him charged. Hence, I do recognise the grey area in such situations, and herein lies the crux of the problem. 

In many many cases, when a girl reports being harassed, the authorities usually do not charge the guy due to lack of evidence of denied consent. And that sucks, it really does. It makes me scared as a female, scared that one day something does happen to me, and my perpetrator can get away scott free, while I am just labelled as ""the girl who made a false claim"".

However, I do recognise the circumstances in which this can be exploited, which is why although I am a firm believer of consent, I also believe that we females should not land ourselves in a situation where the need for consent is blurred. Examples would be going overseas with someone and sharing a bed, locking both of yourselves behind closed doors in a room, making obvious sexual advances throughout the night in an isolated place. Even though your intention may not be s**, but just know that there is a very weak case for you if anything does happen.

In the case of Z, I was more alarmed by the fact that the ""innocent before proven guilty"" law did not apply to him. From what I heard, he lost his sponsorship and his housing accommodation in school, amidst circumstances where many victim's stories were debunked and said to be untrue. I do not know what to believe, because this applies to the grey area of consent which I aforementioned, but it is just scary to think that social media now has the ability to destroy someone before the facts are even verified.

Although I did mention that many of such cases usually go unreported or even dismissed by the authorities, is this really a step forward? With anonymous accounts sending anonymous stories, is that really the truth? 

Welp, I'm just confused rn. Hopefully that dude gets what he deserves if the stories are indeed true, but if it isn't, I fear for the future of our generation and how there will be a shift of sentiment to ""guilty until proven innocent"". In any case, cheating is wrong, so screw you dude."

61157,"I met girl A recently who reminded me of my ex a lot. We've been hanging out quite a bit and are getting along rather well. 

While this is going on, I have also met my ex in a recent gathering (we share a group of friends, just that she hangs out less with this group compared to me). We didn't really end on a bad note so we're still somewhat on talking terms, and talked quite a bit during this gathering.

I seemed to have developed feelings for girl A. I definitely enjoy hanging out with her. On the other hand, I'm starting to recall memories of my ex, which are stirring up emotions. I'm confused if I really developed feelings for girl A, or it's just dormant feelings of my ex creeping back. 

I don't know if it's a good idea, but I'm been thinking if I should talk to my ex about this. Talking to girl A is out of the question, because she's attached, and a generally good friend who I want to keep. Whereas my ex is single, and based on my understanding, she would be cool to talk about this. 

Based on all these, I hope the NUSWhispers community can help me answer 2 questions: Do y'all think I have feelings for girl A or my ex? Is it a good idea to talk to my ex about this? Thanks."
61155,"Have been with my GF for about a year and a half now, and we started having sex about half a year in. We have a kinda regular sex life, at about twice or thrice a month. It's not much, but we're both kind of busy.

61151,"hi again im the op of #61151

I thank those who have raised good points for discussion and will duly ignore the rest because class part is not assessed here.

The very purpose of my post was to set up some basis of moral evaluation so good job everyone that pointed that I'm being fairly idealistic. However, on the topic of precaution which extends to basic acts like locking your car door etc etc, I've come to understand why some of you pin the same amount of blame on a robber and negligent car owner. You can't trust anyone to not steal your car after all - that's fair and valid. If someone puts $100 on a table in clb and it gets stolen, even me, the MoRaL iDeAliSt would find it stupid that you'd even do that in the first place

But we're talking about basic ethics here - maybe DON'T steal or r*pe etc etc etc. Granted, I'll edit my previous stance: if you walk out on the streets with a sign saying please stab me vs if someone stabs you because you were just walking around (yes i'm avoiding talking about r*pe), an instinctual response that ""oh you were literally?? asking to be stabbed??"" is warranted. That being said, we (or rather only some of us, judging by the comments) DO recognize the act of murder is inherently wrong.

I still stand by my take that victim-blaming is CLEARLY wrong, but I will add the nuance that we need to identify the aggressor as such first. If just because someone's stupid or ignorant, they deserve to be attacked/harassed/exploited, rip the comments section. Sidenote: it's pretty sad if you need to respond with an edgy kindergarten level reeeeeeeeead - I sincerely thank those who genuinely thought about the issue and responded, regardless of what your stance was/is."

61145,"I recently took a module on IE2100, Probability Models with Applications. It was perhaps the most unfair and unacceptable test that any NUS student can take. Let me explain why: 
Firstly, students who arrive in the exam lecture theater before the start of the exam can immediately start the paper. As some students effectively arrive 30 minutes before the paper, they are allocated 30 minutes more to work on their mid-term.

Secondly, the lecturer provided ""hints"" on the projector screen without telling students about it. This lead to around half of the cohort which did not see the hints on the projector at all as they simply referred to their question paper which they took from the lecturer. Some students also did not see it as they were sitting at the back of the lecture theater, which make it hard for them to look at the projector screen, as it was assumed that the lecturer was flashing the same ""question paper"" as what was given to students.

Upon complaints by students after the end of the paper, the lecturer stated that he will reward the final grade base on the higher of the scores from either the mid-term or the finals. However, this leads to a systematic unfairness for students who did not see the ""hints"" as during the finals, all the students will likely be given the same question paper. This will make it exponentially hard for students who did not see the ""hints"" to catch up to their peers.

I do hope that by sharing about the unfairness from this exam, NUS can possibly take some actions with regards to this issue. "

61128,"Hi again, I'm the OP of #60907 (FANG data point). I posted my comp data with the best intentions, but somehow, they were misconstrued into something totally inaccurate. I find myself trying to slay the Hydra, where more heads appear as I cut them off. So let me share more details to shed more light:

My salary figures are not exceptionally high. If you can't ask your friends for these figures, you can always check out levels.fyi. They crowdsourced starting salary figures for each company and each level (including indeed). My salary is definitely within those band for the corresponding levels. Maybe on the lower side for the levels where I was promoted.

The taxes I quoted are accurate, and do include Social Security Tax (6.2%), Medicare Tax (1.45%), and Medicare Surtax (0.9%). It's easy to question how is it that I have such a ""low"" effective tax rate. The answer lies in the word ""effective"". While everyone's tax situation is different in the US, there are a few standard ways in calculating and reducing your tax liability:
- Taxable income is quite different from gross income. It is subjected to deductions. The basic deduction is just to take the standard deduction of 12.2k (pegged to inflation). So, my taxable income is reduced to 317k - 12.2k = 314.8k
- I maxed out my Traditional 401k contribution of of 19k. 401k is the US equivalent of CPF, but voluntary. Income that I divert to my 401k account is tax deferred. That means I reduce my taxable income this year by 19k, and any withdrawals at retirement are treated as income. I won't go into details of 401k, but at retirement, your income is so low that the tax rate for your 401k withdrawal is also around the 10-12% range in the future. So, now my taxable income is 286k
- Social security tax is only applied to your first 132.9k of your income. The limit is pegged roughly to inflation, so in 2016, it is applied to your first 118.5k of your income. This also means that for 2019 I'm going to pay 8.2k in Social Security Taxes (or 2.6% of my expected income of 317k).
- Medicare tax is 1.45% applied to all gross income (4.6k for 2019)
- Medicare Surtax is applied to taxable income above 200k. For 2019, I expect to pay $774
- Federal taxes are progressive. This means that you pay 10% on your first 10k of taxable income, 12% on your next 20k, and so on. Even though I'm in the 35% tax bracket, my effective federal tax, after all deductions, is 75k (or 24% of Gross)
- Adding all taxes together I get 89k, or 28% of Gross.

Sales tax is ~10%. No question that this is higher than in Singapore. However, groceries are not taxed, and I don't spend much in general. Fun fact: I buy a year's supply of shaving kit whenever I'm back in Singapore as you have no idea how expensive those razors are.

Jordan Dea-Mattson's calculation of 50-60% taxes is just plain wrong. Perhaps his back-of-napkin calculation used marginal tax rate, and unlimited SST + medicare surtax + no 401k contribution. If there something big I'm missing here, please let me know because I'll need to file a correction on my tax returns before I get deported.

Point is, I'm just another guy offering another data point. Most of data here (taxes, rent, salary bands) can be verified on the Internet. You just need to put in the effort to actually do those calculations.

PS: I could do an AMA over NUSWhispers to answer any other questions about my comp if there is enough interest. When there is sufficient responses, I'll try to answer as long as I can anonymize my identity and company."

61117,"Just saw that NUS economics society is giving out welfare packs with metal straws and reusable containers and I’m honestly kinda disappointed. Other events have given out these things which has just led to great wastage because a lot of people already own a set of metal straws and reusable containers (most ppl have Tupperware anyway)!! And the number of times you have to reuse a container to outweigh the carbon footprint of a disposable has been proven to be really large (mostly in the thousands depending on what materials). While the thought is great, the effects aren’t. I doubt the containers and straws were sourced locally as well and the shipping would’ve hurt the environment more. Ironically, econs students can take the environmental economics module, would’ve expected them to do better at weighing costs and benefits :(( I rly hope you guys find a way around this!

61108,"After reading many relationships post here, I would like to remind girls to think twice before getting a boyfriend or husband who is younger than you. 
One simple reason is you are going to look older and much older when the time comes. Ladies age much faster when they hit 30s and if they give birth late. Given the current statistics, many girls are getting married later in life and that meant most will give birth late too. For man, their appearance stays about the same from 30s to maybe late 40s so they appear to age slower. Therefore, imagine you looking like a 40 y/o auntie but your husband looks like your younger brother in his 30s.
Next, is sex life. This might be a taboo for many or the issue wasnt raised to be heard. The older generation may or may not face the issue but it is highly unlikely that they would share this with us if they had the problem. Back to my point. Females face menopause earlier in life, many in their 40s now. Their sex drive drops tremendously and it also hurts in bed due to biological reasons. However, most males do not face this problem and their sex drive remains high till 70s or even older. Now, do you see the age gap in difference? 
Could this shed some light on why old men like to date young girls? All the ONS and mistresses?  
There are also news on man beating up wife for refusing sex... 
People always say that age is just a number, but I hope that this gives the girls an extra considering factor when choosing a boyfriend and their future spouse. 
I am open to anyone's opinion on this issue but please no trolling, thanks. "

61103,"Should i appeal? I am a poly student and I have received my application result. I got into electrical engineering which wasn't my first choice. There were a few computing course and CEG before it. But i wasn't accepeted into any of it.

My course was electrical engineering from np and my cgpa was 3.9 which is well within igp and my cca was gold with honour with a few competitions related to programming under my portfolio. I feel that it was my horrendous O level (No A math) that causes them to rejectme.

I need some advices so the questions remain. Do i have a chance in appealing. And which courses has a higher chance for me CS or CEG?"

61101,"Hi, can i get some advice, especially from seniors, please :') Recently, I've been applying for this great 6-month internship opportunity which is very relevant to my future career path. However, if I end up being fortunate enough to get it, I will have to take an LOA and end up graduating one semester later than my friends! Does graduating off-cycle harm my future career opportunities? Will companies only look to hire fresh grads during the June period? Is it worth it to take this LOA? Do you have any advice, please help this severely conflicted NUS student :"") "
61100,"I had a really scary experience with a recruiter, i posted my resume online and she reached out to me. We had a chat about an opportunity and she sent my resume to her client, few weeks later she called me 5-6 times (even on working hours) saying that I was short listed for an interview. I have already received an offer and told her im not interested, verbally and via email. Still the next day, she insisted on calling me and forwarded my phone number to her colleague who persuaded me to attend the interview. I gave in after tolerating their incessant phone calls and attended their rescheduled interview today. Still, it wasnt really a pleasant experience, is this how techinical recruiters behave nowadays? I will categorize this as harassment seriously, and I am per say a talented person, just an average coder.."
