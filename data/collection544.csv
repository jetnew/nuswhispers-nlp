54498,Oh No I'm PMS-ing and mulling over why a close friend of mine dropped me suddenly and cut off all ties with me leaving me severe trust issues and a general longing for her even though she doesn't even want to look at me in the numerous common modules we take together. Ha ha feels bad man.
54497,I made a new friend a few days ago and thought of giving a gift to cheer him on for finals since its just in a few weeks time. Is it a good idea to do so and if it is what gift should I give?
54495,"Storytime!
So I have this friend whom I thought I was pretty close with. Did our internship at the same company. Could click pretty ok. Then, new semester, we took the same mod. I usually got the concepts a little faster and would tell him what to focus on and explain how it works. Even when weekly assignments came out, when I found the answer, I would share it cos he is a good friend. Slowly he didnt even come to tutorials at all, but i went anyways and still update him on some important stuff that happens. So recently I felt very one sided and indignant that he plays so much computer games and still can complete assignments on time because I have already figured out most of the shit for him. Even during midterms, I was particularly stressed out so i got a lower score than him. Then, when I went for tutorial, tutor gave an explicit answer to how to solve the problem for that week. I took it but didnt share with said friend. I was indignant and thought that maybe this was where it should stop. So I (criticise me all you like) became a fake friend and lied that i also dont know how to complete the assignment when I already submitted it. Even near the deadline, he tried to check on my progress to see if I got an answer, probably so he can copy it, but I told him I gave up. So the deadline passed. I asked if he knew how to do, and he said he got a mutual friend who got a model answer from another person. And even when he knew how to do it, he didnt think of me. Should I be outright angry at him for not thinking of me as a friend or just pretend to be friends and take revenge at the critical moment?

Also, if you are the friend and you are reading this, please accept this huge FUCK YOU!"

54492,"It's really tough trying to find a job nowadays, especially those that you like... I am a recent life sciences graduate who is hoping to be a medical technologist. Many people thought I would be much more suited for research as I graduated with a FCH. Thing is, I know for sure I will not go into research again as I know from my FYP that research is really not for me. Furthermore, I had a rather nightmarish experience with my FYP, which further convince me that research is not a viable choice for my long term career. 

However, here comes the problem, I had been job searching since 6 months ago but it seems like only research-related jobs are willing to give me an offer. On the other hand, some medical technologist posts did offer me an interview, questioning me on why I would choose this job when I have a FCH. The short answer is because I believe I will have passion for clinical type of jobs. 

I did not get any medical technologist jobs till now and  from what people around had been telling me, it seems like a FCH is over-qualified for the job. Is this really the case? For my expected salary, I only stated the average pay for fresh grad, which is around $3k. 

Could any life science seniors provide some advice on this please? I really don't want to do research again :( 

Thanks in advance! "

Whenever I see photos of wedding which the fb Friend didn’t invite me, I will be very happy. Wish it occurs more often.

Hope this wedding period will eventually past. I wish I’m a loner. And pls I wasn’t even that active in cca.

People thinks that whenever a distant Friend catches up with them for insurance or mlm, I however am afraid of weddding invites 

fml.

To all those thinking of planning wedding dinners pls do not overbook tables! You are not sharing your joy with others when you invite them to your wedding but the truth is you freaking overbooked! And want them to pay for your mistake. Very irresponsible.  If you are a true Friend you won’t invite them

My new year wish. No more baby showers, no more house warming, no more wedding dinner. At least not every week"

54458,"To #54458

Instead of sending application to a lot of companies, I chose to send to maximum of 2 at the same time. And it's the 2 that I really want.for both companies, I sent very different resume and write up because I wanted to customise to their organisation goal. I told myself to ""only move on to the next one when they reject"". So I waited. I also had intentions go call if I don't receive any emails or calls.

I received a call about 2 weeks later for first interview scheduled 2 weeks from the call. I went there, applied for a position thats not my area of studies. Throughout the interview, rather than giving pre prepared answers, I gave extremely honest answers and show them my true self. I didn't over promise or over sell myself. I was quite scared because they told me there's 200 over applicants for the positions available. 

1 week later, I received a call for second interview scheduled 3 weeks later. This time is to meet the bigger boss asking more of knowing me questions. Same thing, I tried to be real all the time and say things like ""I never thought about it but I'll try to answer"". I told them I'm a little nervous but I'm trying my best. I'm at least 99.99% being the real me during interview. 

2 days after the second interview, I got the offer. 

During this period, I did not submit anymore application and waited for the one I really wanted. I told myself to wait for rejection before I move on as I don't want to face the situation of rejecting another company which sees potential in me. I also was really frank with them about how many jobs I applied. I didn't show that I was desperate as well. 

During this 2 month's if unemployment, I went to do some project that help me gain new skills. I share about these mini projects I'm doing while I'm unemployed, rather than doing nothing at all. 

Period of unemployment doesn't mean that it's bad, it just means you still have a lot of free time for yourself to do whatever you want to do first before you're being tied down by a contract and has 60 percent of your life revolves around work.


I was also ready to be unemployed for 6 months or more if my method doesn't work out, but at least I know I tried my best for every one I customised my profile for. 

Good luck in your job search! "

"
54447,"I am really really really not a troll, I am just an NUS graduate living with a serious problem that has followed me since childhood. Why? Why me? What did I do wrong?

I have graduated from NUS, and my whole life is coloured with confusion, pain and hurt. Please be patient with me, and read my history of unfortunate events. 

Problem 1: 
I am still a bit sure that I have friends, but I just don't have whatsapp and telegram group chats that flood with a continuous stream of messages. Every time I check my phone, it is blank and empty. I really do not know why, and how, the whatsapp groups of everyone else light up like a christmas tree with a never ending barrage of messages from everyone. 

I have group chats, but none of them are THAT active. 

All it takes is 2 people who chat among themselves in the group, and all the other 18 in the same group can get 100 messages without having to do anything. Right??? That sounds easy, but why is this never happening to me? Why is my phone empty? 

Problem 2:
Secondly, I get invited to all sorts of events, but not weddings and proposals. I have been to birthday parties, museum trips, overseas trips and of course the weekly lunch catch ups but not any weddings! I am trying not to be paranoid, but this is a huge red flag, because my whole Instagram is flooded with my peers attending different weddings every week. 

Every weekend, while they somehow manage to get all the elusive invites to wedding after wedding, and I am just out of the loop. I have never received any one wedding invite, because can you believe it, none of my friends are getting married! They are all single and finding a partner. 

But still, how come at this age, I still have not been to a crucial experience of humanity? I am seriously missing out on life. I have never been part of any bridal hen's night either, and I have never been a bridesmaid either. 

If you don't believe a person can get THIS unlucky, look at me. I am the unlucky one. 

Problem 3:
If you think weird things with a probability of less than 5% (such as no wedding invites) happen to me after graduation, please check out yet another puzzling issue that has followed me for FOUR YEARS AT NUS and TWO MORE YEARS IN JC consistently, like a creepy shadow. 

I have never understood, or experienced in person, what it means to be ""overwhelmed"" by work. I only have 30 hours of lessons per week. 24 times 7 is 168 hours, and only 30 hours are for school lessons, so what do I do with the remaining 138 hours? 

But other people with 30 hours (same?) of lessons say that they are so busy and so overworked that they cannot handle the ""stress"". How come everyone life is so busy with (dunno what??) tasks of which I never heard of? dont we have the same lessons? What are the normal popular cool kids doing with their 138 hours that they feel so stressed about? 

In JC, I took 4 subjects and General Paper. Everyone has the same time table, but I was the only one with so much empty space in between? I end class at 2pm, and spent all my after school hours wandering around shopping centres and scrolling Instagram and snapchat until my bedtime.........because if you look at my time table (which ends at 2pm) there is REALLY. NOTHING. TO. DO. 

I don't understand why in JC all my peers say they are ""busy"", ""tired"" (from?) and ""overwhelmed"". We end class at the same time of 2pm. When I am wandering around aimlessly, what is the ""mystery activity"" that my peers are all doing?!

Problem 5: (the consistent problem):

With wedding invites flying around like daggers, how can I still not receive any? 
With group notifications flooding around like a dam, why is my phone still so empty? 
With a certain ""mystery activity"" passed on like wildfire, how come I dunno what to do with the extra 138 hours in NUS, and how come in JC I got nothing to do after 2 pm? 

Empty, empty, empty, says the wind that trails after me since young. What did I do wrong? What did I do in my past life to deserve this cruel treatment? Is there something I can do to be better? 
"
54446,"Sometimes, you get so tired and done with all the shit you get from school and friends that you just want to turn off all your notifications and go missing for one day just to have your ""me-time"". I am barely surviving on sleep and my school commitments just keep getting in the way of sleep. I am so frustrated to the point where I just feel like quitting everything right here, right now."
54443,"Is fass psychology/sociology a very smart course? My jc classmates like to ""hao lian"" on studying fass. As a science student, I still took the conventional - engineering course.

It's out there in the working world. Are grades even that important then? I hear employers dont even look at your grades in the private sector. 
Or you can just hide your performance by getting a pass degree or just stating you have an 'honours' (third class is still honour rite). Some students even get jobs just through their internships, which makes their degree pointless anyway.
