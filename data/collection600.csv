And to clarify things, i don't think its possible for me to ask him out to places because he's in a diff country and studying there. It's been years since i've seen him too. So is there any other way fr me to find out if he likes me too without asking him out? Thank u :)"

60089,"NUS School of Computing orbital sign up closed within 5 hours because of high demand (I'm assuming due to the balloon in cohort size). 

I had 2 back to back midterms from 4PM-8PM and didn't have any chance to sign up at all. 

I am very disappointed and sad, and as a Year 1 with lack of computing background I am unlikely to get any internship at all.

60078,"Being an introvert in a school assigned group of extroverts is difficult. At first I tried adapting myself when around them, being more enthusiastic, blah blah. But I realised two things. 

One, while I adapted to the way they shaped the group dynamics, they did not do the same for me. It was constantly me trying to fit in with them, than vice versa. It's very tiring. 

Two, even though I attempted to 'code switch' around them, they didn't seem receptive to me. There have been many instances, where whether intentionally or not(probably the latter), I have felt divided from the group. 

Little instances of social rejection, which though minor, do add up over the months. For instance, in a group conversation, never addressing me or looking at me even though i participate. Or another one, when we gather at the lab, one of the guys closes the circle of people standing around the bench, even though i am behind him, and i end up physically blocked from whatever is happening. Another one today: attendance sheet being passed around, one of them passes their pen to another group mate so he can sign. When it is my turn, they pass the sheet to me without even looking at me. As i reach for the pen and hold it, they grab it back wordlessly. I use my own pen. Yet another: Some people start laughing about something, I ask what's going on. Guy just looks at me and away. Little things that will sting anybody. I'm sure many would at this point just give up trying to fit in. And I choose to believe they probably don't do those things consciously. 

I understand that our personalities do not match. We don't need/want to be best buddies and hang out together, but i am trying to be a respectful group member. It's not easy for me either to try to fit in. Maybe it's partly the way I interact too of course. I can be reserved and a little awkward. I'm a bit older than them. I'm sure these extroverts find it exhausting/uncomfortable to chat with me and would rather chat within themselves. Fair enough, I don't mind and that would be good for me too. If they want to grab a drink by themselves sure i hope they have a great time. But ignoring or excluding someone in the same group is just...not a nice thing to do. 

I'm alright with it, more or less, because I realise it's not my problem and I need to be confident in myself. Today I just stopped trying to adapt to them to fit in, and had a really nice time in class. Much better than trying to fit in. I was my quiet self and had my break alone with a book and a coffee. It was nice to just do my own thing. The rest of the group looked like they had a good time too, so it was a win win. I know it's unusual to prefer spending break time alone vs chatting with a large bunch of people over food, but that's the way I've always been. And I think as I grow older, I'm learning to embrace that. 

Disclaimer: They are really smart, driven, kind people, as evidenced by...well a whole lot. This is just my perspective. Maybe I am somehow being the weird one here in the way I look/act/speak/am? Maybe I am being overly sensitive? Who knows. Just something I have been mulling over.

60077,"There are a fee types of top students. 

1, the type that exercises regularly (even once or twice a week, but every week is regular), have generally good sleeping habits (consistent sleep cycles, very little ""last minute rushes""), great discipline (to read and do work for everything before classes) and generally enjoys what they are learning or doing; or can justify that whatever they are doing is for some higher goal. 

2, the type that has some kind of separate life from school, be it in sports, social ventures, volunteering, entrepreneurship, work etc and yet still does well in school due to good time management.

1 and 2 are possibly the same person

3, the type that has some kind of separate life from school, be it in sports, social ventures, volunteering etc. Maybe even gaming. However, 3 tends to engage in what society, studies, and ""experts"" call ""bad habits"". These include partying to 6am and going for 8am classes. Gaming till 11pm and submitting an assignment due 12midnight. Working on their businesses and largely ignoring their part in a group project until the deadline. 

Maybe 3 has some exaggerations but you get the idea. I'm sure we have met these 3 types before (top students are basically those FCH dean list like that) but don't you think its interesting that type 3 can be the top despite their ""bad habits"" be it in sleeping, exercise, diet, priorities etc.? 

Its as if they had to self limit to not outperform themselves in school. If they adopted 1 or 2 they might easily get CAP 5, find school boring, and go insane by the futility of it all"

60070,"I am the #59974 author. 

Thank you all very much for your views. I hope I did not come across as salty - maybe I am just FOMO. I was just hoping for some good comments. It is great that there are people who are receiving help - and also sad that there are many left behind. 

Perhaps the reason why we see so many help groups which accentuate gender and racial lines is because the discrimination and harassment has created a common 'experience' which they all can learn to overcome together.  But I am also of the opinion that everyone (from other demographics) should be open and learn about these because it does take two or more hands to clap assuming minds are open. 

In the end, I feel in any power dynamic situation as long as one demographic has majority control there is probably going to be some form of inherent discrimination (which is pretty much clear in many places regardless of which gender or race is on top of that power dynamic). How do we - as a diverse hodge podge of gender race religion socioeconomic classes  - prevent the propagation of this phenomenon?

60059,"so i have a childhood friend (known her for more than 12 years) and as i recall her from secondary school, she used to be a very timid, naive, soft spoken & sweet girl-next-door type of person. recently, i met up with her and i couldn’t find her at our meeting place. instead of the girl i remember, i was greeted by a completely different girl with dyed hair and tons of piercings all over her body. she was dressed more revealingly and carried herself more confidently, but she also spoke very loudly and crudely. i was happy about her newfound confidence, and decided to stop judging her for her appearance. however, as we walked and talked, i noticed her smoking cigarettes too. on top of that, when we went to a coffee shop for lunch, she ordered a beer. in the afternoon. 

i heard rumours that her parents went through quite a messy divorce a few years back, but i never expected her to change so drastically. i, on the other hand, am pretty much your typical guaikia who stays at home on friday nights watching netflix. 

some might say, stop judging her for her new self, but i feel like she doesn’t seem very happy now living her new lifestyle, and she is constantly seeking a father figure after her dad walked out of her life. i feel like i don’t know my friend anymore, and i don’t know how to help her either. i’m at such a loss"
60055,"My parents, aunts, and uncles are super out-of-touch. They believe that I should be getting paid a lot just because I have a degree. I've told them that I would definitely not get paid as much as they think I should be. I don't think there are many employers who would pay someone with 0 work experience so much money. It makes me so angry that they don't understand how the world has changed. A degree doesn't guarantee a job. It can help, but there is more to that. I believe that employers are looking for people who are passionate about what they do, good work attitude, and a record of being able to get things done etc.

60052,"As a final year student, after so many years of education, I have come to a realisation that the capability of student is mainly dependent on the ability of teachers transferring the knowledge of the subject well. Coming from neighbourhood primary and secondary schools, my results have been average for PSLE and O levels. However, upon entering SP and NUS, with lecturers and professors with relatively higher education and experiences as compared to primary and secondary school teachers, I have managed to learn and understand the subjects better which allowed me to achieve FCH and Dean's List for these few years in NUS. 

As such, what I am trying to imply is that parents should not be worried about whether streaming or non-streaming is better for their kids. But instead, be concerned more about the quality of teaching, which is highly dependent on the school's educators.

This post is with regards to the recent hooha about the secondary streaming system.

60051,"I'm the author of #59970. I was just asking for an opinion because I was genuinely afraid he might be a pervert or something. Honestly, I was shocked by the comments, some of which were quite mean (it's funny that the mean comments were from guys lol). Ok, I did not know that FBT was army attire. But that was 20 years ago. Today, they're considered women's clothing so he shouldn't have worn it in public, since it may give the wrong ideas. There's a reason why normal guys don't wear FBT in public (I'm talking about the curve cut kind). Anyway, I've told my girl friends to just be cautious about their clothes and to keep an eye on him. It's better to be safe than sorry. I think guys in particular shouldn't comment so much, since y'all will never experience being stalked or having your clothes stolen by a pervert."

60045,"I was the one who wrote the original confession #59879 regarding the debate which sparked on the 60/70-40/30 instead of 50-50 with my fiancé. Thank you for the advice and input from the helpful ones - Eventually, we agreed on a 60-40 arrangement for the wedding/house because backstory is, I have a car which I’m paying by myself (not sharing the loan with him because I needed it for my work) and supporting my parents too while he isn’t. Yes, car is a big ticket item but he is working in an office job so it doesn’t seem fair he chip in for it, because we only use it over weekends for dates. Guess I missed those out in my previous confession, my output is definitely more even though we’re earning the same range.

60034,"Seeing the recent post about chem majors, low wages, and inflated GES...I'm not a chem major, but it got me thinking about my out-of-touch parents telling me during my break before university ""dont take any (temp) job that pays below $12 an hour, you at least have an A level cert, they should pay you more than that"". I ended up not getting any temp job at all, bc obviously no one wants to pay an A-level kid that much to work a few months. 

Now I'm in uni, and I realize-- if I take the 'true' (or at least close to true) market wages for my major, and divide it by the hours that singaporeans usually work (we overwork so much..) well my hourly wages would be less than $12 an hour. I could go through all these 4 years, graduate with good honors, and get a job that pays so low, my parents think it is beneath 18-year-olds...sigh. 

My mother had nothing but education till sec 4 and some short private courses, worked for only a few years in IT in the 90s, and during that time she made 3k a month...that's like 4k a month today.

I hate to say this but I was really tired of those endless arguments with you and your manipulative ways. I had to end things with you because I needed to save myself. How could you go around telling our friends that I am a moron for dating a poor guy?

Yes you are rich, you landed a prestigious job, you live in a freaking big penthouse and you drive a car that would make people turn heads. But you know what, I was never into all these to begin with. What I loved about you was how you always managed to crack me up with your wicked sense of humour and your endearing support in my darkest days. 

I really appreciate all that you have done for me. But our differences took a toil on us and left me with no choice but to give up on you. Believe it or not, I did love you. I'm sorry that I left you when you were just starting out your new job and needed my support.

I know I was being an ass and I apologise for moving on to someone new quickly. He may not live in a big house or drive a fancy car like you but he's very mature, caring and supportive. He may be just a poor student but he's willing to save up to get the best things he could for my birthday. 

It really doesn't matter how much you earn or how much money you have. All I want is just someone who can love me wholeheartedly.

60029,"I’ve been dating this girl who is smart, pretty and comes from a wealthy family. As a guy who’s from an average family, I am worried about dating her for I fear I cannot keep up with her lifestyle or expectations. 

I never really seeked extravagence in this life, I am a person happy living a normal life, getting a HDB and maybe owning a simple car. If I ever became wealthy, I would still want to live a humble life for I am not into the high SES stuff. The problem is a life together with her in the future, I am worried about not being able to provide her nice things and because of that I feel inadequete in many ways. For someone who is used to living in luxury, can they truly accept an average life even if they said they’re fine?

She’s a sweet girl but she’s someone with little regard for money as she buys stuff without thinking about the cost of it. I’m worried that she’ll spend my hard earned money away in the future and leave me if I am left with nothing. This might be my wild imagination running, but it is a reality that I might end up being in. 

In an idealistic world, love should transcend everything as we accept one another regardless of where they come from. Yet, the practical realities of life tells us otherwise, that wealth and status do matter and it can sometimes trascend love. 

How then should one react to being in such circumstance? Would you date someone like that?

60014,"I have never been this disgusted by the way NUS handles this.

This warning (pictured below) was sent on the SAME day as the deadline, with no prior warning beforehand, not even one week or 3 days in advance. With us students being so focused on the internship (I am also not taking any evening modules, so I'm never in NUS this sem) and doing our best for the company, how are they expecting us to churn out a report out of nowhere?!

Also, like any normal human being, we all tend to forget some stuff and need a bit of reminder beforehand. Instead they are expecting us to do EVERYTHING, asking my supervisor for the required content and churn out a good report in ONE day?! This is ridiculous. It's not even that hard to just tweak the email reminder system to send out another reminder 3 days or 1 week before.

My internship makes me busy enough with many more deadlines and thanks Engineering Internship Department, you don't even give us a link to the guidelines on your submission page and do I look like i have the time to google for it with my busy internship schedule?! Ridiculous. You could had just put the link to your guidelines which is on another website on the submission page.

When I asked my mentor about the guidelines of the report, he simply shot the arrow to the Engineering Internship Department without offering ANY form of assistance. And thanks Engineering Internship Department, accusing me of not taking responsibility as a student. NUS is supposed to at least remind us on these deadlines that are not even within the company. You call this preparing students for the working world?! More like, you are just giving students extra stress from dropping a surprise bomb. My polytechnic interns in my company receive their email to submit their reports earlier than ONE day.

The way my mentor and the Engineering Internship department is handling this is sub-standard and very unprofessional. Obviously they don't understand some internships are much busier than others and they're just having a good time shaking their legs in office and collecting our fees.

60006,"Hello. I am the original author of #59956 - the one regarding splitting finances for wedding. Thank you for all the comments, i am flattered. 

Fun fact - my husband is younger than me by quite a bit (he is not xiao bai lian, dont worry). But that aside, I just want to say such mentality is not rare amongst girls, but rather it needs to be communicated with understanding. Some female dont think that way because the guy partner is already earning enough to pay half or even more. I am just fortunate enough to be able to meet someone from totally different background and put me through this test of going against the society norms. 

Is like if a person earns 10k per month and can afford to buy a Prada bag from the disposable income, why must they settle for a coach bag instead? If the guy partner is earning more or the same, some ladies would naturally feel that it is only right to do 50:50 or guys pay more. I admit i used to think that way when i was with my ex who earns 2k more than me per month. I seriously considered about the monetary part before i even agreed being his girlfriend cause i thought our future would be so difficult..

But because im able to meet my current husband that allows me to gain a total different perspective about being in a relationship and being in love. I know some girls would probably not bother to start a relationship with a guy of such background but i chose to go ahead because I was really in love with him and felt like a little princess being his girlfriend (not with the monetary gifts, but mainly the way we show our love and affection towards each other). Most importantly, our mentality are of the same frequency. Im not afraid to be myself when im with him or hang out with his friends, vice versa. Im happy that im able to see this guy for life..

But the truth is, even for guys or even girls who earn well, it doesnt mean they know how to save up for their future. Some may not even save a single cent only to struggle when they want to settle down. Some proritise expensive hobbies over their future. But mostly just dont communicate and may end up in ""since u guy then u pay more la"" kind of situation cause the girl didnt have that savings ready. The girl at times just expect the guy to be like a magician and show the money. But isnt wedding between two parties who really want to spend the lifetime together? Then all those financial burden should be shared and not one to have more or less (up to each couple's agreement). I know some guys who are really egoistic and say it doesnt make sense for girls to pay so he never wants to settle down when he dont have the money yet. Same - some girls say that they are the one leaving their roof to be with the guy so naturally the guy should pay for wedding.

I dont know what im trying to say and its difficult for me to explain how did the relationship between me and husband could have so much mutual understanding. I guess it's mainly: 

1) we prioritise our love and future over anything else. 

2) we communicate truthfully without hiding how we really feel. 

3) we listen to understand and not to reply. 

4) we plan our life financially as well (ps. We dont go for a lot of dates. Ie. We are not those ""my weekend is automatically with my partner"" kind of couple. We just meet for meals - those we are really hungry and want to eat and not eat for the sake of meeting kind. We just go for some free events to enjoy our time. And definitely, we spend money when necessary!)

5) dont ever feel envy about other people relationship. I have girlfriends who would call of meet up to compare engagement rings. I would give that a miss cause i dont think its worth comparing. Please dont ever take k drama as the norm. 

6) be contented that you found the one. Can you imagine yourself needing to leave him cause of money? If you cant, let go of such money quarrels and go with your feels. "
60005,What are your views on not telling your spouse or significant other the exact amount of savings you have?
60004,"So, what a • b means, depends on the module in question. 

In MA1101R or MA2104, it's the scalar product of two vectors, a and b. In a general maths module, it might mean the multiplication operator on two variables, a and b. In CS2100, it's the AND logical operator. 

I wonder what else that dot is shorthand for."
