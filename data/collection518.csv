Also, although not as important, where to find a list of places in school that sells simple food 24/7? I only know 7-11@YIH and cheers@utown lol.

51888,"Those taking the shuttle bus , kindly move in. You think the bus only got you is it?"
51884,"I don’t know what the future holds. But I feel that we will meet again. And you will again be the person I dare to share my innermost thoughts with. The person I will ‘bully’ occasionally, then afraid that you will actually be mad at me and stop wanting to see me, and say sorry first. The person that I would both feel happy and sad when I think of.

But for now I won’t be selfish. I will let you go. I won’t ask you to stay or guilt trip you. I won’t make you feel like you are still somehow responsible for me. Because I can be soft-hearted when I want to and strong when I need to."

51881,"Many people have told me that I am very skinny and have asked what is my secret in staying slim. The truth is, I’ve always been eating 1 full meal a day since I was in Primary school. I don’t feel hungry when I don’t eat and I snack very often. I know this is not healthy but snacking keeps me happy. I’m also a fussy eater and only my unhealthy junk food keeps me eating happily. When I have to keep eating what I called “proper meals”, it makes me sad and miserable. I tried eating healthily before, but I always give up afterwhile because it doesn’t make me happy."

51874,"To #51849: I feel like I should respond to you since I found out the same thing last year. I had seen my dad's phone and it was a full blown affair. My parents almost divorced, and it was, and still is, a dismal situation at home. I was pissed, sure, but I think what I really felt was fear. I thought about how much it would complicate my relationship with my relatives, siblings, possible future spouse, the stress just kept piling on and on. Sometimes I had to get out of the house for long walks just to catch a breath, to at least jam that crazy train of thought, even to just stop thinking and finally get some sleep. I thought the madness would consume me.

Reality is, that it's going to affect you. If it didn't, wouldn't you be a psychopath? Although it isn't much consolation, I don't really know what I can write to make you feel better. It is what it is, but life must also be what _you_ make of it. Sometimes it felt internally that I was blaming the failures in my life on my parents. But perhaps in this time of desperation, it felt more true that although I did not choose for this to happen to me, the life that was given to me is still mine, and I could choose what I want to do, and how I want to feel. Even if that doesn't makes sense, this nonsensical thought gave me some sense of control, even if to focus on the normal stresses of life.  

In the end my siblings and I confronted my dad, told him we knew, and told him it was wrong. There was more drama but we got through that time, and you will to. I may have looked normal to friends at school but it was a real fight to keep it together, even to this day. It is kind of sad that I see more of these things happening, but perhaps you can find some comfort in the fact that you're not the only one who has been through it. Even if you have no hope, you can be your own hope for a better future. I know you can."

51865,"Sex is my greatest hobby. I think about sex everyday, I look for sex almost everyday, so much so that it is distracting me from my studies and work a lot. I feel that life is dull without sex. I don't look for relationship at all. I'm not satisfied having sex with one person only. Is this normal? This is not a troll. No troll and no ""just chop off"" comment please. 

Should I just give up sex? But I can't really find a convincing reason to. I always have safe sex so I'm clean, I've not done anything illegal. "

51857,"Anyone thinks we should have a weight loss club cca? It's a club cos it's not sports and it's not competitive at all. Anyone can join for like weekly exercise sessions, don't even need a routine, just come tgt and exercise with others who are aiming to lose weight/pia ippt. Can even play different sports every session just for fun. Maybe for those who really want to force themselves, can sign up for the CCA and every week if don't hit quota (maybe 2 sessions) need to donate to CCA fund $1 (unless got valid reason/exam period). Good way to make friends/ relationships and have exercise buddies who can share weight loss/fitness tips. Can even have a telegram group to open jio everyone in the group and maybe have weekly updates on health tips/challenges to complete. Anybody feel me?"
51856,"When Singaporean students go on exchange, the trend is most of them tend to stick among themselves exclusively and are not open to meeting other people. 

My exchange experience allowed me to meet other exchangers from different countries and many of them are top in their field of studies. Most of us still remain good friends and often meet up in various parts of the world. In fact, we have helped each other find high paying jobs with expatriate terms in different parts of the world with some being global HRs and headhunters while some are already in the management level with hiring influence.  

My point is Singaporeans like to talk and focus about networking but when they are given the opportunity to do so on exchange, they don’t seize it because they may think friendships with non-singaporeans are not long-term & difficult to maintain. It might not be the same for everyone but be open to meeting new people because you never know what you can gain from it, be it 5 or 20 years down the road. "
51855,"Need some advice here, I took a sign language class with NUSEnablers last semester and even now I’m still receiving emails and private WA messages from people in this group advertising their classes.

51854,"I used to be a little chubby in primary school but then lost a ton of weight in secondary school. After losing weight, I’ve had people (girls and guys inclusive) coming up to me and telling me that I’m pretty. Throughout secondary school and jc, I was on the more popular end and had my fair share of guys asking me out.

With all this, you’d think I’d be confident of myself, or at least of how I look. The truth is, my self-confidence is at rock bottom and has always been there. My parents are both on the heavier side and I can’t even put to words how afraid I’d yo-yo back to my old weight if I do not watch my diet. 

Ever since I lost weight (some time between Sec 1 - 2), I’ve never eaten a full bowl of rice up till now. If I know I have plans to eat out with my friends the next day, I’d starve the day before. I’m living on campus, and it’s been 3 weeks into the school term, but I’ve yet to eat anything in school. In between breaks, I’d just go to the library and sit down. The only time I eat is when I go back to my room, and the only thing I’ve been eating are plain biscuits. I don’t eat more than 2 packets per day. I’m an athelete and my diet has been taking a toll on me.. I’m burning off more calories than I’m consuming but I just can’t bring myself to eat. When I eat slightly more than what I usually eat, I feel so immensely guilty and fat. I’d literally feel like one lump of fat walking around. This may sound funny - “a lump of walking fat” - but it’s really how I feel. And when I feel that, I hit the gym again and try to burn all those calories off. You guys might not believe this but I’ve come to a point where I feel most at ease when I’m starved.

Maybe you guys might think I’m vain and all but in all honesty I’m just so stressed out over this.. I can’t decide between my health and what I have now. When I was chubbier, I had no friends. Nobody knew I existed. I felt ugly every single time I looked in the mirror then. Now, although my eating habits are shit, people think I’m attractive and I can at least pretend to be confident. Everywhere I go, I am welcomed. People are also generally nicer to me. 

I know I need help and my habits are not healthy... Even so, I doubt I’d ever reach out for help. Just wanted to put this out here because all my friends think that I’m that smart and confident girl who has it all, but in reality, I have zero self-esteem."

I'm not a freshman (yet), but I'll be entering Eng really soon. Wanted to ask why is it that you aren't able to do anything about it? I'm not familiar with the process of IA itself, though I know it's an important stage in our University career.
Forgive me if I appear brash, but I reckon we're able to bring this issue up to the supervisor? Afterall, we're an intern, and not an employee per se, so I believe that'd lead to the likelihood of the consequences being less harsh, if they don't like what we tell them?
Sure, there's a chance they might drop us from their organisation as an intern, but are we not able to find another attachment that'll prove more meaningful?
I mean personally I'm someone who doesn't really take these kinds of BS at work and in life (generally), especially if it has an impact on my future. If the terms in the IA are stated in black and white that I should be doing something more productive, or working with the mentioned department A, then if I'm told to do some of the ""saikang"" crap for a period of time, I wouldn't hesitate to speak to the supervisor about it.

Some nights, no matter how hard I tried, my mind wandered around the empty space caused by your leaving. I didn’t know how significant an impact that a simple text, a hug, a question or just the sight of you after a long, arduous day could  create, until I can no longer take it for granted. In those nights, it took all the strength that I could muster to not break down, give up and admit the defeat. And yet somehow, the next morning, I woke up and went about the day as if I had had a peaceful sleep the previous nights. Truth is, I hardly ever thought about you when I was running back and forth, struggling to keep pace with this way-too-fast life, but that doesn’t mean I don’t need you or don’t want you around.

I may act cold towards you, like you are the enemy. The truth is, I never felt like a friend good enough for you. I made the decision to stop our friendship, yet it hurt me a lot.

All I can say is that I am grateful you came to my life. You approached me, that quiet boy in class, and we became best of friends. We were so different, but we just clicked. You changed me, and without you, I can imagine myself still being that awkward loner boy in class. (Well, the truth is, you also made me slightly more rebellious and noisy.)

The end of our friendship came really swift. I suddenly started avoiding you, and didn't respond when you called my name. I stopped talking to you. Sorry if it confused you. Maybe, I wasn't used to having a friend at that time, and your friendship overwhelmed me. I felt like I didn't deserve you. Nevertheless, you were the most amazing friend anyone could ever ask for. The most amazing friend I've ever had, in fact. The times that we had were short, yet they remain as memories engraved in my heart.

Thank you, for making me the more outspoken guy I am today. We both have our own very amazing cliques. Good luck with uni life!

51817,"I think I have super powers. Not sure if you all have watched Arrival before, but the protagonist ends up with the ability to perceive the future. I think I also can do it, but a much smaller scale. Just by looking at the person, I would have a rough vague idea on the relationship in the future, whether we will be strangers, acquaintance or friends. I am also able to predict my grades with great accuracy and my tutorial balloting results. I sometimes can also know the near future, whether if the bus is coming and if I'm going to bump into someone I know. Currently, I'm working on seeing the future exams questions so I can prepare for them before hand, but it's take a great deal to pin down something so accurate and detail.
