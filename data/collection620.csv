62096,"Hi, with regards to recent case. I, too would like to seek some advice. I'm staying at raffles hall and once, I had a female friend over in my room as we were discussing a project. When we were done, I told her I wanted to shower and she ask me to go ahead and she will see herself out.

After my shower, I thought she would already have left by then, so I only wrapped a towel around my waist and walked back to my room. I went back I was shocked to see her still there. I immediately tried to cover up but she smiled, grabbed my crotch and pulled the towel off. She giggled and spank my ass, then she just winked at me and left.

I was so scared, I wanted to cry. Kind of afraid to tell my hall masters considering I am a guy. That night I went to sleep full of fear and emotion, it was such a traumatizing experience...

Every day since then I would wake up and sit in my corner of my room and cry.

I really dont dare to face her anymore and i feel she should be asked to leave the hall.

Any advice?"
62082,"This message is intended for Monica Baey: 

I want to personally thank you for being so courageous and stepping up to shed light on the situation and how it was handled by the police and NUS. I have read a few comments that are trying to vilify the VICTIM for going public with this case. And it’s comments like these that make it so hard for so many women to come forward following sexual harassment/assaults. Somehow after everything you have already been through people try to justify the perpetrators actions and that is complete BS. They try to take your voice and place blame on you for sharing, and that is absolutely WRONG! 

Luckily most of these demented victim shaming comments are met with many other moral responses condemning the perpetrator and those defending him. 

This must be such a difficult time for you to have to relive the event and experience unwarranted backlash for your willingness to speak up for yourself and challenge a broken system that fails to bring you APPROPRIATE justice as well as REAL action to change the way things are handled in the future cases.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Thank you for your voice, thank you for your courage, and thank you for not giving up and accepting such a lackluster response from the police and the school.

I stand with you Monica. Thank you!!

62066,"I realised im really bad at speaking, and prefer a pure research career, where i can keep quiet and do things in lab over my entire life. Is this realistic in singapore because im not sure can i support myself financially "
62065,"Hi, I'm 32yo (Guy) and been single for 6 years plus, my family is quite complicated due to parents is separated since i was 5yo and never been having a family feel and stress i can never shared last time, i have 3 elder sister but never really in good terms since young, but now i'm 32yo things have been changed in the family slightly better but yet its been hard. 

I myself have diabetes due to family history, 5 years ago i was nearly blind due to my condition and i didn't gave up and change my lifestyle such as going gym, research and eating healthy, then i able to fight through and from 80kg to 63kg currently, no more medication required as i control my sugar intake very strictly and i even went to take up a personal trainer certificate and help others ppl facing problem like me last time. 

I have lots of scar on me and not really good looking, i have tried many ways to know new girls such as tinder or etc... for the past 3 years i have tried quite hard in searching my partners but never got one, i gave up last year on using such app as i got hurt really bad from many ppl in the app, i have tried 2 ways, one is telling the truth in my profile of my illness and 2nd is not telling them, my friend advice me not to tell first and try to know girls first and then slowly tell them the truth. but in my heart i felt bad for not telling but yet i tried my friend advice, so.... after some of the girls that i manage to stay in touch in the app and continue chatting, i told them about my illness and family background, they straight away not talking to me anymore. But some yes, they did replied me and they sort of tell me they are just looking for friends to tell in a way to reject me, some even told me (Why would i choose a unhealthy one where i can find a healthy and good looking one) this is where i got hurt that bad and gave up. 

Recently i had a trip with my company colleagues, there's a girl actually i interested in but i know she got attached recently and therefore i tried not to go near her although i felt a connection, i told myself again the reality i am facing, why would she want to be with me even she is not attached. I am not tall, handsome nor well live off, with illness and probably can't have child due to my illness that had made me very low sperm count and also i don't want to pass down my illness to my spouse although i wish to have a family. I am really sad but i can't achieve anything as simple as a relationship. 

In my life i only had 1 relationship where i did not turn out well, i really do love my partners if i still able to find some one i like and of course she like me too (even she does not), i will always try my best for her.

Thanks NUSWhispers for having such page for sharing people story, if not i can't find a place to share. 

Appreciate if real people can talk to me regarding such situation i facing in my life."
62063,"Er yeah would just like to give my opinion on the whole Baey issue. I think the real issue is that the punishment meted out and the expectation for punishment is different, leading to some kind of injustice felt by Monica and consequently the general public. While we should assume that the related institutions have worked SUFFICIENTLY (in their own understanding) to analyze this issue, that is not to say that these institutions have done ENOUGH (in the eyes of the public) to pursue this matter. That being said, as the laymen (i.e. general public) have no understanding of the logic behind the punishment that was meted out nor the actual ""who's in charge of this situation"", perhaps it would be better for the institutions themselves to come out and make things clearer for everyone. While this may not be sufficient, it would be a good first step towards resolving the issue.

Also, I wouldn't condone witch-hunting, but the fact that this sort of vigilantism and retributive justice is rampant just reflects the larger social issue: that many (or maybe a small but vocal group? But judging by the support this is gaining I'd go with larger group) of the public have lost confidence in the system to be taking matters into their own hands. Maybe the institutions should be working towards restoring this ""loss of trust"" instead of merely telling everyone that ""WiTcH HuNtS aRe BaD"" because everyone knows that anyway, they do it because they empathize with the injustice felt.

tl;dr Bigger issues at hand that needs to be resolved before these issues can be put to rest."
62060,"With regards to the recent saga. How about we take a step back and look at what has the NUS committee done for past similar cases. Maybe nothing has been done. Maybe things has been implemented, but not enough. Maybe the punishment has always been just suspension from studies for a period of time, that's why people felt that its worth the risk to carry out this atrocious act while being a full-time undergraduate? 
Stop blaming Monica, she must have been very desperate to do this on a social media as mentioned that the authorities have all turned a blind eye on her. It takes a lot of courage expose oneself to the public. Also, let's hope that Nicholas is really repenting on his actions while being suspended, maybe doing some volunteering work or charity, and not doing internship at some reputable company to build up his portfolio as I seen on the internet. "
62059,"I am the OP of #61988 and I am responding to Sage Stark's post which follows: ""Please forgive someone if he peep at your daughter next time and all the school did was 12 months warning and a letter of apology given to your daughter. Please forgive me for typing this as well. =)""

I should not be the person to forgive the perpetrator. If my daughter is of similar age as the victim in question, then it will be up to my daughter, whom I expect to possess sufficient maturity by that age, to decide on her own. 

I would hope that my daughter can have the magnanimity to forgive and have the strength to cast aside all the negative emotions generated from the incident and move on to achieve greater things in her life instead of having any one particular negative incident define any part of her life.

However, I will not push her to accept or reject the apology as it must be her choice alone (assuming she is already mature enough). I can only counsel or guide as her father. 

Lastly, I do accept your apology too, whether heartfelt or not =)"
62048,"Hi #61943, 

I've been in an LDR for ~3 years myself, and I can relate to the worries in your post. 

For me, the most important thing was to communicate. Try to be honest with each other, and be upfront about your individual expectations. For example, you said ""I feel that if a person really matters to me, I will still find time everyday to talk to her..."" Does she know you think this? It also sounds like you weren't officially in a relationship before she left. Would you be hurt if she decided to date someone while overseas, and vice versa? Try talking it out with her, and see if her expectations of the relationship match with yours. 

If you both decide to go ahead with the LDR, here are some tips: 
- Arrange visits if you can. It really helps to know when you'll see each other again; even better if you know the final deadline of the LDR when you'll be together. It's nice to take turns to visit, but if not then discuss it openly, don't let flights/money become a sore point. 
- About flights: Google Flights is great, in particular for tracking flight prices. It's best to buy from the airline directly; avoid fishy-looking third parties. If you plan to fly frequently, look for card rebates, discounts, points etc. 
- If money is a problem but you're determined, this is a chance to get resourceful. Part-time jobs can help (NUS has some). 
- Make sure to continue living your life while apart. You'll have more interesting things to share when you message or meet up. If you can, do something fun/creative with the messages and calls, or try snail mail :)  

If something doesn't work out, it's okay to agree to separate, and try again if in future you're both single and in the same place. Good luck!

62041,"One of the posts stating that the perpetrator was doing his ""internship attachment"" is false. Chemical Engineers need to do an industrial attachment to fulfil their modular credits for graduation but this is a module itself from NUS and was not taken by the perpetrator. He did his own out sourced internship that had nothing to do with NUS. Don't take everything the victim says at face value. What does she want him to do, stone and sit in the room or learn his lesson and make the best of the situation?  "
62039,"People have defended both the victim and perp in the recent saga. But I'm just thankful that Monica spoke up and NUS is actually taking a step (although we dk what's gonna come out of it yet) by setting up a committee. Just look at the past cases in the link and you'll realise that the punishment meted out is actually quite similar to past cases. But because no one has kicked up such a big saga that NUS felt the need to do something about it, every past case has been swept under the rug. At least we're one step in the right direction (hopefully).

62037,"those guys that commenting Monica was trying to get fame or attention, i would like to know your view WHAT IF it was your gf/wife or even someone daughter in Monica shoe, how will you handle the situation? will you ask her to remain silent and move on while she quietly suffer mentally or will you stand up for her and support to get the peeping guy punish?"
62035,"Having Ms Baey incident gone viral, people are starting to take a twist on their stand, commenting that the vigilante was inappropriate. But if it wasn't that this incident gone viral, this case could have been swept under the carpet. Remember that the social media effect only started after the case was officially close, and us as public knowing how the school and SPF have handled the case was not serious enough, and that the public feel unjust of the outcome is when attacking of Nicholas started."
62030,"After I broke up with my first gf of 5 years 2 years ago, I have been feeling really empty on the inside. I am pretty good looking, I would say I am generally funny, and a pretty high achiever, so it's really no problem for me to get a girl interested in dating me. I have been dating around for the past two years and all those relationships turned out to be more like a Fwb relationship than a real relationship. The 3 girls that I have dated after my first all seem to drop interest in me when I start asking them serious relationship question like ""where do you see us moving on from here?"". The first few dates would always turn out to be good and eventually it would lead to sex, but whenever I try to move beyond sex the girl will start to drop interest and eventually siam me.  It really makes me wonder what is wrong with me. Is it the way I am dating them or is it just the kind of girls I am dating. "
62029,"To be honest I think OnHand Agrarian is just doing it out of anger for the perpetrator. I mean yes, change is necessary, the punishment was too light, but is expelling the student and making him lose his job really the best way to punish a pervert? How about more psychiatric help? Do you know what kind of man is the scariest? Someone that has nothing to lose. So if you strip everything away from him. Obviously, his reputation is gone, then you take away his education (left with A level cert), his job. What kind of man will he be, left in the society with nothing? And btw, he is a student on financial aid, you're essentially forcing him into desperation.

I support Monica because of what she is fighting for - more measures and support (mandatory moral education, lol, better bathing protective facilities) in residences to prevent further incidences, mental and physical support for victims of this heinous crime, even a harsher sentence for Nicholas, but expulsion is just too much, especially if NUS does it out of the pressures from another company? 

Please people, when you support the campaign, I hope you are supporting the cause for more change and a safer environment for our students and not supporting it out of hate for Nicholas, and choosing to disgrace him. "
62022,"I would just like to raise some points on Monica’s incident.

I am not in any ways affiliated to Nicholas, and neither am I supporting his actions. However, looking at some of the debates circulating on social media sites, I would like to opinionate from a fairer perspective. What has happened to Monica was indeed unfortunate, and I’m sure many of us, including myself, are sorry for her being a victim to a sexual predator. What Nicholas did was simply not tolerable in our society. However, Monica’s actions are not something we should proud of either and we should not be activists of an issue that we are not clear about.

NUS is not a disciplinary body. Yes, the institution has statutes governing disciplinary actions related to sexual assaults (Statute 6, Clause 3, Circumstance I). I believe NUS actions were appropriate. The institution referred the case to the Police, and it was the Investigation Officer who recommended to Monica to approach NUS should she have any qualms with the disciplinary verdict. The 12-month conditional sentencing was met out by the Police, not NUS. NUS gave Nicholas a semester ban and as an institution, it was a clear sign that NUS wanted to give perpetrators a second chance, regardless whether one is an existing student or a potential criminal. Monica’s actions seemed to be pushing NUS to a corner to have the perpetrator expelled, by condemning NUS and Nicholas publicly on social media. Is this really the right thing to do?

Many of us are narrow-minded. One day we will be a parent ourselves. If one of our children does something wrong, and the victim condemns him or her publicly, and wants him or her expelled or dismissed from an organization, taking off his or her entire livelihood, would you support the public’s move or stand up for your own child? Similarly, if our own children are victims, I believe we must be more open-minded because everybody deserves a second chance. Punish appropriately and support rightfully. I was once preyed on by a sexual predator, but I did not condemn the perpetrator in public and I moved on from my own experience. I believe there are many victims out there who has dealt with their own experiences, so there is no reason as to why Monica must handle her issue in such a manner by putting NUS and the perpetrator in such a difficult position.

Monica’s attitude does not sit well with me, I’ll be honest. Yes, her public shaming methods was to garner support, but lately her posts have put across a message that she was enjoying the public attention from the entire incident. Her behavior in the posts does not justify her emotional distress.

Also, many are raising talking points on women rights and protecting women. I would like to make it clear that not only women are prey to sexual predators but men as well. Before many of you go on a social media rant about how women should be better protected, think again. Everyone should be protected, regardless of gender.

Once again, what Nicholas does is intolerable and should be severely punished. But what Monica did was also not something that people should be proud of. There is no wrong being sympathetic, but are you sure what she is doing is morally correct? 

Raise your support in the right way. "
62021,"I only have 3 points to make about all this:
1. Why are things in Singapore in such a way that if a serious crime occurs within a NUS compound it more often than not goes through the Board of Discipline instead of directly investigated by the police (which should have been the case for the more serious incidents during several O'Camps in 2016)?
2. To those who allege and assert that she is just seeking attention, think about this: If she did not speak up as with all other previous victims, this would go on and on and nobody would ever know the truth of what really happens. In fact those people making allegations are the ones seeking attention for themselves by discrediting her and supporters in any means possible.
3. It was never about targeting a certain individual, it was about bringing real changes to NUS. I am worried that some students are becoming extremely myopic about this."
62019,"Amidst the uproar about the voyeurism saga, perhaps it would be nice for us as a community to exhibit some empathy. 

Yes, we all have our own skepticism and personal nuances towards the perpetrator or the victim. However, I wish to invite everyone to think deeply about how each of the parties involved would feel from their points of view before attempting to make a post. What the parties involved decide on going public is solely their own discretion and could very well be things which are sensitive to them. Do not forget, beneath this cloak of anonymity (NUSWhispers) is the very vulnerability which each and every one of us are afraid to show everyone (i.e. our privacy). As a rule of thumb, if you would say the same thing to the whole community in real life as you are about to do so on NUSWhispers, you're good.

From the victim's POV, comments like ""milking it for the fame and enjoying it"", ""she should be a decent human being and stop the witch hunting and mob lynching now with all the news she’s getting"" and ""she did not need to target Nicholas specifically"" are all things which may further injure the victim and pretty much uncalled for. Think about it, if you were the girl being filmed, regardless of whether you want attention, you would certainly be feeling stressed out, helpless and weakness from all the trauma and pressure you've been through. In an assured position of weakness, do these comments help alleviate or at least empathise with the pain you have been through? 

From the position of the need for attention, what does a few thousand more followers have over the fact that you have given away your position of vulnerability? From this aspect, I respect the victim's courage in speaking up for herself for something so personal and sensitive to her.

From the perpetrator's POV, comments like ""he deserves everything that has happened"" is really not for us to say. You may disagree with his actions, but are you sure you are objective enough to see all the relevant facts and make a verdict on his punishment? If not, as many have said, your comments could drive him to his ends. Perhaps you think as a victim, he deserves no sympathy. I then invite you to think again, are you objective enough to decide who deserves sympathy? If not, do not add to the fire. You may think your comments are a mere reflection of everyone's opinion and therefore fits in, or on the other end of the spectrum, insignificant enough to cause much damage. Allow me to impress upon you, however, that words are powerful and they slice in the slightest ways you fail to imagine.

One more thing to note, most of us agree that there has to be some form of improvement to the system or precautionary measures being put in place. If you really think you have a good idea to improve the system, do highlight through the proper channels. You might think that they do not listen, but they certainly would not if you post here. 

TL;DR: Please post with empathy and responsibly. Keep your comments to yourself if you have to. If you have a good suggestion to improve the system, highlight through the proper channels."
62018,"Saga related: who feels that the punishment is light?

Spf can do better like jailing and nus can expel the student. 

Can Spf and nus charge/sue the victim for fake news and allegations if it is indeed fake? Why haven't they done so?

The victim's ig post is most likely due to her IO asked her to press nus for further charge but obviously the punishments aren't heavy enough. "
62017,"For those out there saying that’s Monica’s trying to get followers or be famous by exposing the whole story. Please use your brain. If I wanted to get so many followers or be an influencer, wouldn’t it be faster if I just leak my own nudes ??? ???? go create this whole saga for what "
62014,"This entire Baey saga... It's as if media have nothing better to talk about. Surely enough that the perps need to be dealt harshly, but resorting to vigilante acts to call out on NUS and perps is getting out of hand.

Despite that, perhaps she might have done the right thing. From this, we can come to one common conclusion: this lady has exposed how NUS treat  important matter concerning students and its welfare with such leniency. How to place trust in NUS' governing body when they could not provide us students with the security that we need to live our student life with peace of mind, be it in and out of hall?

My assumption is that NUS knows no matter what, as students we wouldn't even think of dropping out of NUS even when our rights are violated because we see value in the precious paper they brand us with. A simple hush-hush was enough to sweep the matter under the rug, thinking student's life will just go on as we grind and mug, drowning in paper chase. 

It's just sad when university sees student as cash cow to propel their so-called ""world class research centre""."
62013,"Disclaimer: I'm not condoning the Accused's actions and behaviour. But I believe that the outcome is at the minimum procedurally fair (I leave open the question as to whether it is morally fair).
This post seeks to state that the process was complied with. Perhaps moving forward, the university has the discretion to mandate harsher punishment. (Note that I say moving forward and not for the current case).

Some of you are saying that the police/prosecution was lenient etc etc etc.
But what if I told you that as this is the Accused's first offence, the prosecution/police has the discretion to let the Accused go with a warning?
Now some of you might argue that this is 'unfair'. My counter to this is that the prosecution/police has good reasons to issue the Accused a warning. The prosecution/police not only have the information and evidence, but are also responsible for crime control etc. They came to this decision having taken into account all relevant  considerations.
Now some of you might also argue that prosecutorial discretion is subjected to review as all powers have legal limits. Ramalingam (SGCA 2011) states that prosecutorial discretion is subjected to review where (1) there is an allegation of bad faith; (2) exercise of the discretion contravenes a constitutionally guaranteed right. 
But in my opinion, it is hard to prove that there is bad faith in the current case and I do not see any contravention of a constitutional right.
Now, some of you might argue that that nonetheless the punishment was too lax. But this is not something the police/prosecution can control. Only parliament has the power to change the punishment etc...

Moving on to the jurisdiction of NUS. In my opinion, the courts system is responsible for penal cases and decision and not NUS. I think that the jurisdiction of NUS should and must be separate and that the Board of Discipline should serve the specific purpose of ensuring student discipline. I also think that a student should not be punished twice for the same offence and that in this case, punishment was meted out.
Nonetheless, some of you might argue that the punishment meted out in this case was too lenient. NUS can update its regulation, but case is closed on the current case.
I would also venture to suggest that NUS is rightly concerned about its reputation in the current case. Punishment was meted out to the Accused and thus, the case is closed. Moreover, I would like to suggest that the Victim herself breached confidentiality by coming out in the first place. I may or may not come back to this later.

Now I would like to move on to the decision. I'm only concerned that the procedure was followed and in this case, the procedure was clearly followed. Which means that if anyone wants to complain, they have to allege some form of procedural unfairness. This is a high threshold to meet and I don't think it will work.
Moreover, I doubt that the victim herself can appeal as she does not have locus standi (In the courts, or in the Disciplinary Board)

Concluding thoughts: Res Judicata. 
Also, the whole situation is completed according to the process. Justice was done in the present case (whether you like it or not). I do understand the outroar over this, but please, NUS can only change the rules for future cases and not for the current case. NUS is also doing so by convening a committee to review the rules.
The petition has served its purpose - awareness was raised, and NUS is trying to solve the problem.
(Although I saw a post somewhere which states that NUS' punishment framework is consistent with the other universities both locally and worldwide)

Back to preparing for Finals."
62012,"There are some things here which have surprised me over these days, and I would like or raise several issues and thoughts. The whole issue has indeed shown me the state we as a society are in today.

Let me start off by saying that this post (or I believe any post) does not condone the actions of the perpetrator. What he did was explicitly wrong in any sane mind, or in any universe. 

One thing I do not understand however, is the need to blame NUS for the whole issue. The NUS disciplinary board and the AGC are 2 completely separate bodies. The former is an educational institution while the later holds the right to charge offending parties. Traditionally, when acts of criminal nature are committed, the AGC has the final right to decide what the appropriate punishment should be. This is where the search for criminal justice ends, as the prosecutor has decided whether they wish to pursue the matter further and bring it to court. If you are unhappy with the decision, go to the AGC and the police to revisit the case. The ""victim"" claims that the investigating officer (IO) told her to seek ""harsher punishment"" from the school. If this is true, the IO also made a mistake here as NUS simply does not have the authority to exert criminal justice.

NUS is an educational institution. Its rule and punishments primarily revolve around academia and protecting its academic integrity. We are no longer in primary school, where talking back to a teacher warrants public caning. Decide to plagiarise other's research or falsify your data? Then yes, NUS might expel you. Why is it like this? Its because the AGC and NUS disciplinary board serve 2 different functions. The NUS disciplinary body is not and should not be a replacement for the criminal justice system.

And please guys, we're all in university.  I thought that it was finally a place where we could have nice discussions on how to improve the system, listen to nicely phrased arguments without emotion taking a centrestage all our arguments. However, what we're seeing here are comments we can also see in the Straits Times comment sections. Rational arguments are now considered to be the politically incorrect thing to do, and hence do not appear much. This is because any viewpoint (just like in the ST comments) with a slight deviation from the norm would be met with responses like ""if its your mother or sister..."". This slightly intrigues me as it seems to blame the opinion for being wrong per se, instead of trying to have a reasonable discussion like young adults. There is a clear difference in the way some of you phrase your arguments, and well the quality of discussion in other faculties.

Last thing, y'all are a painful reminder of why online vigilantism should never be condoned. 
Don't like the punishment? Please go to the relevant authorities. To those of you harassing the guy involved, don't give us the shit that ""if he didn't want to be harassed, don't do it in the first place"". You have dragged innocent parties into the mix as collaterals, and that is simply unfair to them. To paint a mental analogy in your mind, you're like a big-sized Batman speaking Singlish.

Im sure I'll get a lot of flack for holding a view which is not the same as yours. I phrased this with the mindset that I would be talking to a bunch of Straits Times commenters, but I do hope you all will forgive me if a small detail of my argument does not agree with yours.
