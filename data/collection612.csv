I may have been forgotten (for good reason, I'd think), but I used to fold paper flowers and draw on whiteboards, if it's any clue.

I don't have facebook or anything, so... here I am, I guess.

In the end, I just asked my seniors and most of them didn’t go for exchange because we can’t map the mods from our 2 faculties.

Whenever I close my eyes, I’ll imagine monsters and ghosts standing by the bedside and touching my feet. I’ll get spooked if I hear weird sounds which I immediately attribute to them. Turning on music doesn’t help since it will keep me even more awake. It torments me a lot. I know ghosts won’t hurt me but just the thought of them being in the same physical space as me disconcerts me. 

My friends say it has got to do with childhood trauma eg watching horror shows that stick in the mind. I don’t watch those shows to begin with. I only rmb reading a news article about a severed head hung on a tree near my house when I was in p4. Ever since then, I tend to imagine things a lot. 

Some kind souls have suggested that I go for ESMR therapy or even getting a dog but having pets is too much work.

What is your advice ? No trolls please thank you. I wish that someone could change my thinking. I wish there’s a Eureka moment that says ‘Hey, they’re nothing to be scared of because .....’

My work is not hard per say, but requires an amount of specialist knowledge that cannot be gained in school/self research. 
Recently, I have found myself dreading to go to work, and have been questioning why. Here's what i came up with:
1) I don't find my work meaningful. All i do is send emails everyday and/or do reviews. I wanted to do something that makes a difference, like helping people, contributing to SG in a direct way etc.
2)I was just recently posted to my current location a few month ago. My upper study is a terrible teacher that cant teach for nuts. Her method is basically to ask me to read pages and pages of manuals/contracts/SOP, and when you ask a question, her first reaction is 'I thought you read already?' The worst thing is I can only learn from her since she has the specialized knowledge.

61217,"This post is with regards with recent 'discussion' regarding women's choice of clothing, sexual crimes and attitudes towards them.

I feel that everybody, men or women, has their own opinion on this matter. On one end, there are people who believe that women should dress modestly to protect themselves from being targeted by sexual predators (not victim-blaming, just for precaution), and the opposing group who believes that women should wear however they want and not be subjected to fear of sexual crimes. But I feel that things are not as black and white as these may seem.

I propose that everybody has a comfort zone between (and including) these stances (kinda like a slider). If you are very afraid of sexual predators, wrap yourself like a pochong. If you value your freedom of expression of style, feel free to dress however you want. I don't understand why external parties want to impose additional (negative) values to people who disagree with them.

61209,"hi again im the op of #61151

I thank those who have raised good points for discussion and will duly ignore the rest because class part is not assessed here.

The very purpose of my post was to set up some basis of moral evaluation so good job everyone that pointed that I'm being fairly idealistic. However, on the topic of precaution which extends to basic acts like locking your car door etc etc, I've come to understand why some of you pin the same amount of blame on a robber and negligent car owner. You can't trust anyone to not steal your car after all - that's fair and valid. If someone puts $100 on a table in clb and it gets stolen, even me, the MoRaL iDeAliSt would find it stupid that you'd even do that in the first place

But we're talking about basic ethics here - maybe DON'T steal or r*pe etc etc etc. Granted, I'll edit my previous stance: if you walk out on the streets with a sign saying please stab me vs if someone stabs you because you were just walking around (yes i'm avoiding talking about r*pe), an instinctual response that ""oh you were literally?? asking to be stabbed??"" is warranted. That being said, we (or rather only some of us, judging by the comments) DO recognize the act of murder is inherently wrong.

I still stand by my take that victim-blaming is CLEARLY wrong, but I will add the nuance that we need to identify the aggressor as such first. If just because someone's stupid or ignorant, they deserve to be attacked/harassed/exploited, rip the comments section. Sidenote: it's pretty sad if you need to respond with an edgy kindergarten level reeeeeeeeead - I sincerely thank those who genuinely thought about the issue and responded, regardless of what your stance was/is."

61206,"Hi all,

I'm an NUS undergrad, whose faculty does not comment on NUSWhispers often (always studying). My seniors are way too busy and don't come to school most of the time so they don't really read this page. But I do read this page for entertainment sake and let me say that I really love this page. The thought processes and reasoning evident by the unique netizens in the comment section here is well... unique. Needless to say, it is very different from the opinions and arguments which my faculty mates and I have (by many many many miles).

In my faculty, brains and critical thinking are a must if I want to communicate effectively with my peers, and not receive those judgemental ""what are you talking about"" eyes.
Here, it seems that the same method of argument does not apply! If the amygdala hijack mechanism taught briefly in school needs a prime example, most of the netizens here would be it.

Personally, the comments here are like a break from work. In school, I analyse different problems and pains people face, and how I could better help them when they consult me. But here, I look at the arguments/advice posed by netizens, and try to reason out these thought processes.

Let me tell you, the latter is undoubtedly more puzzling, albeit infinitely more entertaining.

Go ahead, criticise my imperfect enGRISH.

Regards.
