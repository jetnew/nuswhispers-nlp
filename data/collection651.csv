65199,"So my ex and I broke off earlier this year and right after our breakup, I decided to go on tinder and got to know this person. It was going fine and we met and stuff but recently when I saw my ex going out with another person, all the wasted emotions and energy spent on my ex just took a toll and I felt like I am now seeing this new person as a rebound. Obviously, there is some heartache from the previous relationship and I feel that it's not fair to the new one that I am still harbouring feelings from the previous. How do I eventually move on and be happy with the current one?"
65197,"Can any senior who has joined share your experience, please? I'm a freshman. Trying to look for advice if the O'week orientation camps are worth joining. What do they usually do? What happens during the camp? Will I ""Loose out"" for not joining?"
65195,"Hey OP #65195.

I had to take down my initial comment because my family wanted confidentiality/privacy.

Just wanna share my experience with sharing my house keys with an outsider. I can't recall all the details as this was roughly 10 years ago when I was in high school (international school in Singapore).

I actually got to know a boy through a unofficial mentorship between myself and a ""problematic hormonal teenager"" two years my junior. I thought it was no big deal because I was taught sex education and consent while I was abroad. Boy was I wrong.

Anyways I met this boy and fell for him, and he asked for my house keys in exchange for a romantic relationship. Being young and reckless, I passed him my house keys.

Some nights I would wake up without warning getting penetrated by my ""back door"". I was lost and disoriented for my final year in IB and started getting anxiety attacks. I was projected to score a 41, but ended up with 38.

Now when I look online I see videos that may have been my younger self with this boy... Thank goodness my face was not in any of the videos. I still suffer from occasional anxiety today, especially when I get reminded of what had conspired.

Please reconsider giving away your house keys to someone you hardly know, even if you think you feel so deeply about them. Protect yourself and your family. The world is not a fairy tale."
65194,"Everywhere I see in uni everyone experiencing their youth, being in a relationship, casual sex, etc.. It makes me feel like crap knowing that everyone around me has experienced many things, yet I am a 25 year old guy, about to graduate, yet I have not dated anyone nor have I lost my virginity. Is it bad that I am still alone right now and haven't done anyone of those. I feel like I am losing out."
65193,"Please would like someone to explain this to me. 

On the one hand, we read the GES for the local unis and see that average salary across different courses is ~3.5k. And even places like the civil service, MOE, etc. do 3.8k, 4k+. More if SAF even. Not to mention everyone knows about all those crazy tech/banking jobs just crazy. So clearly lots of ppl doing well.

Yet we have a lot of other confessions also about taking jobs under 3k, many news articles in Straits Times, etc. And anecdotal evidence from friends I'm sure we all have, if you're actually from NUS etc., about how hard it is to find a job etc. Lots of commenters on recent NUSWhispers threads, other local forums also about strawberry generation etc, local grads must be willing to take 2k, etc.

So who's right here? How hard is the job market? How bad is it actually? What is the reasonable expectation here? I'm grad next year and I'm just trying to figure out what is a reasonable standard for me to expect. Is it really strawberry gen to expect the GES values or? If it helps I' a fairly solid second uppers at the moment with one internship under my belt (that I'm doing right now). tia."
65191,"I have always been by myself but last year, due to circumstances, I managed to get myself into a clique. But again, due to issues, I broke off my ties with the clique. I'm fine most of the time, when I'm busy and occupied . But occasionally, I'll feel lonely, especially when I see the clique hanging out together. I know it's my own choice and I don't regret it, but I can't help but feeling lonely sometimes."
65190,"I (20F) met a guy (20M) on tinder recently and he seems like a really nice guy, really sweet. I'm still trying to see if he really likes me or is just desperate,because this is going to be my first serious rs. Got my feelings played too many times and I'm deathly afraid of getting into any rs.

The problem is that I'm going to uni this year while he's only a nitec grad. I'm afraid of stepping into a relationship with him partly because my parents are really traditional and insist that I should find a bf in uni. He said that he's going to sign on with the air force either as an officer or sergeant (I have no idea what the differences are) and ultimately his goal is to get a degree, though he will take much, much longer. How do I go about convincing my parents if we were to really get together? Please help:("
65189,"Dear OP of #65211, you really have no right to shame others for not being virgins. We all choose which set of values to follow and last time I checked, there was no absolute set we must all abide by. People complained about #65189 because the OP's girlfriend doesn't deserve to be looked down upon by her partner - nobody deserves that, it's a sure recipe for failure and it has a lot of potential for trauma too.

If virginity is important to you, please look for a virgin partner without insulting people with different opinions. I would advise being clear about it from the start to avoid disappointment for both you and the other party. After all, we live in the 21st century where people have pre-marital sex on a regular basis, and usually, the first relationship one has doesn't last forever. I'll take the opportunity to highlight that as you grow older, your options will most likely reduce to unattractive people (who couldn't find a partner earlier) or very late bloomers.

Lastly, do consider you too could end up a non-virgin at the end of a relationship, so don't be too hard on yourself if that happens! In the meantime, you could show some compassion for the people who weren't lucky enough to get it right on their first try."
65188,"My girlfriend is really dramatic sometimes, she always says that her life is over and complains at the smallest inconvenience such as being tired. And due to this she gets into a bad mood and takes t out in me, and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time from fear of setting her off. 

What do?"
65187,"#65187 I think more importantly food prices in NUS is becoming a big problem. I've been tracking my food expenses and noticed a jump in prices in UTown Fine Food since the 1st round of renovation. Not very significant to some but for those who spend an entire sem of lectures/tutorials in UTown the general cost of ""eating"" was already 1.5-1.8× compared to anywhere else in NUS. And then in Engin since Techno closed food prices has almost doubled - gone were the days we could settle on a meal for $2.80-3.20 and instead many of the popup stalls are selling at least $4.50 and above. Now that more canteens are closing I'm concerned that the situation is getting much worse."
65185,"I'm concerned about a friend. I've known him for quite a while. He's typically a very quiet, reserved and frugal person. 

But over the last 2 weeks, it seems he has changed. He talks differently. It's hard to describe it but I feel like I'm talking to a different person. The words and phrases he uses doesn't fit him.

He also went drinking at clubs/bars very regularly, which is quite shocking to me as he usually doesn't drink or club.

He has also started spending more lavishly, constantly pestering me to invite my friends and go out for a meal at expensive restaurants followed by drinks. He offered to pay for all our expenses. 

I did some reading about change in character and it did not give me very reassuring outcomes as to why he is doing this.

Just not sure if I should do something or if I'm overthinking about this."
65181,"Being a private tutor without experience, I charged my students almost the cheapest in town. 
To my horror, I get this parent who consistently send me her child's homework EVERY DAY, thru facebook and whatsapp, in a very demanding, persistent and rude way to chase me finish her child's h/w everyday, and yelled at me when her child get bored over exercises in class. Eventually i realise its not worth my time and effort to continue so i just cancel off the tuition. 
Just seeking for advice, how do teachers deal with terrible parents who dont respect teacher at all?"
65178,"I’m 23M dating a girl 19F going to matriculate into NUS this year, we’ve been dating for 3 years and recently I got a maplestory GF and she is super unhappy about it. Is this cheating?

I already paid for the marriage package in maple, so how?"
65177,"I am still in love with my ex, and it seems like my ex is still in love with me too. Our interactions are technically purely platonic, and yet there seems to be renewed (and unsaid) hope of rekindling our love. However, the reason we broke up in the first place is because we couldn't see a way for the LDR to end, and I think that is still true today. So as much as I want to get back together, it seems impossible. Why must matters of the heart be so complicated?"
65171,"To all those who are interning:

Would you still use the leave? It feels like a waste to not use the leave but at the same time feel guilty for taking time off even though I don't really have anything on..."
65168,"Exasperated and after finally having enough I called off my relationship of 2 years. Reason being, my boyfriend is super immature and insensitive to me.

For example he has made fun of my friends for being fat, ugly. He finds delight in making fun of people and sees no harm. Someone carrying his boy school mentality into his adulthood. Recently, when I get angry about such issues and my anger pushes him to the edge, he goes to the extreme in making sure he spites me- I.e: blaming my friend for being fat, that’s why some guy ghosted her, blaming me for sharing tables / giving up our seats to the elderly, makinng me feel bad for being nice. 

To him I’m restrictive, suffocating constantly policing and getting pissed w the things he says. He says he walks on eggshells with me. However I explained that i only get upset when it’s disrespectful/ mean. He’s also a very critical person by nature(always has smth to comment about people)

65163,I'm in a 1.5y relationship with my boyfriend. Everything seems to be well till recently he gets annoyed with me easily when we meet. Sometimes we were having a happy date but suddenly he could get annoyed. He would then ignore me and this can last a few days. Is it I have done something wrong or why is this happening?
65162,"I am in my 30s already. Because of a series of bad decisions, I could not continue my education after my A level, although I did quite well enough to fall under the 90th percentile of the course I am interested now.

I was thinking of applying to NUS next year as a full-time mature candidate. However, my work experience is mostly admin work and stuff, and nothing related to the course I am keen on.

Is it possible to find entry level jobs at mid/late thirties after graduating? How would an employer view a relatively older fresh graduate compared to younger ones who are competing for the same job. In general, will they value our personal experience and soft skills, or will they discriminate us because we started late?

I am feeling quite low thinking about my future because my current education level can't get me anywhere but a low paying dead-end job :( And I am also not very entrepreneurial so that's not an option for me.

Anyone can offer advice please? Thanks in advance!"

There is a funny story I hear from some HR personnel. One HR personnel asked another opinion about this applicant, who was still working at the latter’s company. The latter paused for a moment answered: “Because we are friends, I’ll tell you while that girl is competent, she’s a troublesome agent of chaos. She would engineer internal conflicts among your staff while being appraently innocent. If we weren’t friends, I would have heaped praises on that girl so that we can get rid of her”.
In general, even when you quit, do so on exctremely good terms. On the other hand, you can also be extremely innocently annoying that people want to push you to another place."
65158,"Hello, I recently called off my wedding with my ex fiancé due to some arguments. Was told by some of my friends about a post circulating on NUSWhispers which bears high resemblance to my situation. I believe the OP of #64974 and #65116 is my ex fiancé. I just want to share my side of the story.

Yes, it’s true that my ex fiancé got a pay rise recently and that ended up with her pay being higher than mine. But what happened was after her pay rise, I saw a side of her that I never noticed before. She became arrogant, controlling, and bossy. She acted like a know it all. She treated me as if I was a beggar who needed her to feed me. When we’re out with our friends, she acted as if she was the boss and I was her subordinate. When you’re treated like her subordinate when in reality you’re not, how can you not lose face?

Now that I’ve seen her post on NUSWhispers, i can be even more certain that I made the right decision to call off the wedding. I saw one of her posts which called me childish. Well let me say she is the real childish one. Why is she so childish that she has to go onto such an anonymous forum to rant, instead of communicating directly with me? If my future wife is this type of person who will stab me the back and complain about everything we disagree on by ranting anonymously online, then of course I would call off the wedding!

If anyone wants to say that I’ve drooped to as low as her by posting this post anonymously online, let me say to them this: I myself am only commenting here because I want to give everyone here the other side of the story. And also to warn others against falling into the situation that I’m in now.  To those guys out there, these type of women are toxic. If you ever come across this type of women, LEAVE HER AT ALL COSTS."
65157,"My girlfriend recently got close to this colleague at work and in my opinion she spends too much time with him. They initially started going out for dinner together 1 on 1 ( I was fine with it as she informed me about it beforehand and didn’t hide it from me). 

Subsequently, the colleague started to send her back home on an almost daily basis though he really stays out of the way. It seems that they are getting closer together while my relationship with her is drifting apart; he even went over her house to jog with her 2 weeks ago wtf? I openly expressed my disapproval of her colleague many times and told my girlfriend that he has ulterior motives. She insisted there was nothing between them and they were just friends. She then accused me of lacking trust in our relationship and we ended fighting a few times because of this issue. 

A few days ago, while we were together at her house I was so insecure that I stalked her phone while she was bathing  (I know it is wrong, but I really had to find out what was happening between them), and found out that she was planning a trip with him to Bali together in December?! And in their chat there were several romantic exchanges, some bordering on sexual side. I didn’t know what to make of it at that point of time; were they just merely joking/toying with each other or what? I was so upset that I cried and left her house immediately, citing that I had urgent work to attend to. 

Till now I have not confronted her about this as I don’t want to start a big fight again. I 100% certain that colleague of hers is hitting on her and I don’t believe she is oblivious to this. I really love her a lot (we have been together for 7 years) and I don’t want to lose her at all, but the red flags are so obvious. 

I am having sleepless nights and crying alone a few times a day because of this, help me."

65148,"I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. But she has recently discovered a fetish that she enjoys so much that it has become her raison d’être - Power play. Let me start off by saying that I am quite an open-minded person but things have gotten far too intense till the point where it makes me feel...evil.

She would ask me hit her, berate her by calling her derogatory terms like “slut”, “bitch”, “c*ck sleeve”. There were even times when she asked me to choke her with my dog’s leash (actually my bull terrier’s leash). Yesterday, she asked me to pee on her (In my dorm room) and that was the last straw. 

She’s my baby and i absolutely hate treating her this way.  I want to tell her that I am not comfortable with this arrangement at all but im afraid i’ll come across as unreciprocative as she accommodates my fantasies too albeit less extreme. What do i do? Seeing how much powerplay turns on her inner sex demon im afraid it is something she is unwilling to give up."

65145,"I am the OP of #65145. I would like to say the following

1. I didn't get cheated on; neither did I wore the green beret. The content was hastily written, hence i didn't proofread what i have wrote.

Long story short, prior to us (my girl and I) being together, she was with another guy. They dated for 3-4 months, and from what I know, it was her first love. She trusted him and decided to do it with him. She let him enter the kingdom and wreck chaos resulting in her losing her virginity to a scum which left her shortly after..... When I heard from her very own mouth that she isn't a virgin, I was furious.

Anyway shd disclosed her status while I told her how some mammals are able to mate with just one partner for life.


I had this thought that I would be her first and probably her last....hais

 Yes, if you were to ask me, I was devastated when she said that she is not a virgin. I tried to be positive and told myself is okay......

Then I asked, ""Did the two of you used condom while doing it?"" She said no. This is where my frustration, anger, and anguish popped. Like what the hell you guys didn't even use a condom, and you even let the guy came inside you like a tsunami.  

We used to discuss about getting maried and having kids, but after hearing what she said, I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon. I can't see myself sliding my dick into her kingdom which has already been splashed. If my smaller head goes in, it will feel as though her ex is taking a piss at my smaller head..........

To all those who suggested hymen reconstruction does it come with cleaning services? Like will the doctor clean her wall? ......... No right....

As much as I hate the fact that she is not a virgin and she let someone came inside her, I still love her.......

Meeting her is probably the best thing ever; but i doubt making love and producing a kid will be the same..... 

To all the girls out there, if you want to lose your virginity and let someone splash inside you, make damn sure that the guy is the one who will be with you till the end of the world. Otherwise, at the very least, use a damn condom.


As of now, I am seriously lost.

The same applies when you doubt that the feeling with your crush is mutual. You should confess if you intend to have proper closure and move on.

There are games out there that deals with sexual themes, and I'd say GTA is actually very mild to just include ""strip club(s)"". So I suppose if you found out your boyfriend was playing games like Senran Kagura, Azur Lane, or even Catherine full body, you would ban him from playing them too? Then where will it stop? Machiam Great Firewall of China

""I can give up on what he don't like me to do, why cant he do the same too?"" - if you haven't realized it yet, this mindset has got to change. It is extremely unhealthy for your relationship and is extremely one-sided. While it is commendable that you are willing to change for his preferences, you should not be expecting him to change to suit your preferences in return. While it may seem trivial at first, it takes years for discontent and frustrations to bottle up and may eventually explode. Discuss with him and reach a compromise instead"

This teacher is also the 'cool' type of teacher that got along really well with most students, he's supposedly a really nice teacher but I guess deep down he's not.

I believe this has been going on for years (according to their convo and how they continued to keep in touch since sec school till now uni.) It seems like she's really in love with him and I'm worried that she might be too deep in this for her to understand what's right and wrong anymore. 

One of the comments also said that she's of legal age now so it's not legally wrong but it's just morally wrong and I'm worried about what might happen in the long term. This teacher is definitely wrong and sick in getting involved with a (ex) student and doing such things behind his wife and kids' back. It's just disgusting. 

Pls tell me what I should do. Or what should I tell her in order for her to realize that she needs to get out of this."
65103,"I always feel secretly happy when people around me fail. For instance, I felt glad when a friend unexpectedly got a much lower grade than me and another friend broke off with his girlfriend. Also when I read about some ex-millionaire made bankrupt or celebrity scandal. Am I normal?"
65102,Hello #65041. In the 21st century gender equality means equality in terms of privacy for men too. What a one sided thought you have when you recommend that the womens toilet should have more floor space allocated. As a guy who use the cubicle to pee I prefer my privacy and dignity. Well if you want speed then you might as well invent a urinal for women to pee in a similar open fashion. I dont think you will agree to that. Likewise I dont agree on more urinal than cubicles in the gents.
65100,To #65066: i can totally understand where your female friend is coming from as its one of my girlfriend dream to be naked when she is living alone cos she can feel free too. Dont judge them. I find it rather cute actually. There was once i even went up to her house for out 1st anniversary and caught her scurrying back to her room as she was only wearing a t shirt with only an underwear (since there was a maid at home so she didnt go totally naked).
