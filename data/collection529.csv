52999,"Dear RVRC,

The intent is to provide residents with a sense of pride and accomplishment for gaining more demerit points.

As for number of points, we selected initial values based upon data from the random number generator and other adjustments made to milestone points before giving them out freely. Among other things, we're looking at average per-resident demerit points rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that residents have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via offences.

We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on NUSWhispers, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.

Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.

52998,"A student once asked me at a dialogue, “How is RVRC going to ensure that this RC is a good RC?""

As part of my discussion with the student, I asked his friend, who is staying in RVRC, if he liked his RC, if his RFs were good and were helping him to live well, and if he enjoyed going to GEQ, ES, WR classes every morning. He readily said “YES” to all of these questions. I replied - “Then you are in a good RC!” "
52997,"I am a year 2 science student currently residing in RVRC, and in light of the supposedly negative confessions on the college, I just want to highlight a few things on the college.

1. Yes, to some extent the demerit system here is a bit harsh. Some offences indeed are not worthy of demerit points. Perhaps the issue is with the Resident Fellow (?) and not the college itself. Come on we are all adults at least respect our privacy. Just pray that you get to stay in the tower block like me if you are an incoming freshman looking to stay on campus.

2. Flag days, Walk for rice, International Coastal cleanups, other events etc which require you to wake up 7am, wear the purple RV shirts and have your Saturdays burned. Yes these events are kinda boring, compulsory, waste of time, etc. But before you even applied you should have did some research that these are just some of the college requirements to fulfill, and RVRC focuses on sustainability. Not as if they expect you to commit to a few CCAs like in the residential halls to earn your stay for year 2 in beyond. So just suck it up.

3. Central location. Need I say even more? 5 minute walk to the exam venues, 7 minute walk to Science (And Yes, there is sheltered pathway from RVRC all the way to science S16) and compared to the people staying in UTown we actually have it easy. No need to worry about squeezing on the campus buses.

4. Some of the hate towards RVRC on NUSWhispers is unjustified. Read the other related RVRC posts with a pinch of salt."

52993,"rules are dumb, demerit points are ridiculous but nobody forced any of you to stay in rvrc?? we acknowledged the rules and even did a stupid quiz on uhms when we accepted our offer. now that people are getting caught and actually receiving demerit points, rvrc is being “unreasonable” and “treating us like kids”. the rules are there and we all “agreed” to it when we chose to stay. just because of the fact that they haven’t been enforcing the rules so strictly in the past x years doesn’t mean that these rules are gone lol. grow up and stop whining like kids, 6 demerit points won’t ruin your future "
52992,"Hi NUS,
On another note, RV requires students to complete a module, and 2 forums (~12hours each), all of which amount to 0 MCs, students can get the RV certificate. For seniors in RVRC, the senior year programme was not developed yet when we entered the college, as it was just transitioning into a two-year programme. We were only told that there would be forums, which we expected not to be intensive, due to it being non-credit bearing. This year, we were newly informed that each forum comprises multiple sessions, adding up to around 12 hours. All non-credit bearing.

For prospective freshmen, do take this piece of information into consideration, if you are interested in applying for an RC academic programme. Consider VERY CAREFULLY"
52991,"Dear NUS,
Once again, this is another post about RVRC. As a student from RVRC, I cannot deny that there are benefits to staying at this residence. It is conveniently located near to several faculties, and right across the road from the examination halls.

Initially, RVRC struck me as a down-to-earth college that was peaceful and suitable for an introverted person like myself. I used to be proud of being part of the RC and was somewhat glad that I was re-directed to this college instead of the UTown college I had originally applied for.

Well, not anymore. 

I believe that those who disagree with the influx of complaints on NUSWhispers are those who have not heard stories directly from peers who have been unfairly treated, or who have not had close dealings with the RVRC management. Over the time I spent in the RC, I heard many stories from direct sources about the management's antics (both small and large scale) which has soured my opinion of them.

Examples of unfair treatment would be when some students had a particular RF barge into their rooms, for trivial reasons such as having more than a pair of shoes outside their doors. Or other students who experienced having their doors knocked and then immediately opened by that RF, who did not wait for the student to respond to the knocking. In itself, this act on the part of the RF reflects utter disregard for students and has led to students feeling enraged and violated.

To give an example of a more high-profile violation in the college, there was also a fiasco regarding the College Student Committee for the batch of 2016/2017. A new committee of students was hand-picked by the management without the CSC's knowledge, and the CSC was later abruptly dismissed without proper notice. There are also more stories regarding the unprofessional behaviour of RV's management.

To clarify matters, I myself have not gotten any demerit points from the college. I am not here because I am unable to accept the weight of my 'mistakes'. I believe that RVRC students are posting these complaints on NUSWhispers instead of sending in emails or posting on RV's facebook page because we want to make these issues known to NUS, and thus provide an external pressure to the college to change their management style. Because if we sent in a private email, would they really bother doing anything?
"
52990,"To all the salty RVRC students who are sending in ugly confessions about the place that u r currently residing in. What they are doing aren’t against the rules, while it might be slightly overbearing at times, it doesn’t mean u should post nasty confessions on this platform n flame the place. U should voice out your concerns to the person with the highest authority in RVRC instead of hiding behind a screen n act like a keyboard warrior. Take some pride in yourself n reflect on your own actions. People mentioned that talking to the management didn’t help, have u tried talking to the master? Please do yourself a favor and tackle this in a more graceful n civilized way instead of acting like kids here. (People r judging not only RVRC but the ones who r posting here too) "
52987,Why does rvrc need to be so strict on students? Isn't everyone in university already adults or young adults who can be responsible for their own actions? I think that the people in charge are just power hungry tyrants that need to exert dominance by giving demerit points to feel good about their insecure and pathetic selves
52986,"I really want to teach at the university level. Teaching is such a joy. However, I don't like doing research. Should I still go for PhD?"
52985,"RVRC is definitely not worth gng to... so many double standard.. got rules but must understand the purpose of the rules..  is not to use it as a whacking stick on your own student, everyone needs to live and work together why must u go around antagonizing your own people? Why make life so difficult? What KPI r u trying to achieve? Do u feel good chasing your own residents?

Now you make until this situation so large.. some rules must be removed in terms of logic - small deco on door get demerits, shoes outside door (your own door outside got 5 pairs leh). U want to be moral high ground or just power hungry? 

Wake up pls"
52983,"@52967 Are u daft? You're either management or you have had completely no clue what has happened both in the past week and in the history of rv. Used to stay in rvrc and I'm glad that finally people are stepping up to call out overly aggressive policing and micromanagement. Why escalate so much? Why is student life dictated by higher ups? 

Also I'm p sure anyone can see the proximity or modules but they should also know the culture and lifestyle before they commit 2 years to this."
52982,"To the writer of #52967, you are misrepresenting the rvrc students and the seriousness of the problem by alleging that these complaints on NUSWhispers were the work of a salty immature kid. I assume you are a rvrc resident too, and you will know the issue of overpolicing here is real, stiffling, and has caused many problems to many students and even seniors. It is a fact that there are rvrc staff who barge into student's room for spotchecks, it is also a fact that rvrc staff have tried to review the ohs rules and impose more stringent conditions, such as leaving the door further than just ajar - it must be one elbow length when opposite genders are inside. At the heart of the issue, it is evident that the focus of rvrc is on regimentation, even if it is at the expense of the quality of residential life of the students. These are not issues that can be resolved or glossed over because of rvrc's good location or because you can be a phantom here. You also know better why people choose to complain on NUSWhispers instead of talking directly to the management, because so many batches of seniors have tried and failed.

52978,"Why is everyone complaining about RVRC? I love RVRC and the way the staff treat me because I am a masochist. I love surprises and I get real turned on when the RF bursts into my room without knocking. I love being discretely watched all the time through the security cameras because it makes me feel like I am the center of attention. I love competing with my fellow residents for demerit points through means that I didn't know existed! The more points the better right? First to 16 points wins. I love it when I am heroically rescued from fires by the removal of an extra shoe outside my door as it makes me feel like a Disney princess. I love the 5 Michelin star food served everyday that tastes like a wet dream from a K-drama. I love displaying my boy-on-girl action when I leave my door wide open for everyone to see me being a naughty girl. I love the dictatorship and it makes me feel like I'm on tour in North Korea for free! I love reliving my primary school days through the extreme disciplinary regime, and I am even thinking of going for RVRC flag raising every morning at 7am with pride in our RVRC purple!!! I love having no fun culture in RVRC because I can focus on being a loser instead. I love the way the College Master is not the highest authority as it gives me hope as the underdog. I love the suspense from not knowing if I will be expelled today, tomorrow or next week. Every time I open my email I hope that they give me more points to set a new high score. All in all, I love RVRC and would recommend staying here to anyone who hates themselves so much that they enrolled into university to torture themselves and wants to die 50 years early "
52977,"I am from RVRC (Ridge View Residential College) and I would like to share my views on the recent musings on whispers. I am just an ordinary person, with one pair of shoes outside of my door, and I try not to inconvenience my friends living around me.

RVRC is a place where I met made new friends and meet passionate people from all walks of life. I do not know how it will be like if I were in another college, but I do not have much regrets staying in RVRC. It's pretty comfortable and cosy here, with slightly larger rooms in the blocks A to E and the convenience of being at the centre of the school. 

So far I have never encountered any RF barging into my room, and i think it is because they have no reason to do so. I don't think it is fair of previous commentors to make such incidents sound like it is super common? Maybe these news are being oversensationalised just for the laughs amongst other things."

To those who are wondering why we cannot go through ""official"" up the chain means of complaints, simply put - many of my seniors have tried. During dialogue sessions, with the more friendly teachers, etc. However they had no say - student committees were axed and replaced with favorites. They completely removed a fully functional and up-and-coming student leader committee as the power hungry management leader wanted things her way.

52958,"to #52958: I am the author of #52900 
Yeah mine was a similar predicament, so I applied to those in more affordable countries (not approved by SMC), but was rejected a couple of times. 

Put yourself out there to experience new things, talk to people about what you want to do, then you would realise what is practicable and whether you had over-idealised your dream. That's why doing shadowing and volunteering may help. If you can envision yourself working in that setting in the future, you would be more motivated to continue pursuing the dream.

For me, at this point, closing in on graduation, I start to see the possible job prospects should I graduate from my current course. I start to waver a little considering how I may still find something suitable for me in this industry if I ultimately don't do medicine. I have come to terms with the fact that while Medicine is my first choice, there are many other ways I can contribute to a good cause with my skillsets. My 'backup plan' is to work with NGOs after getting some years of work experience, so I am currently quite at peace with myself should I not obtain admittance to med school. Anyway, no med school means I get a life. If you think that life is hard now, it may be worse in med school, so there is nothing to 'complain' about at this stage.

While the future seems bleak, while 4 years may seem like a long wait, be at peace with yourself and live your life to the fullest. I understand your worry and anxiety as I was where you were. If you were meant to be a medical doctor, it would happen somehow, and since a part of it would be dependent on what you do now, don't leave regrets:)"

52953," I'm another student from RVRC. I don't like writing rants like this online but I feel like I have to as the college have really alienated its students with it's recent antics (which explains the recent surge of RVRC students complaining here)

Here are some examples of some of the ridiculous things which RVRC's management have reprimanded and/or charged students demerit points for:
1) Leaving decorations on our room doors (which is perfectly acceptable in  other RCs/Halls)
2) Leaving more than 1 pair of shoes outside our rooms. They justify this rule by saying that every additional pair constitutes as a fire hazard, but then again there's a Residential Fellow with 5 pairs of shoes outside her door so... What's worse is that I know somebody who was woken up at 6am just to be told to keep his shoes in his room
3) Having mutually agreeable room swaps. Both parties were agreeable to swap rooms and had the backing of the Office of Housing Services. But RV management blocked it and gave demerit points to both of them for swapping rooms beforehand
4) For leaving a towel in the toilet. Someone had their towel thrown away and was threatened with demerit points just for that (is this really necessary? Surely a simple ""please remove your towel"" will do?)
5) For not locking our doors 
6) For leaving our stuff in lounges while we're not there
7) For an untidy room (Tidiness honestly is so subjective, what could be untidy to one could be tidy to another)

While I do agree that rules are rules and they are meant to be followed, I feel that there is some leeway that can be exercised here. I don't agree that any of the above instances even warrant a reprimand or demerit points. If there isn't any major inconvenience or repercussions to our fellow residents from those instances then I don't think it warrants disciplinary action. I believe as young adults we know if our actions are really too much. 

RV is a very young RC and honestly, a lot of us have really tried to improve the culture here and to make ourselves distinct from the UTown RCs. However, this over the top disciplinarian approach and constant interference by the management is killing the freedom of its residents and  any attempt at forming a distinct college culture. 

Also, if you are planning on going on exchange in Y2S2 (especially for biz students), join other RCs. Unlike the UTown RCs, RV doesn't reserve a place upon your return in Y3S1, despite contractually being given a 2 year stay as part of the college program. The people in RVRC who are affected by this have said they feel alienated by the college, especially as all of them has contributed to the college as part of its FOC committee

TL:DR: For incoming freshmen, if you desire to enjoy a hall/residential college culture, don't join RV. You will just feel restricted with no freedom to enjoy yourselves.

It is time to end their reign of terror and control! If my door is closed, it is common courtesy to knock and wait for me to answer. Just because you are an RF and have grounds of ""suspicion"" doesn't mean you can open my door at any time and invade my privacy.  No one can climb out of the window so there is no need to storm in.

Turns out they were wrong. There is a culture. The NS style, anal, watchful, no freedom, treated like kids kind of culture. I mean seriously. 

No more than 1 shoe outside corridor?? I mean I get there has to be a limit to prevent the common corridor from being blocked but 1 is wayyy too little!! 

No member of opposite sex in the room without leaving thedoor open?? Help la all are young adults here. This isn't the 1960s where having a girl/guy in your room automatically means having sex. Platonic friendships do exists. And besides so what if they decide to have sex? Again, uni students, legal consenting adults. NUS offers married rooms for married suites for MBA students so I don't see this as an issue of NUS not allowing sex in school. As long as it's behind closed doors, doesn't disturb neighbours and MOST IMPORTANTLY IS LEGAL (aka consensual and parties are not minors) then there should not be an issue.

And also what's with staff members barging in to our rooms?? Hello have some respect for our privacy please. You wouldn't want people barging in to YOUR rooms would you? It's not a matter of having nothing to hide, it's a matter of respecting others privacy.
Guess I should have saw it coming when the FOC was already so micro managed by the staff members instead of being what uni level camps should be. A camp FOR students BY students.

Unless I see a change in the rest of the year, I really see no reason to tell my juniors to join RVRC."
52942,Is Uni all about the grades? I can feel that my friends judge my intelligence based on my tutorials and assignments. I might be a lot dumber than them but I at least try to my best in studies. 
52940,"Admin please don't remove this post. I have already done my due diligence in censoring and watering down the tone of this post so that it could be published. So here goes: 

Another student from RVRC here. In all honesty, if you intend to stay on campus, do yourself a favour by applying for other halls or RCs instead. Aside from what was already mentioned in the previous posts about demerit points, I would like to also point out that RV has a notorious RF who would barge into students' rooms without seeking permission. 

Yes we understand that RFs do have the authority to enter rooms without permissions, but only under strong justifications. This particular RF would enter the residents' rooms for the most trivial matters (such as for leaving more than a pair of shoes outside), and this RF may even do so in the room owner's absence, which I personally found to be an utter disrespect of personal privacy. 

I did not spend nearly $3000 per sem for a single room only to have my privacy invaded so easily. RV may argue that they are doing so to uphold house discipline, but I feel that this still doesn't warrant the RFs the right to abuse their authority so easily. While it is true that I have signed and agreed to certain terms and conditions before moving into RV, I would still be uncomfortable knowing that there's a RF lurking around, ready to jump on unsuspecting residents in the comforts of their own rooms. It would be nice if RV could actually respect the residents' privacy, and at least knock and inform them about spot checks instead of just entering a room uninvited. 

For a young and budding RC, RV still has a long way to go before they could finally establish a sound reputation that can easily draw in students the way UTRCs do. Seeing how RV has been so readily dispensing demerit points to its residents, and how the RFs are increasingly intrusive and uptight, RV may one day find itself in a chokehold caused by no one other than themselves.

P.S For my fellow residents here in RV, it would be strongly advised for us to keep our rooms locked and bolted at all times, otherwise the RFs would just take it as a sign of invitation.

I was in a similar position. It was not Medicine, but Teaching. My parents were teachers so for most of my life I aspired to be a teacher. But when I failed to get higher tier scholarships unlike most of my friends, I was devastated. It did not matter how absolutely well I was doing in life, I measured myself relatively and was resentful at life and at my peers who could get what I thought was a better deal. 

Our problem is actually our own idea of ourselves. We are fixated on an idea we constructed of what we must be.  If we gave ourselves a chance to grow instead of wallowing in resentment, we could actualize in ways that we can't even envision now. It need not be Medicine for you. Even if it was or wasn't, your sense of worth and validation need not be linked to this.

I just graduated this year. I struggled with this sense of resentment but gradually understood more about life in general. You seem way younger in uni, so do utilise your chances there to discover and do something worthy!"
52922,"Honestly, uni did not prepare me well for the job market. Unlike other engin grads whom have done deeper and more in depth programming like python, html, css, our course did not provide us with the necessary skills needed for jobs. 
Quality service engineers, sorry you no quality assurance background. Biomedical engineer in hospital, sorry you no exp in hospital setting. Need at least 2 years.
The most we got is sales engineer, basically to sell things to people. Most of us are not even doing things that are related to our course.

52921,I'm stuck with a group of nerds who talks about projects/ assignments/ grades always. Never have there been a time we talked about other topics other than gossiping about others. Is it wise to leave this group of nerds or stick with them for the connections
52918,To #52901: You are definitely not the only one who is facing this situation. Trust your gut feelings in deciding whether to make a change. What others think of your choice is of zero importance compared to your happiness. Do what is best for you since it has only been one semester (in case you are worried about the costs or time). Four years is a long time if you intend to just 'suck it up'.
52917,Currently i just have no passion and interest in anything not even guys... At least last time can still be motivated to study to impress guys... Now got no motivation to do anything leh help please. :(
52915,"#52888 before entering medicine, everybody talks about how much they want to serve the society. After commencement they complain about having so many on calls, long hours. Seriously is 5-6 per month a lot??? Especially bad is nowadays millenials not as hardworking as gen y. Still dare to talk back to senior. Unwillingly to slog quietly, wants reward

you will be one of them. Statistics speak for itself."
52912,"I feel I am a strawberry. I am always anxious about little things. Like even going to school, I will be worried about the trip and even the classroom. I always desired if no one noticed me at all. 

I have thought of killing myself over some meaningless things. Like how other might 'perceive me'. I am that odd ball in every cohort but I wish no one had ever noticed me.

I do better if I know no one in the class. I worried about how ppl I know judge me."
52907,I feel hopeless. I don't think I will find a girlfriend anytime soon but I like kids. Is it ok to adopt at the age of 25?..
52904,"I have always been bothered by this but how does one make a social life in uni when there's little opportunity to even stay on campus? 
If you wanna stay in RCs, you gotta be smart and have a good portfolio to boast for in your application form. If you wanna stay in hall, you gotta have a good CCA record of sports in your application form. And if you can't fulfil either, you get chucked into PGP where there's no social life either way.

 The thing about NUS' campus living is that it's kinda discriminatory unlike NTU where everyone is guaranteed 2 years stay. Sucks but true...isn't it? "
52903,"In response to #52890:
I'm sorry the uni has tried to subject you to a higher standard of training and education :/ I mean what were they thinking right? It's not like they would and should like to train more capable students anyway smh"
52902,"#52902. You must be joking. After the elections, the nussu reps have absolutely zero obligation to meet their faculty or otherwise be accountable. If they had, do you think anyone would run for nussu, knowing that they would have to justify every council decision to their fellow students?"

Yeah mine was a similar predicament, so I applied to those in more affordable countries (not approved by SMC), but was rejected a couple of times. 

Put yourself out there to experience new things, talk to people about what you want to do, then you would realise what is practicable and whether you had over-idealised your dream. That's why doing shadowing and volunteering may help. If you can envision yourself working in that setting in the future, you would be more motivated to continue pursuing the dream.

For me, at this point, closing in on graduation, I start to see the possible job prospects should I graduate from my current course. I start to waver a little considering how I may still find something suitable for me in this industry if I ultimately don't do medicine. I have come to terms with the fact that while Medicine is my first choice, there are many other ways I can contribute to a good cause with my skillsets. My 'backup plan' is to work with NGOs after getting some years of work experience, so I am currently quite at peace with myself should I not obtain admittance to med school. Anyway, no med school means I get a life. If you think that life is hard now, it may be worse in med school, so there is nothing to 'complain' about at this stage.

While the future seems bleak, while 4 years may seem like a long wait, be at peace with yourself and live your life to the fullest. I understand your worry and anxiety as I was where you were. If you were meant to be a medical doctor, it would happen somehow, and since a part of it would be dependent on what you do now, don't leave regrets:)"
