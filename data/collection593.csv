59399,Can office of campus amenities update their website? Some of the retail stores and food outlets dont exist anymore
59398,"Sigh... I have been evergreen my whole life and I am already 25. The reason I am evergreen is somewhat by choice and not really my choice. 
I have quite serious crushes on a few guys. But I have been rejected subtly, brutually ignored and even bro-zoned... I realized that the guys I like usually have the same trait... slightly extroverted, hardworking mugger, strange but unique sense of humour... i would say that this is a type but it isn’t clear cut like the nice guy or playboy type. But somehow I don’t think I’m their type seeing how they have zero interest in me... 
on the other hand, there are some guys kind of into me but I suppose they don’t fall into the type that I like. As much as I try to I can’t feel anything... knowing that this will end up bad if I were to continue so I just opt not take a step forward. 
But now I’m kind of feeling old and people around me all dating, bto-ing, wedding photo shoot etc I feel happy for them but I just feel kind of worried, what if I can never find a person whom I like and likes me back..."
59397,"If a guy is interested to know what you wanna do in the future, shares something personal and tells you not to share anyone else, ask for your opinion on things he care a lot about and shares what he thinks about himself, is he interested in you? I want to know because I really like him. "
59393,"I'm secretly still friends on facebook with my ex. I honestly didn't realise it because he was rather inactive after we broke up during his stint in NS, but now that he's gotten attached I can't stand looking at them tag each other in things and especially when she posts on his wall saying cute stuff like ""this was us"" or like cute animal memes. Doesn't help that their profile pics are pretty much the same. Hais… Is it time to block him?"
59390,I'm bored and want to talk to strangers on Tinder but also don't want people to recognise me. What to do :-(
59388,Does a person not accepting facebook request from you mean that the person doesnt want to be friends with you?The person never accept or decline the request though.
59387,"There is a person in my class whom I feel that he is rather warm and friendly but we are not close to each other(just hi bye friends). Since I and him are both graduating soon, should I try to ask him if he would like to be friends or is it not advisable since we are not very close and furthermore, we will not have a chance to see each other again after graduation anyway?"
59384,"I am the OP of #59384, want to say that the post wasnt related to #59413 because it happened only yesterday around evening at PC commons and she was actually studying till late night. 

Btw,the door didnt really hit her face but she was sandwiched in between the door like how the MRT gantry kiap your body when you try to tailgate without paying. Anyway, what will you do at that point of time if you were me? "
59383,"Hello, I am an Australian born Chinese girl looking to move to Singapore and get used to the lifestyle here (perhaps even call it home). I’m looking to move here with my boyfriend who is actually a Singaporean who did schooling and army here and came to UNSW for medicine, I clicked with him because we shared many shared values (I’m basically a typical Asian piano and study nerd so you might think I’m the model child for the Asian parent) and we shared a passion for food. I introduced him to my parents and they approved, he introduced me to his international Singapore friends and accepted me as one of their own, everything is all sorted and I just graduated. He asked if he wants to come with him to stay in Singapore I decided why not, my parents approved too since he became close to them (he can speak Chinese in a fluent basis whilst for me I’m only semi-fluent while I struggle with grammars on and off, I’m better at Canto), he was such a nice boy who always nurtured and cared for me. But at the same time I heard the lifestyle is very different in Singapore? I made some international Singaporean friends, I’m pretty versed in Chinese culture whereas I celebrate the festives and take yearly trips to Guangzhou to visit my family, my parents instilled in me the sense to get a stable job to feed myself and future kids, but that’s limited as I grew up in Sydney all my life so I fear the struggles of trying to fit in despite meeting lovely people and all. What are tips you guys can give to make my ride easier?"
59381,How do u differentiate love and infatuation? Do couples start off having infatuation?
59380,"Hi all,

I was just wondering if anybody knew if it's possible to stop a sem mid way through? I'm having a really rough time with my personal life and I'd like to take some time away from it all. I don't even mind redoing the semester (or switching majors if that matters). Y1S2 student here, thanks in advance for your replies! "
59378,"I've been dating this girl for a few months and we officially got together last week. She's really nice, has the same kind of mindset as me and we click really well. 

But last night she asked me to have sex with her and I couldn't bring myself to do it. I realized that I like her like a sister rather than a girlfriend. I want to care for her and grow up with her but I can't bring myself to have sex. The thought feels disgusting like I am gonna do it with my actual sister.

What should I do? Should I break it off or try to force myself to do it?

59375,After getting our second child my wife just stopped and become disinterested in sex. Anyway to fix that? Is that normal for most ladies here?

59370,"#59298 Most of the comments on this post are so toxic and not supportive at all. ""They didn't like her cause she lacked EQ"" ""Why are you bothered by their comments"" ""Good grades doesn't mean you're smart"". 
These comments reflect a wider social problem. Society says that girls are supposed to be dumb, helpless creatures who require an intelligent, strong man to control them & save them from distress. People are dumbfounded and even intimidated when they meet an intelligent girl. This is so bad that I know really smart girls who pretend to be dumb so people feel more comfortable around them which reinforces the stereotype that girls are stupid. As a smart girl myself, I have met so many idiotic guys who think that they are superior in every way and brush off my ideas. However, I do not want to generalise because I also know some guys who really appreciate intellectual women (these guys are usually pretty intelligent themselves, keep them close). TL;DR GIRLS CAN BE SMART TOO"
59369,"I've got a similar problem to #59322 only I'm the ex in this relationship... So after we broke up due to her cheating on me with her course mate, I inadvertently found out from her friends they got together and were getting a lot of action too. Maybe I'm just salty or hurt, but I can't get the mental image of her banging him out of my head. I've tried dating a couple of girls afterwards but it never panned out because of this mental image. I think honestly the discussion about sexual partners is misguided if what people are worried about is performance anxiety. You'd be more likely to be compared to the one she's taken hundreds of times than hundreds of one-off rides on different shafts. And wouldn't it be worse to find out that she had a lot of sex with her ex but doesn't want to do it with you much?"
59368,"Imagine you have a younger sister that is skinny and yourself is a heavy weight girl. When you go out with shopping with her, she basically can fit into any dress, top and etc. But when you want to try out dress and stuff, you only can opt for the biggest size available. And not all types of cutting can fit you. And she keeps sarcastically showing off to you that she can wear everything and you will start to hate her day by day. And our parents always love to compare how both of us look. Like she’s always very skinny and pretty but looking at me they will always like to say you’re fat and can nvr fit into nice stuff and they will always tell you next time you can’t find a bf. But the main thing is guys don’t like fat gf. Even me myself know it. But I really hope I can go for a full plastic surgery. If not my confidence level will always be low. I ever told myself I’ll become pretty day by day. But it’s getting bitter and bitter day by day. And sometimes me myself find it helpless. Can someone help me?"

59366,"I have this friend who’s parents are super rich while I have to work for my money, but he would often call me calculative for wanting to split the cost of meals and stuff. Is treating eachother necessary in a friendship?"
59365,"Hi, I'm the OP of #59256. (Admin please don't filter this... thank you)

Rafe: Yes, we all keep on emphasising that results aren't important. But it's useless. The stress is something that she puts on herself. Not sure if she want to attend crash courses because of the costs haha... Yes, will bring her out for food and etc sometimes but most of the times, she'll give the excuse of ""I have homework to do. I'm very stressed. I don't want to go out.""

Andy: Yea...that is the case for a lot of people right now...

Cyrus: I'm trying!

Bobby: Due to some personal issues which I would not want to make public.

Lee: But JC isn't something that she wanted to enter in the beginning. If she's doing something that she prefers, wouldn't it make the process of learning more fun although it may get stressful at times? The main idea is parents enforcing their decisions on kids instead of considering what the kids really want.

Lim: Yes we told her to try her best but it's easier said than done. 

To the OP of #59278: I believe that you don't have to take the same course as what you've taken in Poly. I have a friend who took Comms in Poly but took HR in Uni instead. And yes, some of the comments are actually true, such as Goh's and Shiin's. 

To Ryan who commented under #59278: What's your point of making a comment like this? We made the choice? We chose to listen to our parents? Quit blaming others? Only know how to blame others for their situation? It's easier said than done. When you actually step into other's shoes, you will understand that it's easier than just putting the blame on 'victims'.  There may be underlying emotional and mental concerns that needs to be faced instead of just blaming people for their own actions. 

It's sad that some people who comment on posts on NUSWhispers only know how to put the blame on the people who are actually facing real issues. Things are not as simple as what you guys say. Things might be easy for you but may lead to complications for others..."
59361,"The Human Anxiety about Love and Lust with Castration as a Possible Solution (and a serving of a rant about my love life lol)

Amidst all these sex and relationship posts we see at least once everyday, I also can’t help feeling anxiety probably like the most of us, in one way or another. As such, at times, I really envy asexual or some religious people who don’t have the need to be desired and not having to satiate carnal needs. Other times I’d be jealous at chads and stacys who can have it their way.

All these hormones and the need to do our primal duty as living things has made me wonder what this angst is all about. I mean there are already so much of us humans around on earth and I do have the slightest thought of sexually castrating myself to rid of this anxiety and could probably help control the population as well, which I feel probably other people should have the slightest consideration to think about and we could do ourselves a favour from overpopulating this planet of limited resources.

It’s just a thought that lingers around time and again. I wonder if I would be much more of a productive human being and be happier if I had no libido whatsoever. However, at the same time, due to the need and urge to be loved, I’m scared and I don’t want to do it also. I wonder if there’s also a temporary solution that might help my anxiety due to this “need” and experiment how life would be without this desire.

(You can skip the next part to the end if you don’t want to read my rant about my sad love life…)

My love life isn’t flourishing as what I dream it to be and wonder if I do get there, will my feelings change? Personally, I’m still kinda learning the ropes in dating and haven’t been in a serious relationship. Most of my few sexual experiences have been paid partnerships and I never had the luxury of having FWBs. I’m not particularly bad looking, but I have my limitations that do inhibit my sexual value, like my height, my racial/religious identity and mostly due to my cynical and passive personality. I do blame myself in not taking risks when I had my chances with girls, because I had been too nice and respectful. I can easily mingle with girls casually and things can go well really quickly. However, every time I will hit the wall with the intent of going to bed with each girl, as I had always been caught in a moral dilemma that I should be a gentleman, but if you want to play the game you must be the bad boy which I had always feared that might incriminate me or put me in a bad light among my friends. I probably just don’t know girls that much yet and I still need more practice to know when to do the “wrong” things at the right time, but I’m already getting tired of failing and fed up of being so close to home runs and harping over past failures. I had gotten advice telling me that I should just go for the moves anyway and try not to get caught and respect the girl if it goes too far. Just play it cool and move on if it fails. If I get rejected early on I can easily move on and on without it being a big deal.

I haven’t really given up yet, though I do get scared at the thought of falling into the category of an incel due to me cock-blocking myself by DLV-ing and giving girls the chance to say no (it’s their innate defensive mechanism). (If you’re trying to date, you should know these terms…) I hope the girl I’m chasing after now might cure or treat my anxiety, but I don’t know for sure. It might be a passing feeling, but I do know that due to carnal tendencies, I’ll always be insatiable to do the deed, whether alone or with someone. That’s why I’m still having this small thought of hormonal or sexual castration in my mind and be more productive in school, or life in general. I hate to admit that my pursuits and trying to perfect the game have affected my grades and social life. Maybe I don’t know what love is yet, so sex can be out of the picture? I should probably let nature take its course…

(End of love life rant)

Now I want to bring up and consider another point, and is kinda going off tangent, which might sound very radical and will offend some or most people, and it has been done in some countries. Pardon me if it is so, but I just want to know the general consensus.

Is it time for us to slow things down a bit as a species? We could probably stop all this complaining about lack of love and/or sex life and shit if we all just sexually lobotomise ourselves (maybe at least temporarily to try out) and strive to be more productive, with only the need to reproduce as a controlled maintenance of our species…

Is the traditional goal of life overrated and is it time for change? I’m just opening this up to an open discussion here. Haven’t thought about talking about this to anyone and decided and I want to share here discreetly for a start. It’s all a random blurb of my thoughts that I wanna let out and I welcome anything. (Not a philosophy student, but I prefer deeper concepts to address this situation in layman terms, if possible)"
59360,"I've been wanting to say something for a while now and here it goes. The way I see it, NUSWhispers is an app that's been created to help people get something off their chest, share something or ask for advice. The whole point of it being anonymous is to make things easier by avoiding the possibility of other people judging the person or ridiculing him/her. But funnily, that still happens sometimes. I see posts of people complaining about their lives and asking what to do and sometimes, there's one comment that goes ""go tell the person concerned and not to thousands of random people"" or ""the hell am I reading"". For all we know, they might not even have people they can talk about such things to. I would like to point out that if you feel uncomfortable reading a post or feel that it's not something ""worth sharing"" based on your standards, kindly ignore it and move on in life instead of preventing people from coming forward to talk about their lives. :)  "

Isn't it obvious that A-levels do not determine everything?

A-levels only determine your university placements.

Your university only marginally determines your job placements, the most important component being connections.

After that, everything is determined by connections.

The lesson of the day is, be well-connected. One way to do that is to go to a school whose students are children of parents who run our world. Ideally, go to Harvard. "
59330,"Hey OP of #59330! I was also in a similar position to you. I got the top of the level for a while, until some new students from another country came and displaced me lol. I guess I was disheartened though I deserved it since I was starting to have some issues with myself as well. But the teachers had to rub it in. I remember one of them actually saying we Singaporeans were lazy and because of that we were letting the foreigners get ahead and still the top spot. She even LOOKED at me when she said that, and my friends agreed that it was directed at me. It really sucked.

59309,"Sometime back I found out that my then bf (now ex) was cheating on me with a mutual friend. I later realised that on those nights when he claimed he was tired and after he said good night to me, he was actually out with the other girl. This went on for several months until my gut feeling told me something was amiss and I confronted him. He then admitted everything to me. 

Basically he blamed everything on the other girl and victimised himself saying that he was coerced into the illicit relationship because the other girl was very manipulative. When I asked for a breakup, he threatened to commit suicide because he said he cannot live without me. 

I insisted on ending the relationship but even months after the breakup, he still continued to loiter near my neighbourhood.

This level of emotional blackmailing and manipulation is the worst. I cannot comprehend how can people like him be so selfish as to cheat, while claiming that he still loves me very much. I am so thankful that I am no longer in this toxic relationship.

Cheating on your partner is a really selfish act and you cannot imagine the extent of hurt and damage you will cause. The endless cycle of asking myself why it happened, and even blaming myself for it when it is clearly his fault. Up till this day, sometimes I feel insecure and find it hard trust people.

There are always plenty of temptations around us but it is about making the conscious effort to keep choosing your gf/bf over others. It may be easy to fall in love, but maintaining a relationship is never easy; it requires commitment and lots of effort. "
59307,"To #59307, I’m not sure what gave you that impression of academia, but you’re sorely mistaken. Academia is no longer the ivory tower that it was before, during which academics had much laxer tenure requirements, much higher pay, a conscionable workload, and often, also stay-at-home partners to tend to their daily needs. To put things in perspective, what was required for tenure in the humanities several decades ago (a few decent publications, and sometimes not even a doctorate degree) is pretty much the minimal output demanded of a fourth or fifth year grad student today. For this reason, grad students and academics alike now suffer burnout, depression, and anxiety rates much higher than what ought to be normal. 

I don’t know which faculty you’re in, or which field you intend to pursue, so I’ll first say here that I cannot tell you, with full certainty, what to expect. I can only speak to experiences of academia in the humanities. But what I want to say is that it really is not easy. Sure, a PhD may take only five to six years out of your life, post-docs two to three, and then you’ll spend yet another six year vying for tenure, but in every step of the way is so much precarity. You’ll be writing applications over and over, and then pitches, grants and proposals (most of which, mind you, will get turned down), so progression through the ranks will take much longer than you expect. And of course, you’re doing well in school now, and you may expect to keep doing just as well. But remember that you’ll be competing with the best students and budding academics from top universities across the world. The truth is that there are far more qualified applicants than there are tenured positions at universities, so unless you’re deeply passionate about what you do, and willing and able to take the risk of devoting years of your life to something that may not eventually pay off (the phenomenon of “alt-ac” is becoming increasingly prevalent for this reason), you’ll very likely be better off in a cushy consulting job. 

I hope this doesn’t come off as condescending, but if you’re really serious about becoming an academic, maybe try to speak frankly to other academics and read up on the state of the profession first. There’s a reason why grad students and early career fellows (and even mid to late career academics) are leaving academia in droves. 

tl;dr: academia is tough af. If you want a nice house and a fancy car, get a job in the CBD instead. "

59300,"To those lamenting about how good they will perform in an overseas university, I think you guys are far too arrogant. First of all, some of you actually had the chance to attend overseas university, you merely did not grasp the opportunity and decided to stick to local university for whatsoever reason. Yes, some of you are unfortunate that your parents cannot afford overseas university, than in which you cannot blame again as you are paying a cheaper price for your degree. YES, this world is P2W, the more rich you are, the further you can get in life. Secondly, you guys are not very smart either, if you guys were smart, getting first class should be an easy game even in NUS. Just because you got straights As overseas, that doesn't make you smarter. You are still mediocre as ever as you struggle to get A over here. Next, you guys should not complain about these ""poorer"" results jeopardizing your chances of getting a job or losing out to the peers that went overseas. What makes you think that it was precisely your result that cause your failure? In my opinion, it is your attitude that you guys have that result in it. There are millions of example where people with shit grades that went on becoming richer than the Lee family. The fact that you guys are relying on your paper qualifications to distinguish yourself from others is laughable. You are not products of a university, you are yourself and pretty sure the paper you hold amounts to literally nothing in contributing to the success you achieve in life. 

And before any of you tries to call me a hypocrite, I am not attending university for the paper qualifications. I am here to pickup a skill since my parents are able to afford it and enjoy whatever that comes along with it. I am fully prepared to dropout anytime and work full time at Starbucks if I have to. And no, my CAP isn't shit either."
