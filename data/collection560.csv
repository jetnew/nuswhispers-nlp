56098,"I don't get what's this thing about expecting relationships to not be about sex. Or this idea that seems to be permeating, that not having sex before marriage is better - that it results in better/more fulfilling relationships.

I mean it's true that your relationship would be reduced to being cheap and shallow if all it were about was sex. It's reasonable to say that your relationship should be about some kind of healthy balance between social, mental desire, as well as sexual desire. I mean, if you were sexually repulsed (or unattracted) to your partner in the first place, that's a recipe for failure right there (unless both you and your partner are fundamentally asexual, and you are both sexually unattracted to ANYONE).

All relationships that last long enough to become marriages either fall into the category of both individuals being asexual, or both individuals being at least slightly sexually attracted to each other. It would be ridiculous to anyone to want to date and/or marry someone they're not sexually attracted to. It would also be ridiculous to anyone, if it were made clearly obvious, to want to date and/or marry someone they were sexually attracted to, but who was not sexually attracted to them.

In the end, most people who marry or get into a relationship want sex(with sole exception of couples who BOTH don't want sex). They may be okay with waiting, they may want to abstain, but it would be unreasonable to think that sex is an optional part of the relationship. More importantly, it would be ridiculous to think that they might possibly be okay with never having sex."

56090,"Having controlling parents is not good for either the parents or the children. The children will keep wanting to break free and be a bit rebellious, while the parents will keep nitpicking and suspecting the children about the things they are doing. 

So whose fault is it? The children? I don't think so. Should the children be listening to the parents all the time and not have their own mindsets and beliefs? We can consult and ask for our parents opinions, but we can make our own decisions. So now whose fault is it? Parents should be supportive and encouraging, not some facade mask wearing monster acting all nice in front of ppl but in fact, are controlling ppl that get angry even when children don't update them on their lives for a few days overseas.

That's just our nature; we are horny all the time. If you spend a bit of time on YT, you might find borderly sexual contents that apparently people jack off to instead of actual porn. It's probably so that they don't feel guilty. Now, back to the question; my short answer is this: religion is something everybody talks about, but rarely practiced to the letter. Sex is something nobody talks about openly, but almost everybody do it (in one form or another).

My wife and I had a 3 years dating period before our marriage, and while we did not have vaginal penetrative sex, almost everything else is fair game. It was something we agreed upon: we like to feel good, and explore our bodies; just that sex is not what my then girlfriend wants. I respect that, but both of us like to feel good. Neither of us have any religious reasons for not doing it; it's just negotiations.

However, just like everyone else, they found loopholes around it and rationalize other acts to themselves: like taking a bath together, naked cuddling, mutual masturbation, etc ...

56076,"Girl from #55930 here. Sorry #56003, I am not your honeybee as I didn’t go staycay with my boyfriend over the weekend. Something more complicated happened.

The colleague messaged me after seeing my post to apologise for making me feel cheap. I waved it off and said it was in the past. We met up on Saturday for a meal for some innocent catchup.

During the meal, he mentioned he is now divorced after catching his ex-wife with another guy on their marital bed. Oh the irony, because we had copulated many times on that very same bed when his ex-wife was working.

After the meal, he invited me to his house for drinks. I accepted. Long story short, after many glasses of fine wine, we reconnected physically. Memories of our illicit past flowed back. Then, he was the cheater. Now, I am the cheater.

I felt guilt-wrecked after leaving his house as I made a no-sex before marriage pledge with my boyfriend. Not only have I broken that pledge, it was with the same colleague. 

That colleague has now proposed being fwbs again (he knows I am attached). 

I am conflicted. On one hand, I love my boyfriend a lot and don’t mind marrying him even though the colleague is richer, has a better body,  better looking and sexually in-sync with me. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to seem wanton by going against my no-sex pledge with my boyfriend so early (he is quite conservative) even though I have my needs. 

Should I just fwb with the colleague while technically upholding the pledge by abstaining from sex with my boyfriend? Why does life have to be so complicated?"

She is not immoral and she should not be shamed because it's her body so she can do whatever she wants. "
56072,"Actually this whole fwb argument, is very easy to resolve. So if one day your daughter tell you she has been having sex with numerous fwbs, will you be able to stay cool and say ""ya go ahead. Make more fwbs and have fun!""?"
56070,"Chiming in on the whole thing about fwb/sex before marriage. 

Personally i'm someone who's had sex with a handful of girls (all my exes). The sex was great and all, but I have to agree with #55982 that a lot of the gratification is short-lived. Even right after the sex, there's the usual post-coital tristesse. The 'reward' is mostly confined to before and during intercourse. 

Having tasted the joys (if you will) of sex and also now the fulfillment of being in an abstinent long-term relationship, I actually regret not staying a virgin till after marriage. I've never encountered anyone who deems lack of sexual experience as a dealbreaker. At worst, it's seen as an inconvenience to the more experienced partner. On the other hand, I can totally see why a person who's a virgin will feel bothered by someone who's had sexual history. My current girlfriend of 3 years is rather conservative and although she's kinky in private, often times going off on that tangent, she's clear about wanting to remain a virgin till after marriage. She initially thought I was a virgin as well. I wanted to be totally honest with her so I spilled the beans as soon as I mustered the courage. Knowing that we both liked each other already by then, it pained me to watch her deal with the shock of that information. She accepted me in the end, but I know she's still slightly bothered by it. It simply would've been better if I were a virgin as well.

Based off me and my peers' experience, i'd say that having a sexual history reduces one's eligible dating pool (with virgins). I also find that girls who are more 'traditional', 'backward', '1800s' w/e have more desirable qualities that guys would seek in someone they intend to marry and settle down with. Most likely the reverse is true as well--with voluntary virgins, that is; not too sure about bitter incels lol. 

Power to those who want to bang everything that moves; it's a personal choice after all. But if the intention is to one day settle down in a long-term monogamous relationship with a view to marriage and kids, then I think the odds of finding and retaining a suitable partner for that goal would be higher if one refrains from pre-marital sex. In the meantime, just grab your dick and double click.

Hello #55982, thank you for your insight. I am a guy and I feel ashamed of myself for having fwb too. However, there are times where I am unable to control myself and indulge in lust. I agree that girls with fwb and casual sex are not morally right. This applies to guys as well and I feel ashamed because I have constantly been in 2 fwb relationship for 16 years since secondary school.  I do not deem myself as good-looking or fit. 

When I met my ex-girlfriend and be honest with her, I told her that I have been with 2 fwb for past 13 years. We have a hard start in relationship and gladly she was understanding and forgave me. However, we still break up in the end because of character mis-match. Truly enough, the whole aim in relationship is not about considering one past or not but is to be able to live with one another, to tolerate each other nonsense and even silence between each other feels good, because being together is to enjoy each other presence. Sometimes, when I look back, why do we even bother wasting time having a bad start when ultimately we still broke up due to character mis-match and not because of my fwb. So to all those couple having a similar start as me, it does not really matter you had fwb or multiple partners. Most importantly is whether you are able to live with that person comfortably or not! 

Back to the topic, after reading your post #55982 and #56043, I feel so immorally wrong every time I am with my fwb. I am a guy and I have my needs. Sometimes, we even went to 3P.

56053,"To #55982

Hello fellow fwb hater. I see you are a person who is trying to help others by showing them what is good and what is bad. That is very admirable.

1. To clarify, in your most recent post, I cannot be sure if you are not from the 1800s, because I see time travel as very possible, probably as much as you see fwb as being morally bad. But you are correct, what does it matter if you are from the 1800s or not?

2. You answered that it is your ethics and morality that puts you on a high horse to teach others. That is also agreeable, since a science teacher has a ""right"" to teach science, and so virtuous person such as yourself has the right to teach virtue. I would like to point out however, that to think yourself as better than most people you have not met is a vice in itself, and you should be cautious not to be led astray. Please remain within the sex-field where you are an expert in.

3. There are many virtue ethics theory, and I am not too sure which you are using. You clearly have avoided piety despite it being one of the ""original"" 5 virtues but I do think piety is very important to us and possibly your argument. You may want to reconsider bringing piety back into your life to become a more virtuous person. Also, fwb would not really be a violation of temperance (it is the uncontrolled act that makes it a violation, not the actual status of it itself). I believe you would agree with me and say that fwb is morally wrong (even if you only do it once or twice), in which case may I propose that it is a violation of piety and wisdom? I don't think I need to elaborate further because it's really obvious (you may see below for what I mean by this phrase). Furthermore, ""going down this philosophical circus of asking why"" was one of the ways we eventually got to virtue ethics. So please do not overlook the method. 

I would like to ask why guys are not upheld to the same standard. ""It's really obvious"" is a very poor argument. See I could argue that the position of my remote control need not be said to every visitor to my house, because it is really obvious (IT REALLY IS!), but that tells another person nothing about where the remote control really is (it's in a basket filled with other remote controls in the centre of the living room). 

All in all, feel free to express your belief that fwb and having multiple sex partners is morally wrong. We gotta do what's best for us moral people.

Yes, it’s your body, yes it’s your right hence women should be accountable for their decision to have sex, whether this be with a single partner or multiple partners. And a reckless decision to sleep with many doesn’t grant you a medal... it just makes you look cheap and easy in the eyes of many. Forget the white knights who comment.

But in helping others u are helping yourself back as well and the person might return the favor to u. Sure the person might push up the best curve but even assuming that secaniro, what difference can one or two person make to the bell curve.

56007,Hey Life Science seniors! Can I ask if anyone has taken the module LSM4210 Topics in Biomedical Science? Can anyone share how it was and what's the type of assessment for it? Thanks guys!
56006,"#55979 Would recommend GEH1057: Materials: The Enabling Substance of Civilization.

- 2 2-hour lectures per week
- No tutorials
- No midterms
- Finals is 100% MCQ with 2-sided cheatsheet (I recently heard it was changed to open-book)
- Group project is a 10-slide powerpoint presentation on materials and their impact on human cultures, you are free to decide on the scope (no need for actual presentation, just submit the file to the lecturer.)
- Few people bid for this module compared to available quota

Bell curve is steep (100% MCQ), but if you just want to S/U, it may be the most slack GEH module you can ever find.

56003,"Girl from #55930 here. Sorry #56003, I am not your honeybee as I didn’t go staycay with my boyfriend over the weekend. Something more complicated happened.

The colleague messaged me after seeing my post to apologise for making me feel cheap. I waved it off and said it was in the past. We met up on Saturday for a meal for some innocent catchup.

During the meal, he mentioned he is now divorced after catching his ex-wife with another guy on their marital bed. Oh the irony, because we had copulated many times on that very same bed when his ex-wife was working.

After the meal, he invited me to his house for drinks. I accepted. Long story short, after many glasses of fine wine, we reconnected physically. Memories of our illicit past flowed back. Then, he was the cheater. Now, I am the cheater.

I felt guilt-wrecked after leaving his house as I made a no-sex before marriage pledge with my boyfriend. Not only have I broken that pledge, it was with the same colleague. 

That colleague has now proposed being fwbs again (he knows I am attached). 

I am conflicted. On one hand, I love my boyfriend a lot and don’t mind marrying him even though the colleague is richer, has a better body,  better looking and sexually in-sync with me. 

On the other hand, I don’t want to seem wanton by going against my no-sex pledge with my boyfriend so early (he is quite conservative) even though I have my needs. 

Should I just fwb with the colleague while technically upholding the pledge by abstaining from sex with my boyfriend? Why does life have to be so complicated?"
56002,"It's so painful... It's so painful. It's so painful to have a broken friendship with someone you were once so close to and whom you have so many mutual friends with. I can't explain to our mutual friends what the conflict is about out of the last bit of respect I have for him. It's just not for me to annouce to them that he is gay and tell them about how he confessed his love for me, how I explained that I'm straight and how when I started dating someone he simply decided to break off our friendship completely. I can't imagine how awkward it would be to see him again even with our mutual friends around. Albeit wanting to join for gatherings, I can't bring myself to join knowing that we're gonna be in each others' presence and how much old feelings it could possibly evoke again. It hurts even more when I see them having fun and yet I can't be a part of it. It hurts a lot. Can anyone relate to this.."
56001,"Hi, wondering has anyone taken EE4437 - Photonics: Principles & Applications  before? I wanted to take this module during the next semester even though im not an EE student but the information available about this module is so scarce. Hopefully there is someone out there who takes this module before can share something!

Thanks!"
56000,is it okay to marry someone out of convenience? like what if the person you really love has rejected you/married already and you’ve no choice but to just settle for anyone that loves you very much truly. When you just need someone to take care of you in the long term
