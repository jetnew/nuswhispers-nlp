65698,What do you guys normally do in graduation convocation? Like family and friends come for a short while and take photo with you that's it? I'm afraid that they will be bored...
65696,Is it normal for my bf to be scared if my parents?
65695,how does a girl differentiate if a guy is just a super friendly GCB or if he is interested in you ?
65694,why are the skillsfuture courses so completely irrelevant? are there good courses which don't cost a few hundred dollars for a few hours?
65691,"I broke up with my ex boyfriend before graduation although he is one of my best intimacy partners ever. I know this is wrong but every time he visits me for coffee after break up, we always end up doing something else. Afterawhile, I developed this guilt towards his wife and my husband. He also confessed to me that he knew what he is doing is wrong but our body refuse to reject one another that instance our fingers touched. I just want to let it out somewhere after keeping this affair for the past decade and I hope it will end soon."
65688,"Met someone at orientation, should I follow the person's Instagram. Will it seem creepy? What are instances or means to not seem creepy."
65685,"Okay so this is an actual legitimate concern regarding my social skills. I really detest ugly girls (yes I know it's extremely superficial) and I cannot actually hold conversations with them for more than a minute. I believe inner beauty exists but how do I overcome this over emphasis on looks? I am worried because I know in the future, not everyone will be good looking and I cannot avoid interacting with ugly people (bosses and clients) in the working world. I write this with a real cry for help, and I am being as honest as possible. I look forward to constructive feedback."
65683,"should I go for this event coming soon? Because I know there's a high chance I may bump into my ex there, whom I have never met in a few years. It will be a rather cosy setting in a startup-like office environment after work hours. However how should I go about approaching my ex, and will it be very awkward there? We had ended on quite bad terms last time and have never contacted till now. There would be many strangers I would be seeing at the event, some are my ex's friends/co-workers in fact. I want to pretend that I am someone attending this for sake of curiosity of the event, but I'm afraid will I come across as a stalker ?"
65680,"is it considered to be selfish to your other half if you do not want to get married so early (let's say maybe after 30 years old)? because you want to pursue a phd and do not want to be tied down by marriage so early...
if the person is about 7 years older than you and he will be almost 40 by then. 

after typing that out. i realized that my goals are really selfish and i think i have no other choice but to just let him go..."
65678,"Dear admin please post this in need of advise.

To students who have already grad from social work or currently doing social work or even students in psych or counseling. 

I’m in my 20s and I want to work with youth and so I’m thinking of pursuing a social work degree, but the issue is that through my volunteering work I realize that I may not be that suitable working with youth from broken families. 

I came from a broken family too. And so some times my own emotion gets in the way. Is that normal? There is this saying hurt people hurt people. 

What should I do?

Should I give up youth work altogether or work on my own recovery process first. And if the latter, how should i go about it? 

I dun want to study social work and then realize later tt it isn’t for me."
65676,Hi is there any GEH/GET mods that yall would recommend? Preferably chill/easy to score :-) Thanks!
65674,I'm so done waiting for my boyfriend to pop the question. How could I propose instead without making things awkward? If there are any ladies who actually have done this; you're amazing please share your secrets.
65672,"Hello, NUS Students! I would like to ask for some help, getting started a new organisation in campus. The name of the organisation is NUS Gastronomy Club. This club will be a great way to meet other students and make new friends in campus. Through this, we can interact with like-minded individuals who share common interests (food lovers). We can also contribute to both campus and community. 

Did y'all know about NTU Deli Aprecio Club and SMU Gourmet Club? I am hoping that we can form our very own club too.

NTU Deli Aprecio Club is a non-constitutional club in the University that seeks to provide a platform for their like-minded members to share, connect and understand the gastronomic culture and multiple aspects and genres of food.

The SMU Gourmet Club, which was set up in 2004 aims to gather food lovers and hunt down their favourite foods, as well as gain knowledge on the dishes’ origins and history.

To form NUS Gastronomy Club, I will have to first form the executive committee to plan with me.
If you are interested to be part of the club as an Executive Committee member (Vice President / Secretary / Financial Secretary / Deputy Fin Sec, etc), please like or comment on this post and I will contact you privately through Facebook Messenger."
65670,"To OP of #65670: I’m sorry I laughed after reading ur confession (i didn’t mean to… but it’s quite funny haha) Ok anyways, i always believe that i would be attracted to guys with cute smile, nice body etc. But surprisingly, the first thing that attracted me to my current boyfriend was his optimism, his motivation to strive, his filial self and most importantly, his eloquence. I admit, he isn't a handsome guy AT ALL, or at least not the looks that I'd prefer, and he knows it (simply cos i told him b4 hehe) but my admiration for him increased day by day. Tell you what, looks is just an exterior, go and socialise more, talk to more girls (i don't think they will shoo you if you are just being friendly). But firstly, if ur looks makes the bulk of your confidence level, u should probably go and do a makeover. Get new clothes, change your fashion style etc There are billions of people on earth and i’m sure there will definitely be one girl suited for u. Jiayou!!

P.s nobody likes being around pessimistic people bcos is simply tiring, u need to change your mindset!! Good luck bro"
65668,"To all thise criticizing singaporean women, do you just mean singaporean chinese women or singaporean women of all races?
Just wanted to clarify."
65666,"There's this guy who is really interested in me, keeps messaging me and asking me to hang out often. But the thing is he likes to talk in crude and vulgar jokes sometimes, which makes me feel very ashamed to be with him especially in public, and I even see that he puts others off easily. I'm no exception, I feel disgusted by the jokes he makes at times. In that sense, I would say he is not suited to be a 'father' type. Should I just follow my instinct and keep him as a normal friend?"
65664,"I know my gf since sec school and we are currently together for 2 years now. She was the one that first expressed her interest in me first . However, i was actually having feelings for her identical twin sister all along. 

I know her twin sister was attached and so i did not make my moves back then. Many people will wonder then how and why did i get together with my current gf. i admit i am a jerk. i got together with her because she resembles her twin sister and i thought getting together with her will fulfil my inner desire.

Fast forward, her twin sister is now single and i'm considering telling both of them the truth? But i'm afraid if i say the truth, i will lose the chance to be with both of them. what should i do?"
65661,"After going steady with my girlfriend for a couple of months, I met her extended family for the first time recently. I received a rude shock when I saw one of her first cousin’s wife. She was a girl whom I had a brief sexual fling with a few years ago but we ceased all contact after the fling. It was extremely awkward and it was obvious that she recognised me too. I kept my interaction with her to a minimum and luckily my girlfriend thought I was just being my typical antisocial self.

After the gathering, I received a message from the cousin’s wife for the first time in years as it seems like we both never changed our numbers. She asked me out for dinner and drinks and emphasised that it should be between both of us only. Should I go alone and risk a misunderstanding if my girlfriend finds out or should I bring my girlfriend along and risk having past skeletons in the closet exposed?"
65659,"Japanese Studies majors, I need your help. What is the difference between JS2213 and JS2216?"
65657,"Hi all, just wanted to say that the person reading this right now is a beautiful person. Have a great day!"
65655,"Hi all, anyone has tips on how to survive LDR during exchange? Especially for countries like the US with a very different timezone. In a serious relationship right now and I just hope that things can go as smoothly as possible during SEP."
65653,"To any course with CFG1010 Roots and Wings as a recommended optional module and an internship of 3 or 6 months is required for grad:
Don't do it unless you like reflecting on yourself. Take CFG1002 Career Catalyst instead to polish your resume and do other more practical tasks that might help you in getting the internship."
65651,"Dear people specifying/tagging Prof Ben on NUSWhispers: seriously??
He's just nice enough to comment on some posts he's interested in, or to give advice if he could. But you're making it seem obligatory for him to reply you on such an informal platform, aren't you a bit rude? Why not email him so he knows your identity too, why not have the guts to show yourself to your benefactor, to get the chance to sincerely thank him if he replies you? Please show a bit more respect and don't take advantage of anyone's kindness thanks :)"
65649,"I miss my friend.

I used to be close to this friend. He was a really good friend to me, always there for me and we always meet up because we stay so near each other. Most of the time we always meet up for dinner when we go home together and every other day we are always messaging one another.

But the thing about us is that we are from different leagues. He is the head of the council and in charge of everything and everyone, while I'm just at the bottom of the ranks where people just ignore and forget. 

He got promoted and I was genuinely happy for him. Soon enough, because of his promotion, he got more friends. Everyone was his friend. Everyone but me.

Our usual texts started dying out. We no longer see each other anymore and when we do, he no longer tries or make any effort to continue conversations or interact with me at all. It's like he became a stranger to me. It feels like he seems ashamed of our friendship.

Because we are guys, we don't usually confront each other on emotional and sensitive stuff like this. But it is killing me on the inside knowing that we drifted so far apart when we used to be so close.

I don't have many friends and for those that I consider close, they are really special to me. It hurts me everyday knowing that he is excelling with his life while I'm trying so hard to heal my heart from all the good times and memories we spent together.

I don't know what I did wrong. I just wish I could turn back time to when we were still close. When I was happy."
65647,"There was this girl I like who’s is a super high statistics character - body very glamorous, persona very cool and brain very smart also. I asked her if she would go out with me after picking up the courage, even though I’m quite a pitiful worm in comparison.

However, she said she did not see a future between us because she was 5’10” and I was only 5’6”. 

Well, obviously I was quite annoyed even though I was half-expecting this (our social standing is rather different, and I admit my own lack of self-development and confident played a big role, besides my height, or in this case my lack thereof) because I thought her personality should have been quite cool and that she wouldn’t be so fixated on our height difference.

While I now realise this was just an excuse she was giving and she wasn’t really so shallow as to reject someone purely on the basis of height, I couldn’t restrain myself at the time and angrily asked her, “What the hell? You’re rejecting me just because you are a bit taller than me? Don’t be so bloody full of yourself! You’re only 4 inches taller than me! 4 inches is so bloody short it might as well be nothing! 4 INCHES IS NOTHING!!!!”

After I said that, I was a bit disappointed with myself for having been slightly less composed than I should have been instead of taking rejecting in a calm and mature fashion, and got into a mood that can only be characterised by an overwhelming feeling of disgust and self-loathing. But the more I think about it, in the love context, while 4 inches is actually a negligible height gap, it can also be a reasonable length? Now I have conflicting thoughts on this matter...

What is your opinion, fellow denizens of NUSWhispers? Is 4 inches #perfectlyfine ?"
65645,I am a freshie taking my English QET test tmr. My location is at the NUS Multi-Purpose Sports Hall but I'm not sure how to go there after stopping at Kent Ridge mrt. I've tried searching google but still unsure which bus would take me there in the shortest possible time . Anyone knows what bus can I take from Kent Ridge MRT to get me there?
65641,Would you want to know the ugly truth or live in a pretty lie/rather you don’t find things out. I used to dig and die for truths but seeing how much truth hurts I’m starting to feel like it’s ok to just turn a blind eye sometimes. Because ultimately what’s yours will be yours and what isn’t will leave you eventually. Yes speaking from a BGR POV.
65639,"I used to think that dateless Singaporean men were just sore losers for criticizing Singaporean women. But after using Tinder, I'm beginning to realize there might be some truth to them. First of all, it is near impossible to meet single females if all your friends are married. This is just the way Singapore works.
What I discovered on Tinder was that Singaporean women are either not able to hold conversations, or have a very huge ego. If it is not a huge ego, it is a very fragile one. I thought if I matched with women who were from NUS, they might be more capable of holding conversations. I graduated from NUS, so I know what girls are like, right? Turns out, even the NUS graduates cannot hold conversations. Simple things like,""which movie do you like and why?"" A simple answer would do like,""I like Dog of Isles, it is a love letter to Japanese culture.""
I give such an answer, and local women struggle to reply me. I feel like my conversations with them must be like,""oh i had dinner with my friends on Saturday, and lunch with my parent on Sunday. Then we watch movie in the night."" If i ask Singaporean women what they think about other women, they say, ""I don't know, I don't know. I don't want to judge."" I ask Chinese, Malaysian or Vietnamese women the same question, they can tell me a lot. ""We come from a village, so we learn to be independent.""
I suspect that this may not be an education level issue. It could be a nation-wide issue. Somehow our local work culture destroys the citizens' social skills. You might say I must be ugly, and so no one wants to chat with me. But I have been chatting with women from other countries, most of them are prettier than the local women I talk to. Some of them come from business families, with thriving businesses in countries much bigger than Singapore. They are not economically weak women looking for a man to support them. None of them has scammed me or asked me to send them money. It could be that the standard of what is handsome here is different from the rest of Asia.
Those who want to comment, I'd ask you to think about what is wrong with our society. Is narcissism a growing issue? Does our work environment kill our social skills?
Please do not spew hate on any gender or sexuality. Someone give me an objective opinion."
65637,My gf wants to study overseas in a course that will take 5/6 years. She'll be back maybe once or twice a year. we normally meetup quite often so idk if I'll be able to handle being in a ldr. Is there any tips or advice as I know I would have frequent days where I would be super down due to missing her.
65635,"Hi all! I am from the minority race. I have always been attracted to girls of a different race from mine as I find that they are more open and I am able to interact with them easily.  There are other factors too but I will just keep it short. As I believe the differences in religion might be an issue if I get in a relationship, I have not pursue this any further. Would appreciate if you guys could give some advice."
65630,"I feel like I'm pretty lazy in NUS. I usually crash after I return to my RC everyday after my CCAs, project meetups and social gatherings, and feel extremely unmotivated to revise and do my assignments. It doesn't help when my friends jio me for supper nearly every night, or a game of Frisbee. And the thing is, I know I should probably be saying ""no"" and doing some revision, but I don't ever feel the desire to reject them at all. After all, I don't have much motivation in studying and simply want to do the bare minimum to get my degree, while enjoying the numerous social opportunities around me.

I feel like I'm so laid back in general, and being in a semi-competitive course (pharmacy) makes me see all my batchmates studying hard, yet I don't feel a tinge of regret for choosing the hedonistic path of ""instant gratification"" - by prioritizing having fun over studying, any day. My CAP is floating above a 4.0, and I don't have any desire to push myself any harder. I mean, I just want a degree. If there's a test, I just do some last minute binge-studying and scrape past. But if there's no test, I definitely won't want to enrich myself with some ""additional studying"". Basically, I'm studying only for the sake of studying.

This way of studying is probably only going to cause me to have a very shallow and superficial understanding of my content, if I actually still remember them after graduation. Any tips on how to motivate myself to study?"
65628,"Similar to #65596, I have also rejected many guys due to what I believe is my sexual orientation. Agreed that I shouldnt be wasting their time in leading them to believe there's hope in being more than just mere friends. However, the people around me in school don't seem to suspect it because of my appearance and behaviour, also the fact that I'm surrounded by a good balance of friends with opposite and same gender. When they ask me 'why have not you found a bf yet', I just say I am a picky person and haven't found anyone suitable yet, which is kind of true in a way, all this just to avoid their further questioning."
65627,"I'm a freshie and I've fallen hard for this senior from the hall that rejects me(Im hall-less), only seen her once and didn't talk much....but we do text though albiet not everyday. Should i ask her out ? I know I'm not in her league but she's really special to me"
65625,"Can NUS engineering please wake up their idea? Just got an email from a prospective employer. Apparently they go through resumes with a fine-toothed comb. I put my dean's list award for multiple semesters in my resume, and they say they weren't able to find verification online. When I searched the link to the dean's list page on google it's a broken link. Apparently my friend said it's been like that for more than a year already??? What are we even paying so much school fees for?

Anyway I managed to resolve it by sending them scanned versions of the certificate. It was very alarming though because they were subtly insinuating I was lying on my resume."
65623,"hello everyone, I plan to go on exchange in y3s1 but i heard that usually gpa 4.0 and above will be guaranteed a spot. my gpa is 3.8 after my first year and are there any universities that are less popular that i will have a higher chance to get in? is it also true that i have almost no chance of getting into a korean university as i heard korea is extremely popular... pls help thanks!!!"
65622,"My boyfriend is very much into getting physical, touching and kissing.... it is kind of excessive and things are moving too fast as we just started getting into the relationship.... is this normal??? Should there be some boundaries drawn????"
65621,"Does anyone have any advice as to whether it makes sense to pursue a Masters in Electrical or Computer Engineering after completing a Bachelors in Computer Science? Or does a Masters in CS make more sense?

I’m doing very well in my CS program in a t10 uni (for CS) in the states. One thing I’ve been realizing during my internships (as I hear about various projects) is that there are a lot of interesting problems requiring hardware expertise that I can’t tackle as a pure CS major. 

I’m at a crossroads where I could do a masters in electrical or computer engineering - though I wonder if I’d be in over my head doing this given that I haven’t touched any actual hardware stuff (apart from what I learned about processors and OS, if that counts.) Thanks!"
65620,"guys, how do yall know if your girl friends ever liked you? Were there signs if any, and did yall catch on to the signs? Or yall didnt know until the girl friend surprise attack and tell you she likes you haha?"
65614,"Both me and my gf are in our late twenties. We have been dating  for about 5 years and are planning to get married soon. Both of us get along very well and she is very nice to me and my family. But here’s one problem. Im starting to develop feelings towards my gf mum last year. 

As I lost my mum at a very young age, I always look upon to my gf mum for advice. I don’t know if this is Pure love or motherly love?

Ps: both my gf parents are only in their late forties"
65612,Isn't it pointless for NUS to rename class of honours to highest/distinction/merit when students/professors/employers still refer to it as the former..
65610,Dean’s list is based on pre-/post-SU cap? Can prof or anyone pls confirm it? Some on deans list told me it’s post-SU cap coz you cant SU ur core mods and you need at least 16MCs (iirc) . Thanks!
65609,"Dear Prof Ben Leong,

Is it better for non-SOC students to take CS3216 after completing CS1010?"
65608,Anyone took SC2213 Childhood and Youth? What are the assessment criteria like?
65607,"How do people not run out of things on dates ? I keep running out of ideas after my planned part is over. I feel like I cannot keep her entertained and she's bored of me. I know naturally I'm quite boring compared to most of the guys out there. I recognise that I'm also not very good looking etc so I know I need to work harder and compensate. As the one chasing, the onus is inevitably on me right ? To make the date or outing go well....

Any tips guys ? Or should both Parties contribute ? If she doesn't contribute is that a subtle hint that she's not interested ? Or maybe she's as boring as I am?"
65603,"NUS alumni here. I work in a local e-commerce startup. Most of my colleagues are either from China, or Chinese from other parts of the world. Usually I wouldnt mind being a minority. In fact I don't even mind that they excluded me from social activities so that they wouldn't have to worry about ordering food for my dietary restrictions. 

But what really annoys me is that people end up speaking in mandarin when discussing in meetings and I miss out because I clearly don't speak the language. A lot of them cannot speak English, or at least not well enough to express their ideas. 

This wouldn't be such a huge issue until my leader actually admitted to avoiding hiring from specific cultures because in his own words, they're not as hardworking or productive as the Chinese.

Usually I would speak up against racism, but my job stability will definitely be at risk if I disagree with the leader. 

I don't really know what to do."
65602,Should we ban Singlish in universities and insist that people speak and write in standard English? I've seen that the level of English spoken and written by many people here is not up to standard. It is even more prevalent in local workplaces. I believe raising the standard of English in universities would benefit students when they graduate and join the workforce next time.
65601,"Pls pls I wish everyone would stop asking me why I am still single. It’s my personal decision and I have my own reasons for it, why can’t they just accept my life choices? people say that I am pleasant looking and sociable, but that’s doesnt mean they shld just assume that I am attached..."
65600,"I am just really annoyed. There was this guy that asked me out. Yes, I was a bit not into dating. Yes, I took a day to think and reply. After finally taking a lot if courage I decide to go ahead. And what does he do? He completely forgets on the date. I cant seem to understand what he is trying to do? Does anyone have any idea what’s with this guy and should I ever go out with him again?"
