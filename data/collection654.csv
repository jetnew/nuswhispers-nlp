65496,"I am a non-christian guy and I am falling for a very faithful christian girl. While we were at an overseas exchange, a group of us gathered and played games. Her friend asked her who she would want to kiss most and she pointed at me. She would always laugh at my jokes despite being really lame n cold sometimes. Does that mean that there is a chance that she likes me? Will it be possible to be together with our different religious background?"
65494,Hello! Please like this post if there is a baking/cooking club and you will be interested to join.
65493,"By any measure, I should be considered successful.

I'm relatively popular (have many friends and no enemies) among my cohort, I'm academically successful, and I have stable job prospects after graduation.

Naturally, most of my friends and acquaintances think that I should be a happy person. I've even had one person tell me that she looks up to me, which really made my day.

But I've been reflecting on my life over the past few months, and somehow I don't feel happy.

Everywhere I look, people seem to better off than I am. Some of them are blissfully attached, some of them are much more physically attractive, some of them have better job prospects (or are better financially equipped), some of them are massively more popular than I am, and some are simply much smarter than I am.

It's almost as if I feel lonely or even inadequate.

I know, I should appreciate what I have. I'm fortunate enough to have such supportive coursemates and not having to worry about my own finances while studying in NUS.

But I can’t help but feel anxious that at the age of 25, there’s still so much left to do. And this makes me feel so tired all the time.

I’ll admit, some of this is my fault. Perhaps I don’t exercise as much as I should, or I don’t invest enough time in personal grooming, or I don’t work hard enough in socialising or networking with others. (There’s nothing I can do about intelligence, though.)

Or am I asking for too much from life?"
65492,"So I knew this lady on CMB and we were texting for a few days. Usually I don't meet matches in person until a certain level of comfort (2-3 weeks), and yesterday, she asked me to meet up for dinner in the weekend.

Being honest, I told her that I am slower to warm up as I am a bit more introverted. She kind of snapped, saying she ""ain't rushing to meet me or anything"", ""not a keyboard warrior and don't want to waste time"" and ""it's just casual meet up"" and proceed to block me Telegram.

To be honest, I'm quite surprised by this reaction and didn't know if I said anything wrong. If you are reading this, do accept my apologies for wasting your time but honestly it was nice chatting with you. My fault for being slow to warm up."
65491,"Theres this guy who would ask me out on dates  frequently nowadays, but when we meet up, I just feel like there is nothing much to be said. We are not able to talk about mundane things like what other friends would do, and the whole convo feels very unnatural for me. Should I keep up with these dates where he would try to impress me with fancy restaurants and all, or just forget about this person and find someone else who I can communicate with better?"
65488,"First of all, I want to say that I love my girlfriend very much. I’ve been in a few relationships, but this is by far the best and the most healthy and so we are both very happy. 

But for a while something in the relationship has been bothering me and I need to seek advice. But I will not end the relationship because it isn’t that serious. 
My gf has tendency to overreact to things. She will always remember as though the tiniest of things is a major deal and that it is a massive inconvenience, such as the food stall not having here favourite food. And then when I try to console her she tell me I don’t understand ber and she proceed to get into a bad mood and sometimes even not talk to
Me. 

What is the best way to approach this. As sometimes it make me feel useless and like I’m not getting through to her."
65487,What's the type of profile photos / content that will intrigue guys to swipe right and start conversations with you on dating apps? I've been getting tons of matches but a lack of conversation starters. Female here fyi.
65483,"when I was younger, I was bullied a lot in school because my mother worked as a cleaner in the same place I studied at. I’m not too certain when, but somewhere along the line, I started feeling inferior to my peers. I admit, I was ashamed of my mother. I was ashamed that she had to scrub toilets and that she always smelled so bad because she sweat so much. I was ashamed because she always had to work so much for so little.

To make things worse, my mother and I have a 40 year age gap. We’ve never seen eye-to-eye on anything since I was young. She has a temper and so do I. We fight more than we talk. After many years, my embarrassment gradually turned into resentment and anger, and this resentment anger was targetted specifically only on my mother. My father is a cleaner too, but I’m okay with that. I’m not sure why my mother is the target of my rage and that kills me.

I know all of you are probably thinking that I’m a bad daughter and that it doesn’t matter how my mother is earning her money. And yes - I do agree. I know that my rage towards my mother is not justified and completely immature, but I just don’t know what the hell is wrong with me.

It might come as a surprise to you guys but I actually respect my mother to bits. She managed to support me all the way to where I am now. Heck, I’m the only person that made it into university in the whole family (including my cousins). My grades are good and in all honesty, my mother has never shortchanged me in any way.

I wear pretty clothes while my mother has not bought a single piece of clothing for the past 20 years. I’ve gone on trips with my friends to countries like Taiwan and Korea but my mother does not even have a passport. I spend $30-40 per meal when I eat out with my friends and my mother can’t even bear to spend $1 buying a drink for herself. 

I can see all this, yet I still feel so much anger towards her and I don’t know why. She’s a fantastic mother and I always tell myself to hold it in even when I’m ticked off by her but for some reason, I always end up yelling at her and feeling guilty as hell for the next few days. What hurts me the most is, after a few days, she goes back to being that nice mother that she has always been, yet I’m still that rude and ungrateful brat who can’t change. I believe I’m rotten to the very core. I want to show her that I love her, but I’m so consumed by anger.

This vicious cycle of anger resulting in guilt is killing me. On one hand, I want to be close to my mother. I want her to know that I’ll never be able to love someone as much as I love her. Yet, on the other hand, I believe it’s best if I keep my distance from her. This way, she won’t be unnecessarily hurt by my remarks just because I have unfounded anger management issues. What should I do...?

p.s. please feel free to criticise me. I deserve it. My mother forgives me unconditionally despite all the hurt that I’ve ever brought upon her and her forgiveness suffocates me. I drowning in guilt. scold me, berate me, at least for my mother. I need it."
65482,"To poster:65459

Yes, my bf does exactly the same things as yours... sometimes he can be quite scary tbh..I’ve been in this for a few years..and I have to say it progressively gets worse, but you just feel so trapped. I’m trapped and I trapped myself in this because I did not stand up earlier. Now I have difficulty reversing the damage because I did not put my foot down. He gets mad at me for talking back, but I don’t care anymore, I’m not his punching bag and you just got to show them  you have self-respect. Because I can promise you over time these anger outbursts will take a hit on your emotional and psychological well being as it is happening to me right now... but I’m fighting back now. My self esteem and self worth was completely shattered over time and now all I have left is to pick up the pieces and build myself up again. Don’t tolerate it. Don’t manage it or try to live with it. Don’t compromise the integrity of your feelings, it will be harder to hold over time and it will reap nothing but anger and frustration within. You will regret. Fight back now."

65468,"My friends frequently tell me that it is extremely important to expand your network while in college. I have always thought that while it is true to some extent, I thought I have always thought it's more important to form a small number of meaningful connections and learn a proper skill. There is probably no right answer to this, and either paths will have trade-offs. How crucial is networking actually in the long run? For the seniors who spent more time socialising while in school, how has this helped you progress in your careers?"
65467,"Replying to #65416, amazing to see how people think its always the man's duty to pursue or follow up. Some snowflakes think that there own example demonstrates that the op is wrong. If you read the post very carefully, you'll see that the op is complaining about women not putting in the effort that they themselves expect men to put in. Why do women drop out or start complaining if the man expects the same that they do? I think its perfectly reasonable that the op expects women to do their part well. As for the idiots who say they dont you anything, well if there arent any obligations then why should the guy be obligated to be polite? If no party owes anyone anything then the guy might as well start with a  dick pic and a lewd joke."

There are many awkward silences and we are both struggling to find something to talk about. Even text conversations feel difficult too. I want to talk or text him very badly, but every time either of us starts a conversation, I feel frustrated that it does not develop into a meaningful one. I will end the conversation, only to miss talking to him again afterwards, and the cycle repeats itself. Is this a sign of incompatibility?"
65462,Is it uncommon to take double minors? Please do share your experience. I intend to take another major but there is only a minor offered for the subject I wanted so I was thinking of 'topping up' with another minor.
65459,"Hi all, I am the poster of #65459. Thanks all for the advice. Maybe I should give more context on the situation. Like all relationships, we had our fair share of arguments. There was one particularly intense argument where he raised his voice at me when he was clearly in the wrong (it was something math related). After which he explained that the reason he reacted that way was because he felt inferior (due to our different education levels) and wanted to be ""right for once"". We have talked about this and resolved it, just that I can't seem to forget this incident. However, throughout most part of the relationship, he was a super caring boyfriend who watches out for my every need, tries to be accommodating and make handmade gifts for me every now and then. The only concern that I have is his reaction whenever he gets angry or frustrated. He would tend to vent his anger on non living objects, such as punching the wall and breaking his own items etc. When he plays games and loses, he will bang his keyboard in frustration. (I think this is quite common among guys who play games?) I have spoken to him about it (yes, I was concerned of potential violence in the future) but he assured me that he would never hurt me physically and would not even think of it. 

I do see a future with him as I love him a lot and he is really a sweet guy in general. We are even planning for our future together. Is this considered an anger management issue even if it doesn't happen often? Can it be resolved?"
65449,So annoyed by my friends who always urge me to buy crypto such bitcoin. They think they are so ‘Atas’ just by owning a few thousands of bitcoin. I believe in crypto but you don’t have to talk about it every day. I own ethereum but i dont tell people to buy just to raise the price. Focus on studying and completing the degree first

Reason being, both my gf and my dog always excludes me, leaving me to literally netflix and chill alone in the corner of a living room, while they are cuddled up at the other end of the sofa. He gets up immediately and follows her whenever and wherever she goes. And it doesnt help when he is a male, just like me!!! So jealous. All her attention is on him and she doesnt even know im writing this confession. Plus the best thing is he still got the cheek to climb up my bed and sleep beside me after she's gone.

Im considering to get a female dog to accompany my current one, so that he will not interfere my rs with my gf. Hmmm will it actually work?"
65441,"Take this post with a grain of salt

I feel that if you are wondering if you should confess to your crush or not, you shouldn't.

Why do you want to confess and make her your girlfriend? 
What is wrong the current situation between and her?

If you are unsatisfied with your current situation with her and wish for a change of situation by confessing, this means that you don't really like her. What you like is your idea of her becoming your girlfriend.

If you truly like her for the person she really is, you will be enjoying your current interaction with her and won't see the need for any changes."

Now, I haven’t talked to her much in the past few years but I feel like I should do something as a friend. Thinking of how to approach this delicate topic or just not approach it at all when i meet her the next time. It honestly pains me to see a usually happy girl who has to go through this shit.

Just like the movie ' Passengers ' , I had this selfish desire . With nobody else , I wanted to live with you like they both did in the spaceship .

I believe we were meant for one another , you were my belief . There will never be another guy in my life that I yearn for , you can't be replace . I love you , I do ... if there's a slight possibility I want to be your loving wife taking care of you without fail . -A"

I am (probably) the only one who is sensitive about having my ugly facial expressions being turned into a frequently used sticker.

We shouldn’t have such a conservative mindset, such a mindset can hold us back. We’re consenting about the activity, and at the same time we can have fun, so there’s no issues. I strongly recommend everyone here to try it themselves."

I find it hard to tell him straight because I know it'd hurt his feelings. 

Before you ask, I'll just say that I've suggested things to him before and told him I'd like it if he surprised me sometimes or that it'd be nice if we tried some new things. 

I've never compared him to anyone, although I have offhandedly mentioned about my friend's sex life without thinking too much. 
 
It's frustrating because I have my own needs too, but I really love him and I'm afraid this will cause me to start looking outside of the relationship for sexual satisfaction.

65407,"Have seen a couple of interns in this school holiday. Some advice even though it should be basic professional conduct, or common sense in my view. Generation gap is catching up with me.

1.  Be polite to everyone, including cleaners, administrative assistant, non-managerial colleagues. Focusing on networking and choosing specific people to be friendly to will result in being frowned by people who you are fawning over.
 
2. Focus on the tasks you are hired for and not the tasks you want to do, otherwise don't take up the internship. Don't tell your non-supervisors you would be interested to know more about B-Z, when you cannot even do your primary task.

3.No one asks his colleagues how he could become the CEO, land a dream job, earn 10k/month in the first week of his internship

4. Assumption is silly when you have not worked in the industry before. Learn to correct your assumptions after people have told you more than 2 times. 

5. Give your name when people ask for your name. I don’t want to know the way you think it is cooler to say your name. Don’t tell me AK unless you are a rifle.  

6. Don’t fall asleep at the workplace.

7. Don’t PDA with other interns at the workplace.

8. Behave like a normal human being and assimilate into the environment, the interviews are over long ago. If you are viewed as normal in your community, don’t behave overly different at the workplace. I suffered multiple internal combustion when people ask questions such as “what are the most important attributes one should have” during lunch time. Tempted to reply “don’t ask stupid questions”."
65406,"Hey guys I need a little advice, it concerns my girlfriend, my friends and my gaming.

My friends and I have been gaming together for a while now, and my girlfriend is also a gamer, but she was gaming before we got together. After we got together, she joined my group of friends and I in our ""static"" group (so we play together as a fixed group of people to do raids and stuff together).

However, we are different from other fairytales. I am not a tank and she is not my healer, we are both damage classes (DPS). I want to start off by stating that she is a good player. She is decent with her rotations and cooldowns, and she is also well geared. However, strangely, her output DPS is never anywhere near top level. On paper, she does around half the damage than our top DPS does. Ironically, she has the class with the highest sheet DPS. I have tried practising with her many times but I cannot teach her the awareness of when to use what procs and how to time other stuff.

I am the raid leader so I am usually the one monitoring the DPS meters, and there has been a growing unhappiness due to the lack of raid DPS. We managed to clear all the end-game content, but we barely did so before the end of the season. We have really struggled a lot. However, a new season is upon us and some of my friends are considering leaving to form a new static group. My girlfriend does not know this, of course. Like she knows that her DPS is lower than is expected but not to the extent that it is dragging us down with our progression. We all love gaming and I hope that this group can stay together, however it looks increasingly difficult because she refuses to learn other classes as she is only familiar and only willing to be familiar with this one.

Looking ahead, I am even considering just quitting gaming just so I can get out of this conundrum (whether my friends leave, or if we continue together but there is continuous unhappiness). Appreciate any advice going forward.

P.S. B I hope that if you read this, you know that I am not giving up on you, but it's because I want all this to continue"

Her response: ""WHY ARE YOU SO JUDGEMENTAL""


IMO girls should date short guys cause
1. He probably won't cheat on you
2. You don't have to worry about him cheating on you
3. He probably can outlive you. Tall guys are said to die younger (I'm not kidding. If you don't believe me, feel free to do your own research)
4. He is probably the most romantic guy ever
5. He will make sure that you're happier than him.
6. His junk is probably 20CM long and thick AF????. You never try, you never know.(Probably can last for more than 30 minutes or even longer)
7. More importantly girls, you will be his world.  

So girls please give us short guys a chance. Love is love. If your love is superficial, you will end up breaking up; or worst a divorce. Ignore what you see on TV and social norms."
