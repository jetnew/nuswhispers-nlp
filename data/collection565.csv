56598,Hello! Anyone took ch1101e last sem? Could you kindly leave some feedback about the module? Thanks in advance!
56597,"To #56597:

I have the exact same sentiments. For as long as I can remember, I've always asked myself what is the purpose of life? Why should I stay alive if ultimately I am going to die anyway? I've posed these questions to my friends and even a counsellor and their answers have never been satisfactory. 

But over the years, I have learned to cope with this ""existential crisis"". Since I don't know my purpose of living, I tell myself that I'll challenge myself and FIND my purpose to live. Maybe you can try doing this too?

And ignore those who do not understand your plight. They are not you and will never understand what you are going through. Don't let them invalidate your feelings! All the best. :) "
56596,"i have found someone who is very compatible with me, in terms of character, beliefs, humour etc (things that you can't see). however, we don't look compatible in terms of physical features at all (height, size, looks). 
i definitely see a future with him, but not sure if he feels the same. but ... as much as i hate to admit it, i am afraid of what other people think and what they might say in the future. i am physically larger than him and it really sucks because society has always expected the man to be bigger than the woman... that kind of nonsense.  also, he is better looking than me, kind of out of my league, i feel kind of insecure when girls look at him... 

haiz after writing this post, perhaps i have found my answer and i should just let him go because i am not even confident about myself and i dont want to ruin his life... "
56595,Can anyone share if it's recommended to take nm1101e?

56593,"Hello FASS seniors and fellow freshies! Y1S2 is about to begin and so many people have already submitted their major declarations... I am undecided about what I want to pursue and it's giving me a lot of anxiety :( 

I really do love Philosophy but when I suggested majoring in it to my parents, I was shot down immediately. So maybe as a minor? And the other exposure modules I took in Sem 1 (PS and SE) don't peak my interest so I have to take more general exposure modules.... 

Has anyone tried Global Studies??? What's it like? And for seniors already in GL, what's the workload like? Is it possible to double major or take a minor at the same time without dying in  a pool of my own tears???? Asking for a friend :----)

56590,"Hi, I would like to get advise on rejecting a friend.

We have the same group of friends and we were quite close in sch. Some time ago I realised that he's interested in me as he told some of my friends. But I had already made it very clear to all my friends that I am not interested in r/s's. So I started to give minimal and less enthusiastic replies to his messages but he didn't get those. So I ghosted him but he then confronted me about it. 

I didn't want to reject him when he haven't actually said he liked me, embarrassing the both of us. (+the possibility of our group outings to turn awkward because of that). But just when I thought he had finally gotten the hint he got more ""aggressive"" and keeps messaging me about random things everyday. He even asks questions like ""how has your day been?"" and ""do u want to have lunch together sometime?"" and ""where are you now?"" 

Also he keeps initiating body contact like touching my shoulders and upper arms, and I am very uncomfortable with it.  

TLDR; how to reject a friend who did not get/ignored previous hints dropped by u but has the same social circle as u?? And stop him from having skin contact with you.....

Little did they know that after one semester of CS, heck even after 1 year, they still cannot ""create"" anything. Becos the core of CS is not to teach app or web development. Many ppl just simply assume that taking CS = create apps and website and become a millionaire, which is simply not the main purpose of a CS education.

56575,"Would like to get some career advice as well! Been almost 4 years since I graduated from NUS Chem and I've been thinking of doing a post grad in biological sciences. The common advice from my peers and seniors at work (pharma industry) is to do a PhD instead of a Msc but I'm wondering if I'll even gain entry to a PhD programme when my background isn't relevant to biology to begin with. 

I am also concerned that a PhD would limit my job options when I get out from school. I'm still interested in lab work but a lot of the PhDs at work seem to be stuck doing paperwork and reading journal articles, which isn't really what I ultimately want to do. I'm definitely not interested in going into academia or teaching, so is a PhD even worth the time and effort? Or maybe I should just do a MSc first?"

56563,"Hello! I need some advice with regards to my studies.

I'm a freshman majoring in Mathematics, but I'm always at a loss whenever someone asks me what I want to be in the future. Honestly, I chose math 'cause I'm good at it and am confident to get at least A- in MA modules... but career-wise, I'm not so inclined towards banking/finance-related jobs, and after experiencing the horrors of high school I don't know if I want to be in the education sector.

Which is why I'm thinking of picking up a minor, to hopefully equip me with the knowledge and skills in other industries. In particular, I'm interested in the drug-manufacturing industry and am considering to take a minor in pharm sci. But I'm not sure how useful this would be? How difficult is it to get a job in the drug-manufacturing industry?

On the other hand, I might consider taking a minor in CS too, since my I did well for my CS1010S. Should I minor in CS instead? (Or maybe switch majors?)

TLDR: How's the drug-manufacturing industry like right now and in the future? Will a minor in pharm sci help me to land a job in that industry?

Thank you everyone and happy new year 2019!"

56561,"It is common wisdom that the civil service emphasises more on honours classification compared to private sector during hiring. What is unclear are the defining characteristics of graduates from each category. Having worked with over 50 graduates, an admixture of first class honours, seconds and the occasional valedictorian, maybe I can shed a better light on this matter.

In general, firsts are way more productive than their peers over the long run. This is because they are able to identify deeply hidden issues and solve them well before they unfold into a terrible mess. Or offer a seemingly innocuous solution which attack a problem from multiple fronts. For example, there was a first on my team who discovered an O(nlog(n)) technique to accelerate an O(n^2) computational bottleneck which has persisted in some of our systems for years. This allows the product to work with larger datasets and have better performance. Firsts are suited for highly complex tasks and open-ended problems. For repetitive tasks, they perform no better than the rest. Firsts are slightly lower in trait conscientiousness and may not successfully follow through with a prolonged task. There is no significant difference between valedictorians and firsts.

Second uppers are highly intelligent and reasonably conscientious, making them suitable for technical teamwork. They are not as adept as firsts in identifying root causes of difficult problems, or offer novel solutions that are able to substantially cut costs or increase revenues over the long run. Given a reasonable objective with no major hiccups, they can bring projects to successful fruition.

Second lower and below is where productivity becomes negative for non-trivial technical work. The cost of training and losses incurred due to poor design choices can easily outweigh the value that is delivered. They are more suited for repetitive work with moderate deviation from SOP. It's not all gloom and doom though, some of the most reliable team members that I can count on falls within this category."

56543,"I'd love to hear Prof. Ben Leong's career advice.

I spent most of my 20s working in low paid jobs (6 years as a research assistant at NUS and another year at startups), and earned a Masters as well. I finally landed a relatively well-paying data science / data engineering job at a finance firm when i was nearly 30, where I have been for the last 3 years. 

I'm now trying to figure out what's next for me. The most appealing option right     is to actually start to independent contracting as a data science / machine learning developer. I already have prospective clients lined up. My day job has gotten to a point where I barely need to work 5-10 hours a week to be effective, so i certainly have enough time and bandwidth for pursuing side contracts. 

If it goes well, I'm contemplating rebranding myself as an independent developer who always works on a contract basis. I regularly get inquiries and job offers for senior dev / tech lead roles, and I feel like there is a fairly good chance of being able to parlay them into independent contracts.

Now come the financial considerations: this route seems quite lucrative, at least in the short term. My day job pays 200k a year. The 2 prospective clients for the side gig can pay 200k / 100k each, so i'll probably earn around 400-500k all in. If I quit my job and go independent, I'm hoping to keep at least 2 clients at a time and make ~ 450k a year on average.

My concern is if this is a good long term move. Will doing this hurt my prospects of moving up the corporate ladder? Do I risk stretching myself too thin and burning out in the long term? Would it be better for me to shore up my interviewing skills and try to land a job in one of the GAFAs? As an independent dev, my income ceiling probably around 400-500k: will I lose out on potentially earning more than that in a corporate setting? Should I build up more of a history of working in industry before trying independent contracting?

I must add that I don't want to work in the US, because I don't want to deal with their immi.

56539,"[WARNING: Long post] Hi everyone, I have been a reader of NUSWhispers since the NUS-Confessions day and this post is dedicated to those whose CAP is below 3 in SOC. //Cannot use the term struggling cos there are who complain that they are struggling for FCH and I was just struggling to get Bs back then

A little about myself: I graduated from SOC in 2003 and still have memories of modules like CS1231, CS1232, CS1101, CS1102 (my days only got java, no Python), CS2012, CS2013 , CS2014, CS2015, CS2016, CS3103, CS3243 (AI at my time no deep learning and machine learning), CS3214 (java web application, those days no iOS and Android) and some others that I cannot remember. Most importantly, I was tanking the bottom of the bell curve throughout my 3 years in SOC. My CAP was 2.38 in Y1S1 and I graduated with a CAP of 3.15 om Y3S2. 

My time also no option of S/U and also no Prof Ben. He joined NUS in 2014++ and was probably in MIT doing my NUS days if I remember correctly. So you guys are really fortunate compared to my time. Things could have been different for me if I had S/U option then. Anyway, I have been working in sales (Non-IT related) since I graduated. I dun earn a lot but I draw a reasonable income (between 100K to 150K per annum for the last 7-8 years)

My main message to those who will probably miss 2nd lower class honour and below is this: Dun be despair cos the CS training will STILL give you a competitive edge in life WHEN you are working outside IT industry. You just have to start with a lower position and pay as your degree may not be relevant in the new industry. The CS skill that you have will make you realised that things can be done more efficiently than they already are once you understand how the system works. This will enable you to be a valuable asset in the company because you are able to do so much more compared to many of your fellow colleagues with the same time given

If you are going to be working for an organisation, then I would recommend these you pick up excel skill (VBA or formulas). Working with big CSV files and functions such as vlookup, match, indirect, create a variable range and privot tables are just a few that really help you in your work. Your CS1101 training will enable you to create Excel sheets that are ""very impressive"" to other but just actually ""so-so"" to you.

If you are going to be self-employed or startup. Then learn about web hosting with WordPress, SEO (make sure you read on the black hats too!),  Facebook marketing, video marketing. You can also learn about business analytics and Microsoft Power BI but I feel that they are only useful for big organisations with lots of data.

Lastly, dun forgot how to code. I am using selenium in java and PDF library to automate boring tasks and prepare data for my presentations nowadays. It really saves me a lot of time and yet impresses my clients 

TLDR: Not doing well in CS is not the end of the world. The closing of one door is just an opening to another. If you are going to miss the FCH and 2nd upper, why not consider building some of the skill that I have mentioned above? Study what interests you (like I did) for the remaining modules and you would enjoy more of your uni life. At least got more time BGR right!

56538,"Hi, I'm a Science undergrad hoping to transfer to SDE (Industrial Design) next year. Just received my CAP, and it's around 4. What are my chances of successfully transferring to ID?

If you:
- Like thinking about abstract concepts
- Like problem solving
- Like spoon-feeding a computer every single instruction
- Have the passion, dedication and commitment to spend hours in front of the computer trying to debug, reason or otherwise, understand why something that should not fail, fail
- Have no social life

56504,"Hi Juniors, the same Graduated Senior here who warned potential tech bubble & hiring freeze that will impact students hoping to be  be a tech professional.


Since the post garner sizable likes for a serious post & I assume that there is an interest to understand the whole industry bubble formation and collapse. Let you judge yourself if you are still not convinced. Those who haven't read the previous post ; I have first and experience before as a chemical engineering graduate who saw the oil market crash when I was graduating and  I was my Friends who lost their job in the first 3 months of graduation.

It generally start with generally start with some technology innovation (lik shale gas extraction or cheap computing power enabling deep learning) , or the government wants to introduce or drive a new sector ( like the smart nation initiative ) to climb the economic ladder where the country shift from primary & secondary sector to tertiary & quarternary sectors. You may have heard the line somewhere ""we must be innovation driven nation"". It is  a natural progression for economies.

Then the market players & new companies form and come in the country and the professional command a high salary simply because the lack of necessary talent. Initiative are made to train talent into the industry like skillfutures to meet the market need. The high salary and hype/glamour generated by the industry attracts careers switches and students into the industry. 

Universities later coming into fill in the gap with new courses and increased cohort size. Now we have biz analytics , last time we had quantitative finance introduced prior to the 2008 financial crisis. You see the hype and hear mouth watering salary that your seniors told you and it drives young people into the course. You see indicative grade profile shooting up for the course. Look at CS course over the past ten years. Students start dreaming of the bring future wait for them. Being unnecessarily cocky. 

Your senior's salary is not an indicator of your salary. (At least for most of you)
 
Then, the bubble matures as more & more people come in. The industry then has enough talent to be super competitive given the abundances of talent. You can see how hard is the exams to join some of the companies even though the job is not that hard. Innovation slows downs and market overvalues the companies.

Later, for some reason bubble pops like oil bubble was the shale gas and OPEC price war. 2008 crisis was the ugly mortgage back securities held by banks. Something will happen and the companies become more conservative and cost their cosr. Aka layoffs, buy companies that didn't do well and fire excess staff & cut down graduate hiring. Why you need graduate when you have so many professionals available to choose from.

I'm point is simple. Don't join any course merely because it is hot. Someone gonna get burnt. If I asked my grandparents, they will say shipping but you get the point.
At any moment of time there will be a hot industry. in the past, various industries had been hot, shipping chemical sectors, microelectronics,  pharma , finance and now tech. Your seniors salaries has not bearing on you. Finally, don't be cocky. You are not the one earning those salary:p

56502,"We first met at a lab session during our first year when you asked me a question about the session and I could not answer it. I was too mesmerised by your big beautiful eyes at that time. We started talking and then dating and we celebrated my birthday together that year. You bought for me a chocolate cake which is the best cake I have ever had. We did so many things together and watched each other grew up - from poor undergraduates to working professionals. We supported each other - or rather u supported me more than I did for you. 

And I regret it wholeheartedly. I should have been there for you every day, every minute, every second. I should have treasured you more than I did every day, every minute, every second. I should have told you that I love you every day, every minute, every second. 

I wonder if you know about the numerous nights that I have cried to myself to sleep because I regret losing your heart forever. I wonder if you know how I have tried meeting other girls but I am constantly reminded of you - until I have given up on finding anyone else. I wonder if you know how I am avoiding those places which hold so much memories for us - parks like west coast park where we celebrated our first valentine day together, malls where we constantly hang out after school, restaurants we used to frequent because we love eating. I wonder if you know how much I wish I could travel back in time to our happier moments - those days at Korea University, those days when we went hunting for students deals as broke undergraduate days, those days when we went to queue for stuff like Llao Llao because you had the craving for it, those days when we travelled to Asian countries because we were poor undergraduates who cannot afford to travel further, those days when we were travelling in Europe and could finally afford those small travelling luxuries, those days when we were simply happy because we were together.

You may not be the most beautiful, smartest or nicest girl in the world. But to me, you are the most beautiful, smartest and nicest girl forever. You are the one whom I want to share my life with and grow old together with. I wished I had told you so while we were together and things would have turned out much differently. 

Princess Dinosaur, I wish that you will see this and realise that I really miss you so so so so much. I wish that you will see this and give me another chance to be a part of your life again. I wish that you will see this and know that I sincerely promise I will not squander it. I will cherish it with all my heart and soul. "
