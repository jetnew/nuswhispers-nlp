59298,"To #59298: I experienced the problem you do about society hating on ""smart"" girls. My ex used to be one of those men who believed that women should be helping men ""in the background""- we eventually broke up because he would get angry when I did better in school than him or like get on the dean's list and he did not. Even other women think like that, e.g. my grandma would tell me that if I study too hard guys won't like me. To make my ex happy I used pretend to be dumb and not answer stuff when I knew the answer, let him (and other people) explain things to me when I already get it, and hide away any prizes or good grades I got. 

But I've now found a guy who is supportive of me and I feel so much happier and comfortable in my own skin. Seeing the contrast, I now think it's better to be single and wait for someone who is supportive of you, than be attached but have to be someone you are not. Nobody should be rude and stuck up, but there is nothing wrong about being true to yourself and proud of your accomplishments. As long as you know you're not being rude to anybody or of bad character, then there's no reason to hide away your intelligence. If you want to find a guy who is supportive of your intelligence, all the more you shouldn't act dumb to attract the type of guys you are looking for!

If you don't mind acting meek or being deferential that's your choice, but just know that it doesn't have to be the only choice. People of our generation tend to be more modern, and I don't know whether this is true but I noticed that it was better with guys who studied overseas, or guys that appear 'nerdier'? Just try to expand your social circle and be patient. All the best!"
59288,"I found out that someone I knew had possibly lied about her background. Her educational background and university graduation year don't match a typical university graduate, and when I typed her particulars and date of birth into the degree verification portal, there is no match found. 

I am so thankful for the degree verification portal for exposing people like her. I just can't understand why people would lie about their achievements, which initially I was very much impressed. 
She was from a poly and managed to make it to business, before switching to science related course after her first semester and managed to finish her course within 2 years, and during her studies, she managed to work full time in ICA. (Sounds extremely impossible and fishy). When I asked about her graduation year, she replied that she had forgotten it already. Her demeanor and behaviour doesn't seem like a typical university graduate, and I am quite certain that she have lied about her background. She goes by many different names on social media, work and real life, and I am wondering which is the real her. 

Hiring managers and people who worked in HR department before, what are some of the things that you will do to verify if a candidate is lying? If she manages to answer all interview questions easily, and her educational certificates were true, would you hire her? "
59286,"Would love to start a thread here for NUS grads and how they are doing now. Maybe it’ll encourage the undergrads to look beyond grades.

NUS CNM 2016 grad here making 100k/year. CAP 3.4/5. Tag those who keep saying fass has useless degrees.. That said, I didn’t get what I’m getting now with the degree. 

Believe me when I say that the course does not prepare you for the working world, or finding a job. You have to figure out yourself the sooner the better. If you’re focusing on getting straight A, ask yourself if that’s what employers care about. Not once did any companies ask me about my grades nor course of study. So take a chill pill and enjoy your time in school. 

If you want to have a great career, go talk to people in the different companies you’re interested in and ask them what’s the best way for you to get hired. Of course you need to articulate your value beyond your grades. Talk to as many people as you can because some day they’ll need your help, and you will need theirs.

Looking forward to the sharing of alumnus from different faculties! :)"
59281,"To all the year 1 freshies at NUS,

I was once a freshie like u and i would like to share my bad experience. I was victimised by a grp of 3 females who were close frens. It was an 'innocent' group project whereby we had to do it together due to the proximity of our sitting positions during tutorial. Randomly assigned by the tutor. They actually ganged up to fail me for peer appraisal. They gave me an average of 3 points out of 10. I approached my lecturer regarding this but nothing could be done cuz it is a case of 1 against 3. My overall grade for that module dropped as a result. I could hv gotten my A or A- but ended up with a B+. Screw u bitches! I confronted them and they did apologise to me quoting that they were too harsh to give me such low appraisal marks. They also admitted that they felt I was a threat so had to do it to pull my grades down. It was a pretense that I accepted their apology and we did many projects together, scoring all A and A- for them. Years after graduation till this day, I remembered and had not forgiven them at all. 

A word of caution: Be careful of who u do project with! "
59280,"Hi so I recently started online dating and met this girl on CmB. She's really cute and fun to talk to and we've been on a few dates and chat almost everyday. However I just don't have any strong romantic feelings for her. I know movies and shows have warped my perception on ""falling in love"" or ""love at first sight"" but honestly she seems more bro material than gf material?? I may be reading it wrong but she seems to be more invested in our relationship than I am. I don't know if my feelings will change, I do like spending time with her but how and when should I tell her how I feel? Isn't it quite fked up to say like ""oh I like you, but more like a friend and not in that way yet, but I wanna hang out and keep you around cos I think there's some potential here."" I don't wanna lead her on and I also don't wanna stop hanging out with her or hurt her feelings. Also what if she makes a move first, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret cos I find it very hard to say no to people and i'm a horny MOFO. Hope I don't sound like a douche, I'd really like some advice on this. Thanks! "

59278,"Hi, I'm the OP of #59256. (Admin please don't filter this... thank you)

Rafe: Yes, we all keep on emphasising that results aren't important. But it's useless. The stress is something that she puts on herself. Not sure if she want to attend crash courses because of the costs haha... Yes, will bring her out for food and etc sometimes but most of the times, she'll give the excuse of ""I have homework to do.

To Ryan who commented under #59278: What's your point of making a comment like this? We made the choice? We chose to listen to our parents? Quit blaming others? Only know how to blame others for their situation? It's easier said than done. When you actually step into other's shoes, you will understand that it's easier than just putting the blame on 'victims'.  There may be underlying emotional and mental concerns that needs to be faced instead of just blaming people for their own actions.

59275,"I have a CS degree and I have been offered to join a tech company that specialises in outsourcing services to their offshore teams, is it advisable to join such firms? What are the career benefits I stand to gain from joining such a company? I will be working as a software engineer."
59274,"I've liked this girl for awhile already and we are quite close. Recently I asked her out but she rejected me, saying that she's now dating another guy she met online who is studying overseas in LSE. I just cant believe she would rather be in a long distance relationship, especially when we were already so close to making things work out between us! Is having an overseas degree really that more prestigious than an NUS one?"
59272,"To #59224, 
I'd like to think that's Im somewhat in the same position as you, or at least I've had some similar experiences to what you mentioned. It hurts to not quite fit in with society's expectation of the ideal girl, or the people who look for that type of person. And accordingly it's harder for people like us to find friends/romantic partners. 

Something i ask myself often (and could help you too) is what the point of ""fitting in"" is. I admit to conforming to get what i want sometimes, like playing up the shy/confused girl stereotype to get help in class, but to keep up such an act in friendships or relationships is ultimately terrifying to me. Why would i want to have friends/a partner who i can't be real with all the time? So yeah, maybe i scare people away at times and it's a bit harder to make friends (most current close friends report their first impression of me as ""intense"" or ""unfriendly"") but I just treasure the few friendships i have. 

(And it's definitely possible to find a guy who respects your intelligence, or maybe even likes you for it. Don't settle for playing a ""perfect girlfriend"" for someone just to be in a relationship because you'll eventually get unhappy anyway.) "
59271,"Apparently PGPR recently implemented a new rule stating that study /seminar rooms are to be locked from 11pm to 7am.

B often told me about the girl because the girl was really quite extreme and it was fun to gossip and hear about her. to cut story short, i found out that that girl was A and she was gossiping about me. i didnt write what exactly she said because those are details about me and to really write down what i hear it is still too painful for me to do so. but anyway that was the really the small part of what she said. i am shocked and now B is feeling sorry for me because she never expected that girl was my friend. i thought A was my friend and kept in contact without knowing anything. the worst thing was A and i even went out to eat last week. now i am so angry and sad and confused. i dont know what to do. do i need to lash out to A? should i just block her? i need to study for my CAs but i just cannot focus on anything. i just want to cry.

59255,"I've read/heard of quite a few people saying that they dislike studying and they don't like discussing academic matters. That's totally fine to me, it's a matter of personal interest. But I don't understand why academically-inclined extroverts are assumed to be arrogant and competitive. 

If I share about about what I'm reading, what I doing for my extracurriculars, and generally what I love, it isnt to brag or say I am better than other people. I'm just trying to find people with similar passions. Sometimes, I just want to share some interesting bits of knowledge, and learn more from other people.

On a semi-relevant note, and to give an example, sometimes people tell me that they find a certain module to be hard. I tend to ask ""oh ok, so why do you think that?"", especially if I have taken the same module before. And that's because I'm interested in discussing the finer points of the course. However, 9 times out of 10, they get all pressurised and stressed out by that simple question, as if I had asked them ""pls elaborate on your answer to exam question 1a"". Then they might reply to me with something like ""oh...you know, haha...it's just, like that, yknow what I mean"". I never get what that means and it boggles my mind.  "

This kind of strained the relationship between me and my sister and she was always favored and got more attention. I am really upset at why my Dad treated me this way although I did nothing wrong.

59224,"Hey admin, it’s the OP from #59224. Didn’t thought there are so many threads following smart girl post!! (Trying not to sound emotional, using 3rd person narrative below) 
Thank you all for listening to my story. The OP has been happily attached and has quite a lot of friends around her, she clicks well with those who shares the same passion or those she admires. To answer some of your questions, she is taking care of her appearance well as she was in charge of CCA fashion design department back in old school. 
However, she feels that sometimes there are definitely drawbacks for being unique, like many people can feel connection with you, but you can only connect with so few. She can speak a few languages, but it is very difficult for people to get a full picture of what she is thinking. She’s never a member of a girl clique either, due to skewed boy to girl ratio in her course and she’s more or less raised up like a guy, interested in history and maths. That fail in connection and constant losing interest in things other people like led her to negative thoughts and she was once keen to read through lots of  psychology books to find what was wrong with her mind. The reason why she said she could not be popular is that she could not keep small talks going.
She’s not perceived as the hardworking type either, but that is exactly what she was talking about. She’s seen girls who asked for help and attention given more credits than those who worked hard and chasing their own dreams, where hardworking and competency are definitely redeeming qualities!! She thinks it is a social phenomenon here (Asia in general) and wants to call out. As she admires smart and attractive females depicted in foreign literatures (Irene Adler for example) and she thinks competent females more widely accepted overseas. 
She just doesn’t want to be alone ."

I ever thought of confessing to him. But I know the answer is he will reject me. Last year, I found out that he broke up with his gf. And I decided to drop him an instagram message. To my horror, he replied. We started chatting abit but I was the one that initiated the conversation all along. I know he wouldn’t like me because I look ugly and fat. I even asked him if a good personality is better than figures. But he told me that he prefers personality over figure. Subsequently when I confessed to him, he rejected me and I was like wtf? I immediately unfriend him, I blocked him in insta, fb, whatsapp, telegram. As long as he has an account in any app, I will block him. I just can’t believe what he said become the opposite.

So yesterday she came to my hostel and told me she want to accept me for who I am. I was elated and hopeful and went to the pantry to heat up some pizza to share with her. To my horror when I return back to my room I caught her deleting my hamster butt pictures. She even deleted my hidden folder of cat butt pictures... I slam the pizza on the floor and yelled at her.. she ran out crying and we haven't talked for almost a day and it felt like eternity.

I am lost and confused. Should I give up on my hobby or this relationship? I know she wants me to be a ""normal"" person but I don't know man. I feel miserable af now"
59215,"I have a female friend, we’ve known each other for quite a while now but never really gotten closer until recent years. Since then we’ve been hanging out more often, going for lunch, studying together etc. I know she is attached but I can’t help but to have feelings for her. And what makes it worse is she’s been telling me about her rs problems and how unstable their rs is getting and it gets my hopes up. I know it’s damn toxic to have these thoughts but what can I do? ): "
59213,"Hi, I'm looking for any kind data science student who is willing to share his/her experience as a data science student from NUS. 

I am an NUS student from FASS, but someone (not local) from my former International school reached out to me as she is interested in doing data science in NUS, and wants to know more from a student. I can't help her, but I hope that some kind soul is willing to help! If you can, please comment and I'll direct her to you. 

Thank you so much! :)"
59211,"Is it reasonable for parents to order their children around? 

Last night, I told my parents that I’d be going for blood donation the next day, then mum demanded that I would not go for my appointment because I donate too often. Fact-check, last donation was 3 months ago. I resisted and insisted and explained that her reasons are ungrounded and purely based on feelings. Dad took her side. Things got out of hand because we’re all quick to anger... let’s just say there was shouting and hitting involved (they hit me). In my anger, I did say I will call the police but that only aggravated them, and I didn’t really mean it.

I know this is a petty thing to fight over. After calming down, I went to talk to them and explained to them it wasn’t that I am set on donating blood per se, it’s that I want to retain my autonomy over my own life, make my own decisions and walk my own path. To give some context, I am turning 21 soon. We established that things could’ve been handled better on both our ends. Me, the tone and expression; them, their quickness to react with anger. We also established that I could’ve overreacted when I sense my freedom being “threatened”. I know they had my health in mind, so I took a step back and rescheduled my appointment for another three months later (they think I should only donate twice a year at the maximum).

However, this morning, mum came up and said it was perfectly reasonable and normal for parents to give orders their children. She got angry again when I disagreed and said that I think that is untrue and unreasonable. 

There seems to be a big clash between my parents and I due to the difference in our world views and beliefs. I can never express my thoughts and opinions without meeting anger because anything misaligned with their narrow set of  their beliefs is not tolerated. They perceive it as disobedience rather than a discussion. I’m not getting the respect I think I deserve. I feel unheard and misunderstood.

What should I do to maintain the harmony in my family without entirely compromising on my own beliefs? Thoughts and advice would be much appreciated."
59210,"I was in charge of buying some resources for my class. As is common, the packaging may be slightly dented or damaged when we buy stuff. I kept the nicest packaging wrapping for the guy I had a thing for, while the guy who was anti-social and awkward received the ugliest packaging. Was I even right to insert my judgement in this situation? I feel bad for the anti-social guy who might have indirectly felt that he received the worst of the lot, as represented by the packaging. But I will still definitely keep the nicest item for the guy I like since I happen to be in charge of buying the class items. Any thoughts. They are all the same items, but is the packaging significant in representing anything?"

59206,"To #59206 and all those who hookups when you're on exchange in Europe:

Out of curiosity, how can u guys/ladies get hookup when you're in Europe with Asian face and height?

I have done an exchange in Europe, and my general impression is 

1. European girls have no problem to meet new Asian guys, to have small chat...
   (I got 'much busier' Tinder in Europe than in Sg)

2. but when it comes to deeper relationship topic, or sexual/hookup topic, European women tend to be more conservative on non-european and less likely open the opportunity to Asian guy. They also prefer to stick with people from their own country (so this trend is NOT just for PRC!)

So for those who have been in a relationship/ hookup with European/Caucasian/American, what do you (man/woman) think?

59205,"My boyfriend doesn't want to help to pay for my birth control pills... I'm not even asking him to pay the whole price, just half? Is that not reasonable? Other couples, do you split the cost of birth control (whether condoms, pills or others)?"
59200,"Some claim that pure friendship, and even the best friendship, can happen between a male and a female. I befriended a guy recently. Initially, it felt more excited than a female friend, but after a while, it started to feel bored. We don't really share the same frequency, plus he doesn't understand me as good as a female friend, so he often misses my point :("
