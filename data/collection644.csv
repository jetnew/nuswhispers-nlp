64499,Is it advisable to tell your employer that you are currently doing a part time masters? Im worried that I may be signaling to my boss that I may not stay here for long term or may switch jobs to another company. Any part timers or managers can share some insights on this? Maybe Prof Ben?
64496,"I met my boyfriend in NUS and wanted to share this. Things were great in school and like any other lovey-dovey couple, we spent most of our time together. He was very tolerant of my tantrums, give in to me and would always respond to my call almost immediately. Sometimes I felt he loved me more than I do. However, as we graduated and started working, I begin to neglect him and thought that the small things he did for me were a little annoying. Soon, we drifted apart and broke up. That was when I realised that I have made a big mistake. There is no one else that understood me more than him and I wish time would turn back. To all NUS couples out there, never take your partner for granted as you will never know when they might turn away."

64488,"My girlfriend used to be a simple down to earth girl who was happy with small little things in life. However, ever since she started an internship a year ago, she started buying branded expensive clothing and bags and started to dress herself up. Each clothing can cost up to $300 which is overpriced. After her internship ended, she continued her spending habits and even sometimes asked me for money to buy those clothes. Whenever I asked her to stop spending so much, she would get angry and defensive. I feel that she has symptoms of princess syndrome and she’s becoming less of the girl I’ve signed up for. I think it may get worse when she starts full time work. Should I just break off the relationship?"
64487,"I wish I could be happy for my family, but I just couldn't get rid of the resentment that I have for all of them. My brother went overseas for studies and settled down there, without having to give a hoot about the issues at home. 
My dad (divorced) gets along well with his girlfriend and she takes good care of him. However, while both of them were happily going on with their lives, I constantly have to worry about how to handle the financial and health issues from my mum as she's currently struggling alone and constantly bugging me to take care of her in the future. Even during family gatherings, they can just excuse themselves and let me go alone to answer for them.
Over the years, I became a workaholic in order to pay off my mum's debts.I found myself not smiling anymore and getting emotionally detached from all my family members. When they ask why I am so cold towards them, I don't know how to answer them anymore. I guess there's no point to having a family when all of them are just looking after their self interests"

64478,"If a man is not experienced in relationships or in interpersonal dynamics... if he was more or less a social outcast (ie. not that experienced with women/sex/relationships or ""socializing"") - if that man did manage to acquire a girl friend... how would he deal with everything that comes with that? Compromises? Expectations? Obligations? All the little social/interpersonal nuances between men & women that he may not even be consciously aware of? For most people it seems social nuance and all the above is as second nature as breathing is. They learn via years & years of interaction with peers, women etc... For an FA he's starting from point zero. What worsens the issue is that a normie would not even be able to articulate exactly what those nuances are, it's just subconscious instinct by now."
64476,"Hi #64476, OP of #64464 here. To me, I feel that the biggest issue about ""military culture"" is the mindset, less so about the material side of things. I agree with those who said that we deserve the shoes, t-shirts, shorts etc. that we earn from our 2 years of service. I myself do wear them occasionally (not necessarily to school).

Maybe I didn't go into enough details in my previous post about what I meant about ""army culture"". I think for me, one of the more specific examples of ""army culture"" that stood out was when the project director of the event (which I shall not name here) shouted ""ten, nine, eight, ..., three, two, one"" He was trying to get us to get to where we should be for that activity within the time limit. Of course he did display other signs of ""military leadership"", but there are just too many to name here.

Anyway, I really want to give a big thanks for all of you guys who replied with advice (and the jokes), it helped a lot :D"
64475,"So I finally texted a girl who's been my classmate for the past few semesters and has done a few projects with me and well, it wasn't exactly clear if I really liked her or anything, but I definitely felt like she and I were pretty close friends. And because it's important to clarify in 2019, yes I am a straight guy, and as far as I know, she is a straight girl. 

So we watched a movie; we have pretty similar movie tastes. But the current movies are just horrible. The new MIB has overused jokes, even if the guy is somewhat more stupid than normal (it is rather refreshing to see Thor being stupid) but the plot was weak and overall the chemistry was not fantastic. 

After the movie we discussed it over a nice dinner at Astons - nothing too fancy since we were just going out as friends. But one thing led to another and of course the question was asked. 

""Wait, isn't this kind of like a date?""

I tried to play it cool but it was probably wrong because when I replied ""well yea it is kind of like the 14th of June"" she got mad and stopped talking to me. She usually did not mind such jokes so I was very shocked. I asked her what was wrong and she just glared at me. We ate quietly for the rest of the dinner and afterwards I asked if she just wanted to chill and grab desserts. She simply rolled her eyes and nodded. I thought this was a good sign. 

Bought some ice cream to share and we still had our cold war. Yup, we fought over who would get more chocolate and who would get more matcha. Is matcha really a thing with girls because I like it a lot but not THAT much. So then she asked me something pretty similar, but probably more subtle so that I would not be able to reply in such an infuriating manner. 

""So, why did you ask me out alone?""

I really wanted to reply with a joke since that's what I would proably do, but that chocolate ice cream had an effect on me. The brain freeze probably made it impossible to think of a good joke. I told her that she's a close friend and honestly we were very alike and I appreciated that. Perhaps its a good time to say we were both wearing a white top with denim jeans. So of course I had to tell her we were a matcha made in heaven. And of course...

she smiled. I bet you guys didn't see that one coming. So everything turned out well and we said goodbye. We promised to meet each other again another time. Don't really understand why my replies worked sometimes and why they don't on other times... is it the quality? the timing?"
64473,"To seniors that are working part time during school, what are some good long term part time jobs for university students?

64472,"I fell for this guy from electrical engineering within a very short period of time. With him, it just felt so right. I felt so secure and protected with him but I think only see me as a friend.

I don’t want my feelings to ruin the friendship because im really afraid that he might not feel the same way.

64471,"How do you get someone to stop messaging you? TO BE CLEAR I've already told this guy directly to stop messaging me. He was in my tutorial last sem and will occasionally message me, reply to my insta stories, etc. and the messages are all trying to hint for something between us. I am not close with this guy and only shared my hp. no. because of whatsapp group. And insta because when everyone was sharing, they asked for mine and i felt obliged to tell him (because everyone was exchanging and making friends). We share a same circle of friends who don't know that he's been messaging me. I don't want to tell them because I don't want to start drama, I just wish he'd stop texting me. I don't want to resort to blocking / unfollowing them on insta because we're in whatsapp group chat too. I fear that I may lose my friends because I'm just distancing myself from them even though I don't want to. How?

For the sake of other girls & guys, if any of you reading this has been spamming someone even after they've told you to stop, just STOP. If they're throwing mixed signals then I can't help you mate :("

64468,"My family has been pressurizing me to get into a relationship. Accordingly to them, school is the best (and final) place to find a good quality girlfriend. As we age and go working, it is much harder to find your other half. If a relationship fails while you are still a student, you still have time to look for other partners. But I don't think that way. I am an introvert who values my own personal time and freedom too much. I'm also spending a lot of time juggling studies and developing my personal hobbies into side gigs. How can I tell my family that I'm not interested in a relationship and stop pestering me?"
64467,Why are there more and more people who want to get into a relationship just because they don't want to be single? You're supposed to wait til you meet your other half.  A relationship will turn out well only if you truly love your partner for who they are.

You may think that you are responsible over lots of stuff and is indispensable to the team.

But in actual fact, you are nothing more than just a little cog in the machine. If you die, you will just be replaced by someone else.

Never show that you know lots of things that are beyond your scope of responsibility and be unconditionally helpful to others. The more you do them, the more people deem you to be someone they can exploit."

64454,"Those who were very active in student clubs and activities during your undergrad years, how do you mentally prepare yourself to transition to a more mundane and less exciting adult working life?

Since my first year, I've been someone very actively involved in student activities (Camps, Rag, Student Life Fair, Open Day, you name it). I stayed in Hall too so I had a lot of involvement and made many close friends from there.

Thankfully I managed my time well so I still did decently for my studies and already secured a job at Jurong Island. Having said that, I also know that working life will probably never be as vibrant and relaxed as student life. My work will mostly be operational type at a petrochemical firm so the daily and weekly routine would be pretty standard throughout the year I guess.

How do you stay positive and motivated without feeling jaded with work life and always keep reminiscing about your undergrad years? At least when we were studying, we had the Dec and summer holidays to look forward to, something like an end goal and a break after studying so hard in the semester. But once we start working, there's practically no end to the grind till you retire. How do you keep yourself going apart from looking forward to the paycheck?

I know some ppl are gonna say ""Grow the hell up"", and I understand but, that's not sth you can do overnight is it? So I just wanna know how those already working but had a similar student life as me back in their undergrad years managed to do the transition."

Very few people have a clue that I did some of the research and groundwork. And they like to pass their miscellaneous work for me to solve.

I met her at a party hosted by her cousin, also a friend of mine, weeks ago. Mingled around and realised her charming smile and bubbly personality accentuated her good looks despite the crowd.

She began teasing me of my age and even lied to me in a joking manner whenever I wanted to know more about her, but clarified the next time i dmed her. We discussed about bgr/ her ideal type and she mentioned that she’d rather let things happen naturally and joked if i had anyone to intro. Reason why i ain’t sure she likes me is bc she doesn’t initiate convo/texts even if she always replies real quick. Asked my friend about her but she says it’s her usual and she may just be treating me as an older brother. I’m in a dilemma. Should I let her know about my attraction or just continue being friends and see how things progress?"
64448,"OP of #64396 here.
Thank you all for the kind comments, lovely people we have here.

I know a lot of you were saying that if she was a true friend she would have kept it to herself and probably bring it to her grave instead of putting me in such a position. Well for 1, I would have done the exact same thing if I were in her shoes - and I think most people would as well (just like the countless confessions here who die die must confess to the guy/girl regardless, because we don't want to live with the regret of not saying how we truly felt). 
And when she told me about how she felt, she said (paraphrased): ""I just wanted to get it off my chest, I know saying all these now wouldn't change a thing because of how committed a person you are and I'm not asking you to leave her nor am I expecting anything in return, I just wanted a form of closure on my end, to tell you and know that we're impossible."" She was right about the commitment part, I'm never the kind to waver. But idk why when it comes to this close friend of mine... ok fine I do know why. 

To those that say it is supposed to be easy just cut ties and choose your partner, I really hope you never ever find yourselves in such a position. And to those that asked who do I love or who do I want to spend the rest of my life with, honestly I can't choose because I'd be equally happy and contented with either (oh and to the one asking which is prettier, it's the close friend but I'm not going to be swayed by that) 

Anyway, doubt anything drastic will happen, I'm not going to leave my partner for her because if she knew, she will be guilt ridden for the rest of her life thinking she broke us up. But what I'm going to do is to tell my partner about this because I don't want to be guilty about hiding things.

Oh side note, partner doesn't know that close friend and I had a thing in the past, I mean technically we didn't get attached so I mean you don't tell your partner about all the 'could have beens' right. So when she first met this friend she did always wondered and asked me why I never chased her or why we never got together because we were such a great fit, she pretty, knows you well, got chemistry etc. But at that point of time we had alr moved on (she had a partner too then) so we just said like we were platonic af.
So with this, do I still tell my partner everything?? I mean sometimes part of maintaining a relationship is that you keep certain things to yourself right. Yeah need help here with the filtering.

Tldr; uh just read everything, and read the previous one too if you didnt"
64445,"Hey #64268, let me share how I returned a similar favour in a mix of entertainment value and monetary value. 

A friend once transferred a month of fitness class subscription to me which I have wanted to try but unable to afford then. I have intention to return this big favour to him too. I know he would not accept actual price payment* or some friendship price so I decided to do it in a jokingly way. I took photos of me in stupid funny pose during each workout such as flexing my mini muscle, showing my butt, showing my fat tummy. At the end of the month, I thanked him for letting me try out those fitness routines and offered to buy him a lunch for that while sending those photos inbetween the conversation haha. Seeing those photos made him cursed me out, but in a friendly manner and we both had a good laugh over it. The lunch treat happened and concluded with the food choice to his liking, pricing to my comfort and us TCSS over the lunch. We both considered the favour has been returned in our heart.

You pointed out receiving 70/100 dollars meal plan as a big favour, maybe you are having financial difficulties just like me then and there is a possibility that your friend might see the 70/100 dollars lunch treat as a burden to your financial situation instead, thus refused it. Don't worry about that and don't think so much since you have now decided to go ahead with the drink treats to return the favour. Spend your brain cells on the drink sessions and do your best making her feel happy during each session. To me, a 70/100 cents cup of kopi with friends and smiles along the way tastes much better than an expensive cup of kopi without a moment of joy. Perhaps you can also rate the top 3 of the 14 meals you received and bring her to eat there. I believe the individual meal pricing should be within the comfort level of your and her for a lunch treat.

May you have a long lasting friendship with her! Happy weekend! 

* If this is the payback option, I have no money to pay up too. haha

P.S. Both are males in my story, but not a gay story with the photo part ya!"

We do not have any form of financial support and are struggling to pay off, even with bursary. To be frank, $80 may seem little for some, but it can translate to 16 meals for us (assuming $5 per meal) or a full day of work. However, if we were to miss out camps, we lose the opportunities to make friends and potentially be left out from existing cliques.

Today when I was eating dinner with my friends we made eye contact for a moment but I guess that's nothing much out of the ordinary. Not sure why he was there since it was so late but well.

A respectful individual that I am, I wished the bird a good day and very politely tried to walk away. But rudely ignoring my courteous gestures, it hobbled forward and overtook me, and sat squarely in the middle of the road, blocking my way once again. Somewhat affronted, and certainly not disposed to be outdone by a mere pigeon, I redoubled my pace, but the audacious vermin did the exact same thing, keeping ahead of me at a safe distance, and looking at me sideways with that infuriatingly dumb face of their kind. Hungry and sweating in the noonday heat, I nevertheless persevered in chasing it all the way from E.R.C. to CREATE, at which point the ignominious little devil finally took pity on me and took wing, leaving me on the ground to bite its dust . After that emasculating and dehumanizing experience, I sheepishly returned back to my room to lick my wounds, and to pen this angry piece.
