60397,"I wish the BT profs were more like prof Ben. The CS profs on NUSWhispers are so responsive, whereas for BT2102, the schedule says we were supposed to have an assignment in week 6 and one in week 7, but they still haven't been released. It'll just be a repeat of IS1103 from last sem.

Girl here. i was discussing group project with another female friend and i sent a pic of our group project details from my com screen not realizing the tabs of the PORN TITLES i was watching just now was VISIBLE in the pic. it was an accident. thankfully whatsapp has the ""delete for everyone"" function before it got blue ticked. but i am feeling extremely paranoid right now that her iphone could have saved the whatsapp pic automatically for her or appeared on her lock screen. need advice on how to stop panicking and worrying. she's a close uni friend but she's also a very conservative, religious good girl. how do i even face or talk to her in future?? i feel really anxious about this and she's also a project mate. HELP!!!!!"
60395,"I'm not academically coping well, right, and pretty much everyone in my major knows how badly I've been lagging behind. This is particularly so in the area of public speaking, which I've always had a phobia of because of lack of self confidence + slow-thinking.  

Recently I've had someone I considered relatively close (and who had always been really nice to me) tell me things like how ""you (I) should stop trying because you suck at everything"" and ""I look forward to seeing your oral presentation, because it would be hilarious watching the instructor break you down to pieces"". 

I've never said anything so far, because I've always tried to be diplomatic and patient with other people, but I can't help but feel like this bastard has gone too far. How ridiculously disgusting and pathetic it must be for someone to derive such perverse joy from another's suffering. Such schadenfreude indeed. 

 I'm going to continue trying regardless of what this person says. I can't give myself the option to be afraid or fail anymore. 

And hopefully one day, I'll be good enough to beat scum like that into the dirt.  "

""Why he never talk one."" 

HUH? Who are you? Are you my friend? What you want me to say? Why do you need to know what am I thinking? Do I have an obligation to make noise and talk to a bunch of hi-bye acquaintances?

She said “I expect my future bf to treat me like a princess. I May have the money and capabilities to survive myself but I will expect the guy to take care of my needs. If my bf doesn’t do that for me then I need a bf for what? Might as well stay single”

60380,"#60336 your confession just shows how self-entitled you are, Strawberry Generation. Please look at the statistics; for the undergraduate intake in 2018/2019, there are 2147 students in School of Computing while there are 5421 students in Faculty of Engineering, which is slightly more than double of SoC’s. The Research Graduates in SoC has been counted as 283 while there are 1095 Research Graduates in FoE. (coursework graduates are excluded here because they share the same lecture/tutorial space as undergraduates). This is a whopping four times more! Additionally, SoC provide 5 courses while FoE has 10 courses.

FoE also has to allocate a lot of space for laboratories for all 10 departments, because most of them require huge equipment and most of the Research Graduates take up a lot of space and resource for their testing (in order to write their thesis). This is oppose to SoC’s “laboratory” work, which basically takes place in computer labs. FoE also has a canteen, which is shared with SDE, while SoC doesn’t even have one! There are also some external-linked research space that are within FoE (e.g. T-labs) which FoE students don’t use.

Given that there is COM1, COM2 and an upcoming COM3, AND SoC also uses i3, AS3 and AS6, I’m failing to see how NUS is not “prioritising” in giving SoC more space, especially when there is limited land to expand. And no matter how much SoC’s intake has increased, statistics has shown that it is still a relatively small Faculty.

Lastly, you’re a student at NUS. Can’t you at least do some research before making comments irresponsibly?!"
60379,"#60379: Hey there, just randomly dropping by...

I cannot really help you with that, I would recommend to feedback to the bus operators to ask them to request making more handlebars to help provide more support. 

I do believe that it is a matter of the suspension, as well as how your drivers drive, along with the winding terrain you have around, which results in you rolling about. Just look up the underneath of the bus. They're supported by balloons or something, when cars are typically supported by springs.


Though, I'd say this: your handlebars are made of this:

OD 32 x 1.6 mm SS Tubes (looks and sounds like SS 304), with a centreline radius of around R = 127mm.

The process is draw-bending for the one at the front, and roll-bending for the ones you hold onto in the middle of the bus. 

You can sort of tell from measuring them. A quick google search, a vernier caliper and a few more tools could get that for you.

Now, if anyone wants to effect a change, you have the information. I believe my peers are more than ready to do a relatively profitable ( around a few hundred bucks?) mini project on this, while I work on my FYP..."
60376,"To #60376: I had a similar experience too with one of the UHC psychiatrists during the pre-uni mental health assessment, but can't remember who it was :/ I remember feeling quite shocked by the way she was speaking to me, because aren't psychiatrists supposed to be empathetic, or at the very least fake it? I forgot about it eventually until now because I thought I was just being delusional, but maybe I was wrong. Throughout the whole assessment it felt like she had this unfeigned disgust towards me, like I was wasting her time for being there. For context I already have difficulty talking to counsellors or therapists but when she was asking stuff like ""so what trauma happen to you"" ""why do you have depression"" in this contemptuous way I got even more withdrawn, and  I felt guilty because she was obviously frustrated with me. I know psychiatrists aren't supposed to do a therapist's job and talk through everything but it was such a stark contrast to the psychiatrists I've been with in the hospital. It was so bad to the point that at the end when she asked me to decide whether to transfer from the hospital to UHC for treatment with her it was a straight-up no from me even though going to the UHC would be free and I already have trouble affording to go to the hospital. Maybe if more come forward, something might be done."

60374,"I took cs2040 last sem under Prof Harold and it was the toughest module I've ever taken but also one of the most enjoyable. I'm a strong coder but completely new to DS&A, so it was a steep learning curve throughout. Spent almost every day on hackerrank/leetcode to practice (tip to current/future students: it really works, I got a grade I'm very happy with). 

But I really enjoyed the course throughout, esp lectures and tutorials :) Posting this now because I happened to stumble on another cs2040 post about Prof Harold, and I wanted to express my gratitude to him too. What I learned still regularly comes into use when I'm doing online coding tests, or technical interviews. 10/10 would suffer through it again.

60369,"its 2019 and i still don't understand lectures that don't provide webcast - especially when they have the logistics and equipment to do so - especially when the notes are bad and the lecturer is bad too.

people can't catch the point when the lecturer rambles on and on without getting to the main point and there is no webcast to refer to again after the lecture.

Whats the point if a lecturer insists on no webcasts because of their principles or old school ways of teaching/learning, but people start recording the lectures with their own devices anyway?

in that sense, people like me who don't have the means to record the lecture lose out, isn't it?

Its so hard to catch up when i miss something important said in the lecture when the notes are insufficient and there is no webcast, and the goddamn cohort is so competitive and everyone is so apprehensive to sharing their knowledge.

university is so frustrating, the inefficient learning system and counterproductive environment by over-competitiveness.

Also many of his family members tend to fall sick often, including himself. Many of his elders have one chronic illness or another.
