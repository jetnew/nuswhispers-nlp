would it be selfish of me to stop talking to him, seeing how i doubt i have a shot with him anyway? he thinks of me as a friend but the feeling of unrequited affection makes me extremely upset and i'd rather just move on with my life than to continue being kept in this grey area."
55895,"Hi, I’ve been reading the interesting (although sometimes overly emotional) posts on NUSWhispers. Here are my thoughts: 
Generalist degrees (e.g FASS) teach a wide range of knowhow. The students may be less prepared for their first job compared to their peers, but they have better progression (late game). They should probably equip some technical skills (e.g excel, basic programming) to help with their early game. 
For Specialist degrees (e.g Comp Science), the students are well prepared for their first jobs (early game), but they will probably find themselves unemployed in 3 years IF they stop learning. They must keep the momentum going and keep learning new stuff. 
Regarding the survey showing that SUTD and SMU students have a higher mean starting salary compared to NUS students: 
Firstly, the subjects often have different names, but when we do a comparison between similar subjects (e.g SMU and NUS computer science), we can see that the NUS graduates generally fair better. Taking the mean across all subjects (including the ‘late game’ generalist degrees) naturally gives the result in the survey. 
Nevertheless, I think there is a lot that we can learn from SUTD and SMU. Considering their admission cutoffs together with their starting salaries, I think that there is a lot of value-adding from these Unis. 
In particular, I think the industry focused approach that they adopt is very beneficial. When a university is industry focused, the students can learn how to solve the current challenges faced by the industry. The university’s research will also  benefit by becoming more relevant.
What I often see in NUS is the CAP focused approach. Quite often, students internalize the content taught without learning about its practical use. And sometimes, content is taught without thinking about whether it has practical use. My suggestion is to couple the theoretical content taught in modules with their applications in industry. I see some profs and TAs from SOC in the comments sometimes, I am interested to see what you guys think too. (Sorry that my writing is not very rigorous. It’s because I am typing this at 3am. I hope you guys get the idea) "
55893,"Hi i hope everybody is enjoying your post-final holidays! I am actually in a bit of a dilemma but I find it hard to describe my problem so I hope you can really help me. I am born as a boy, i.e. to say i am a male biologically. However, i feel a bit feminine and more comfortable seeing myself as a girl even though i do not have much female interactions, coming from a boys school for 10 years and being in mechanical engineering in NUS. The reason I am asking is because right now I am in BKK and I decided and have already done a sex change operation. I am not due to return until a week later, so I need your advice on how do i break this news to my family and friends on my recent developments. I admit it is a rash decision as I did not consult anybody about it. But yet i feel good about myself for taking this leap of faith and I have no regrets about it at all. Still i think it is unfair that my family and friends have no knowledge of this in any sense and they deserve to know. Even if i dont tell them, i am pretty sure they can see the difference anyway. So please, give me some advice, they are really much appreciated. Thank you so much really grateful for your efforts. "

55888,"Let's admit it. - ""If you are the tze char boss, will you employ the chef or the dishwasher?""

This is a cruel world. Only the survivor of the fittest will gain. If you are in a stage of life to decide whether your career route will be technical or not, my advice is choose the technical route. Oh wait, I am using the word ""IF"", ""IF, ""IF. Please don't come and tell me that I am categorizing and having a conclusion that the world is black and white, all or nothing. It is a conditional clause and I'm not implying on any ""conclusive thoughts that you are referring to"". 

Yes, this is the world and the world is unfair. If you do not run fast enough, others will overtake you easily. If you do not choose a technical route, others will. For example, Tom graduate from a Bachelor of Cooking and Harry graduate from a Bachelor of Dish-washing. Both went to apply the job. Sadly, there is only 1 open vacancy. So the question is who will get hire in the end? 

During the interview...

Tom say : ""I can cook"". 
Harry say : ""I can wash the dish"".
Tom say : ""I can cook and wash the dish""

In the end, Tom get hire because he can do both. Let's say in times of good economy, the Tze char boss, Dick, is in a happy mood and hire both of them.  Harry, on the other hand, aware of his disadvantage position he is in and impress his Dick by being the most hardworking dish-washer in the stall. One day, the economy trend changes from Tze char to lok lok. Customers  drop and Dick need to cut workers. Who will be the first to go? Of course is harry even if he is the most hardworking person in the stall. Why will the most hardworking person force to leave? What logic is this? As I said, this is the world and the world does not pity you. Only technical prevails. In order for business to grow, Dick being a dick need the chef to sustain his business but not harry. If not who cook? you cook ah? Then who can wash the dish? Of course is Tom la... 

So what if Harry tries all his life to be the best he can do, being the best dish washer in the world? It does not work at all. It all goes deep down on whether you have the value and skills to the business or not and not to always dream at the optimistic side that ""Okie..keep cool, i will just be the best i can do and then something will drop from the sky and save me"". 

Eventually, Dick convert his Tze char to lok lok style, following the trend of the economy. Customers swarm his stall and business is on its peak again. He intended to hire 1 additional person to fill up Harry job again - Wash dish !!! One day, 5 graduates from Bachelor of Cooking comes to apply for this job. Thus, there is a surplus of available technical-skilled person to be able to fulfill this job. Then, harry heard the news and went to apply for this job again. Dick saw harry and did not hire him eventually but just pick out the best from the 5 graduates. Why harry did not get hire again even if he always try to be the best dishwasher in the world? Because Dick need someone to cover Tom if he is on MC or if one day Tom intend to leave the lok lok stall. 

Choosing a route for your career is important. Don't worry on passion first. Passion can be build at later stage. Even if no passion, it does not matter. At least you will not be stress about lack of money in future. Of course, earn it fast, earn it well and retire early. And remember to buy insurance early to protect your assets in future. 

People always tell me ""Aiya, you earn so much money, later one day you suddenly die how?"" Then, i will ask them back ""What if I have this mentally of you and just spent and be happy everyday and eventually i did not die suddenly how? Then i need to start to earn back all my money at an older age again?""

55884,Hello! Has anyone taken GES1017? May I ask if the workload is heavy? Thank you. 
55883,"To #55865: Guys usually overstate their number of previous sexual partners... just saying. But on the off chance that it's accurate - I mean you can tell in bed, honestly. Personally my ex and I broke up on personal differences, so I can't say I empathise much. But he's had a few previous partners as well... I'm pretty sure more than 8, and he was exceptionally good, which makes it all the more awkward when I bump into him at techno. Well here's to more years of bumping into him at E2 café...

But from a more serious perspective, I think maybe people should carefully weigh the pros and cons about breakup before actually considering it. Finding someone who gets you is not easy, and oftentimes even if they say there are plenty more fish in the sea, even when you catch another fish, you end up comparing it to the one that got away. And the one that got away will always be bigger because you're looking at it through rose tinted glasses.

So the saying should be there are plenty more fish in the sea, so don't stop till you catch a sea king. (Yes, I read One-Piece, don't judge, it's not only a guy thing). If your friend thinks that she's found the one, then this small issue isn't going to bother her that much. Maybe it's something else that's bothering her, and this sudden revelation has just made it worse.

Well all the best I guess, these things are always rather thorny to deal with. But mind you, getting dumped hurts like a bitch, so be careful about bringing it up."
55882,"#55865 Hi, sorry, to be honest, your friend should ask herself if she's content with this guy. I don't see an issue with having multiple previous partners, especially since he's at least decent enough to not talk (read: brag) about them, and to be fair, your friend didn't ask.

I've seen people who can't shut up about their previous partners, whether they talk about bedroom antics or just generally stories about their exes to their current bf/gf, and I think that's just massively disrespectful unless they've clearly stated that they want to know. Disclaimer here, I've seen someone who's used the fact that a project acronym was the same 3 letters as the start of her ex bf's name to launch into a long rant about her ex, and I think that's completely unreasonable and totally selfish.

I think it's important for people generally to adopt a don't ask don't tell kind of situation, unless you're sure you can handle it, and unless there's really something important to raise like an STI or a previous pregnancy I guess. In this case clearly your friend can't handle it, and I'd advise her to go talk to him about it calmly, because there's no sense in ruining something that's good now over something that's fucked up in the past.

I guess I can see why she'd be concerned, probably thinking along the lines that she's not ""unique"" or that there's nothing ""special"" about this relationship to him rather than all the others, but I think at the end of the day, special is what you make it. The difference is simply that the rest are in the past, and one day they'll be forgotten. If he's serious about this one, why not?

Anyway, this is for them to decide. I can only advise them to talk about it, and honestly, if she's otherwise happy and this is something she thinks she can get over in the long run, why ruin it now?

I mean, good guys and good sex are hard to find, girl. Don't ruin it on a whim, and don't end it without talking about it first."

55875,"Regarding the debacle over the sexual history of romantic partners here, I would like to point out that this may be the result of a hyper–sanitized and purist mindset over sex that had been encouraged and perhaps indoctrinated in us at youth. I do not blame my parents, as every parent would want to protect their child and their innocence. However, as an Asian that grew up in Europe, I have got to experience on one end, a more liberal, sex-positive society and on another end a more Asian, conservative one dominated by Abrahamic faiths (here).

What I would like to suggest is that by oversanitizing the topic of sex, giving it too strong a cringe-factor and associating it with disgust, virginity suddenly becomes an excessively important factor for relationships. This seems to be part of mainstream culture here and I accept that.

Whilst I applaud the pragmatism of our society, I believe that perhaps this puritanical ideation of love, sex and marriage could be a contributing factor to the declining birth rate. By over–sanitising sex in our culture, this prohibits an honest and reasonable intergenerational dialogue (for instance between parent and child, teacher and student) and also halts any form of sexual deviance and exploration. In so doing, we have successfully steered ourselves away from a society that can achieve reproductive success (healthy TFR).

What I suggest is that key stakeholders continue to expand the image of open–arms, open–ears positivity to the sex education system, not just the current areas already covered by the public health agenda (I see promise in the cheesy adverts on diabetes), as I believe this would benefit the youth of today and tomorrow."
55874,"In response to post #55864 and really the whole debate going on about FASS...

I'm not a FASS student but I have to say it is naive to think that technical degrees like law, medicine, pharmacy, architecture are safe degrees in this day and age. There is a glut of lawyers out there in the market (this is not gonna clear out anytime soon) and with the rise of AI and other technologies, there will be even lesser need for lawyers in future. In medicine, doctors are generally in a good place but many professional medical jobs will also be replaced with robots and AI. Pharmacy, there won't be a need for pharmacist at the pharmacy, and for those working in hospitals or research, you career is rather stagnant without an advanced degree. Bankers are already losing jobs due to technology and market conditions, and this will only get worst in future. Architects are generally in a good place since you can't substitute creativity, but again not many architects make it to the top because there will always be those few people that stands out from the rest and you either move on to management roles or be stuck with the menial work at the bottom. 

The value of a degree is as much as the value of a person, what can you bring to the table that is different from everyone else? There are many lawyers, doctors, pharmacist, architects and etc that have moved on from their traditional professional roles,  why? They find better value/purpose elsewhere. The point I'm trying to say is this, every profession out there is at risk of being substituted or replaced by technology or market factors, how you'll survive is really dependent on your ability to learn and adapt to the work environment that you are put in. There are safer degrees but there are no safe jobs. And your wealth can come in many ways and not just from your profession, you'll just got to figure out what works best for you. A FASS grad will fill up roles that are necessary in the labor market, and they are vital for a country to function. Hack, some of them will make more than you ever will and you coming from some technical degree is just giving you the illusion of job stability or even wealth. Peace. "
55872,"#55860 If it were me, I would rather avoid open conflicts with my FYP prof. Contact his PhD students, see if they can help. They may have projects that interest you."
55871,"With regards to the late class division talks. I have many messy ideas surrounding this issue. Let me just spam some random and unconsolidated thoughts I have about it. Legit not coherent points below.

In short, I believe both sides got some severe stereotype of the opposite ""class"". Hate on the advantages of the rich, 

1. I think fast runners should be left to run ahead. Don't slow the fast ones down to match the rest. Push the slower ones up to be closer to the fast ones. You cant expect everybody to have the same ability. Some are fast some are slow. I feel sad for the IP girl getting hate for expressing her opinion on it which is valid. There is no point lumping all the different students in the same class room,  so that all of them get ""equal"" education? Equal and fair is not always the same thing. And you think teaching a class of all differently paced students is that easy? The rich and stable families can afford many additional resources to help them run even faster. So it is 'unfair' to those that don't have access to these resources? Their parents earned that money to spend on their children, its up to them. The focus on how the 'rich' kids get the advantage shouldn't be hated upon. Yes this pushes the 'cleverer' students ahead creating the gap. The rich giving their own children advantage can never be avoided, I believe what we need to access should be split between the ""Basic(by School)"" and ""Additional(by Others)"" 

2. Express don't mix w NA and NT? When you go school, you are in that one same class with that same people like 90% of the time. Even within the class we have in general a few group mah, I not in your group doesn't mean I like you. I'm not interested in interacting with you doesn't mean I look down on you. I walk on the street and I don't make friends w every single person. When I get along with someone is usually because we have a common interest or goal. I dont check your salary before befriending you. After your first day you'll know perhaps 1 or 2 people you think can click one, from there find a few more people that can click, you form a clique in class that you hang out w during recess and after school. And you'll be comfortable within that group, it can be taxing on people to break out of this comfortable circle and just know random people. I don't put in the effort to mix w you don't mean I don't like you, it's just that I don't know you. 

3. Those who do look down on people who cant do academically well, its just them being assholes and obviously not educated enough to see past the grades. And who taught this assholes that they're superior if they 'clever'? You mother, your father, your uncle, your auntie, 

4. For my secondary school, like a neighbourhood kind, we've got a good mix of people, rich and poor, slightly popular for its ah beng-ness. I didn't see the segregation due rich and poor here. The the express student classes got some combined class among themselves, for classes NA, and NT is like completely no overlap one. So no chance to interact during lessons. But when CCA starts all come together all play together all go camp go training etc together nice what. About common interest, we mix damn well when we go Dota together. There's a group of people I would avoid from NA, NT, not based on their academic performance, but they and their temper wanting to show their attitude, want fight all. Even within the NA classes, there's the clear segregation between those who're nice and hardworking, and those that're just to be the little gang boss all. 

4. Then what's with the name ""NORMAL"", usually when something is majority then you use normal right? Well, back in 2015 about 66.2% of pupils who took 2015 PSLE qualify for Express stream in secondary school. Then naming itself feels slightly insulting sia, it's like calling people ""The tall and the taller ones"", everybody gets what you're implying there and just because you use the word it don't mean it.

This idea of class is taught into the children. They learn these behavior from who those close to them. A passing remark or attitude towards a cleaner like ""eeyer"" with a condescending look, children see children do. Over emphasis on academic result, you don't get the A, you are going to sweep the streets. Instilling the idea that cleaner = bad, and getting A = good. From young probably every single bloody parent drill this idea into the kids mind. You don't get good results in school, you will only be doing what lousy jobs earning little and be poor. From the perspective of the kid, they just want to be able to get what they want, and parents also give this idea that you got money you get what you want. This whole chain of toxic ideas in the kids mind develops the overall form of class and social level. And they wonder where the stress for academic result comes from. Even when a child's family isn't like that, when he goes to school and interact w all the other kids that have this idea of class, and level, he'll still learn this. The kids are coded w the idea that academic results are the only avenue they've got, leaving them w severe anxiety when they are unable to perform. 

Look at the poor NA, NT kid, they have the intention to learn and work. Anybody who is earning a living for themselves should be seen w respect. They not leeching and creating trouble, they are contributing citizens. "

Personally, I feel that anywhere with a table, chair, silence (and aircon) can be considered a study area. But it's only the presence of the huge amount of educational materials that can be considered a library. So, I still stand by strongly that books are the priority of libraries. As much as NUS libraries try to increase the amount of study area, hope that you know there's only so much they can do.

FYI the libraries already have certain levels, which are called closed stacks, whereby they keep past journals and books. For these books, only when the students or staffs request then will the librarian go to these close stacks and collect.   "

Let's admit it. Maybe I am not clear in my previous post. I did not try to categorize passion and money to be mutually exclusive. In fact, if you found something that has passion and is accompanied by high salary, I will definitely be happy for you! What i am referring is if you are in a point where you got to choose a route with either passion with low salary or a route with no passion with high salary, my advice to you is to choose the route - ""No passion with high salary"". Better to be upset with cash rather than upset with no cash.  Eh, must think far la...This is Singapore okie! Next time when you grow older and IF you decide to start a family, you need to buy house, buy pamper, buy milk, buy food, give your parents money, child expenditures...etc. All of this need money. How much can your ""high passion with no money"" able to support all of this ??? Even if you decide to stay super frugal, after deducting CPF, how much will your disposable income left? At that point, you will constantly be looking towards payday everyday. Of course, there are few people who choose with ""High passion with low salary"", either you decided to stay single forever or you come from a rich family. I am in my mid 30s and just wants to share my opinions. To those people who thinks that being money-focused is a bad thing, bored or narrow-minded, I agree to you that it is stressful and worrying. But let me tell you...you are saying all these now because you are currently studying and not paying for all the expenses. Who is paying for your electricity bills, water bills, internet bills, home and your food? It is your parents right? You do not even need to worry on ""where to stay"" because it is provided by your hardworking parents who are money-focused to give you a better and easy non-money focused life. If you were to finance for your own stay, market rental rate is approximately $600 already for a hdb room. Total cost of living minimum at $1k. If let's say that you are to survive on your own, will you still think that ""Aiya , money is nothing la... "". Talk is cheap. True?

I can't help but rather find it amuse by someone who can really rant at my post. You are a university student but the way you write and think sound like a kid to me. First, what do i gain from writing? Nothing. Why so upset about it? There are so many important things to do in life. Why will you even need to condemn yourself to rant on someone post. And when you want to debate or to share your views, try not to add insulting words to it. What is the point of adding ""extrinsically motivated ass"" in your views? This statement is so ""try hard"" to insult me. If you can be easily upset over a wall of text, life will be difficult to you in future. Debate and share your views amicably. And don't think too highly on yourselves that ""Singaporeans never fail to disgust me and let me down time and time again"". Who are you to think that Singapore let you down time and time? LOL. Everyone is nobody in this world.  If you really think that you are somebody, comment it below so I will show you my ""extrinsically motivated ass"" to you. Else, Stay humble and be kind to others.

Turned out to be a mild blessing since they were more than willing to let me switch despite my home faculty's IGP being worse. 

Never once in the whole process was I like appalled by such perceptions. Like, I know what I want to achieve, and that's all that matters. Inversely, the main point was that my first major was something I excelled in but it became apparent that it was something I had no interest in as a career.  Which was *probably* OP's point"

55845,"A reply to #55731:
Just to add on, there are other common misconceptions...

A Pharmacy Student once said to me: What skills are you going to offer for your job? You have no technical skills.

A company doesn't just run with technical people. You need people to market the products, to manage various aspects of the business which is not directly related to the technical side.

An Architecture Student once said to me: FASS? You mean the one where you have to write lots of fluff to get A?

This is not true. We had to study and critically understand the content. If you think it is so easy to get A for everything, please come and try."
55844,"End of the year.
I helped the people I cared about last year, no matter the circumstances.
I helped myself this year because I exiled myself and gave up on people.
I remember when I lost control of my emotions last year. 
I remember fighting to control my emotions for the whole of this year.
I lost myself last year because of my emotional and mental wreckage.
I lost myself this year because I found out more about myself.
I found out that I did not know what I wanted last year.
I found out what I really wanted this year.
I told myself that I would learn to work in teams last year.
I told myself that I would work alone this year.
I distanced myself from those closest to me last year to find out more about myself. 
I distanced myself from those closest to me this year because I could not stop blaming myself.
I ignored my feelings years ago and felt the consequences last year when my heart was broken.
I ignored everyone close to me and her this year because I felt that I would never be treated as an equal.
I realized that I needed mental and emotional support from someone who could keep me grounded last year.
I realized this year that this is probably going to stay with me for the rest of my life.
I asked myself last year, how do I move on from that?
I ask myself this year, what's next so that I can get the rest of my life over and done with?
I ask myself this year, will someone ever accept me for the decisions I made before?
I ask myself this year, will I ever be seen as an equal? Will everyone ever accept me for being different?

As much as I find my grades and skills to be superior to most this time, I ask myself, will anyone ever see me for who I can be, am trying to be, and really am, rather than the person who I was before or the person who they think I am?"

55842,"I’m an A levels 90 pointer who entered FASS this year as my first choice to pursue Econs and Psych. I am staying in PGP. PGP is actually quite secure btw, just remember to lock your door, tabao food for dinner and stay for your laundry to finish in the laundry room so that there are no accidents haha xD 

I have met people studying more technical majors who looked down at me after I said I am from FASS. I chose my majors because I am interested in my majors unlike a MINORITY who looked for a major with high employment although he/she has no interest in it

I want to say that not everyone is academically talented. 
Everyone has their own strength which may not be a technical skill like engineering. It can be entrepreneurialship skills or essay writing skills. There won’t be newspapers without writers and reporters, students without teachers and so on.

Every degree is useful, but how to use it is another story. Many of us won’t even be working in the same sector as what we majored in 20 years down the road. Trust me!

Ps. It was quite funny seeing people discriminating me as someone who did worse than them for A Levels and then treat me in a different manner after finding out I’m a ddp from an ‘elite’ jc. Those are the people I would avoide being friends with btw. Advice from a Y3 PGP FASS student."

Hopefully, this'll wake up some of you and get you off your high horses. Times and market demands will shift. But what matters is how you respond to the change. "

55836,"Personally as someone who has graduated with an business degree, I must admit that the choice between choosing arts and a ""practical"" degree is definitely worrying. But having been in the workforce from one of the big companies, there are generally quite some stereotypes and some generalization that are very apparent.

For one, business students are perceived as one of the most selfish and self-centered. Secondly, there are really quite stubborn and insist on financial theories which were taught in their finance classes without being open to new perspectives. All the viewpoints given are really very closed minded and parroting what the textbook would say, without having their own opinion.

On the contrary, my friends who were from arts degree are definitely more critical and provide the company with views that are more directed. Granted, they are well versed with finance theories, but when they form their opinions of the world, it is amazingly interesting and surprisingly accurate. Their views have a much higher accuracy rate than those from business degrees. 

You can enter finance industry (barring fields like audit since you really need an accountancy degree) with any degree - there's no barriers to entry. You only need 10 minutes to understand simple concepts like time value of money and WACC and probably a day to fully appreciate how to read a balance sheet. That's all. The value that business degree sell, based on my experience, is worthless since anyone can really pick up those skills with ease.

Final words, arts student have a more vivid and colorful life, and coupled with their success, you really envy them for not having a dull life at all!

Also, nearly half of my division are from arts degree, and they are doing significantly better than those who were from business. (Surprise? Not really, kind of expected considering the education both sides went through)"
55835,"I think with all the dick measuring about degrees going on, I feel the need to say that insecurities speak the loudest. If you really believe in your degree you won't give a shit what others think. Grow up and take up internships and courses to further your employability and stop with all this trivial nonsense. "
55834,"A friend told me he went into FASS because he could not get anywhere else.

That being said, he is doing horribly in his modules. Truthfully, I am glad that these people (those that think FASS is easy) actually existed because hello bell curve tankers."

55828,"My FYP research assistant is from hell. She literally obstructs any progress of my work, by delaying submission of paper work. Every time I check in with her, she does not bother to give me updates or replies. When I finally meet her in person, she tells me that it is not done yet or she hasn’t submitted them yet.

She will set up meetings to which I have to travel to school early for, and whenever I reach, she tells me that she gave me the wrong date or time, like I have nothing better to do with my time. She is also so robotic and monotonous, that I feel highly uncomfortable in her presence and I feel like I am talking to a wall. 

It is just a matter of a few months and I am no where near done for my fyp because of this unnecessary delays and her nonsense. I’m not even sure why she’s called an assistant because the only thing she is assisting me in, is failing."

55824,"I am the poster for #55796

Let's admit it. Maybe I am not clear in my previous post. I did not try to categorize passion and money to be mutually exclusive. In fact, if you found something that has passion and is accompanied by high salary, I will definitely be happy for you! What i am referring is if you are in a point where you got to choose a route with either passion with low salary or a route with no passion with high salary, my advice to you is to choose the route - ""No passion with high salary"". Better to be upset with cash rather than upset with no cash.  Eh, must think far la...This is Singapore okie! Next time when you grow older and IF you decide to start a family, you need to buy house, buy pamper, buy milk, buy food, give your parents money, child expenditures...etc. All of this need money. How much can your ""high passion with no money"" able to support all of this ??? Even if you decide to stay super frugal, after deducting CPF, how much will your disposable income left? At that point, you will constantly be looking towards payday everyday. Of course, there are few people who choose with ""High passion with low salary"", either you decided to stay single forever or you come from a rich family. I am in my mid 30s and just wants to share my opinions. To those people who thinks that being money-focused is a bad thing, bored or narrow-minded, I agree to you that it is stressful and worrying. But let me tell you...you are saying all these now because you are currently studying and not paying for all the expenses. Who is paying for your electricity bills, water bills, internet bills, home and your food? It is your parents right? You do not even need to worry on ""where to stay"" because it is provided by your hardworking parents who are money-focused to give you a better and easy non-money focused life. If you were to finance for your own stay, market rental rate is approximately $600 already for a hdb room. Total cost of living minimum at $1k. If let's say that you are to survive on your own, will you still think that ""Aiya , money is nothing la... "". Talk is cheap. True?


To #55824

I can't help but rather find it amuse by someone who can really rant at my post. You are a university student but the way you write and think sound like a kid to me. First, what do i gain from writing? Nothing. Why so upset about it? There are so many important things to do in life. Why will you even need to condemn yourself to rant on someone post. And when you want to debate or to share your views, try not to add insulting words to it. What is the point of adding ""extrinsically motivated ass"" in your views? This statement is so ""try hard"" to insult me. If you can be easily upset over a wall of text, life will be difficult to you in future. Debate and share your views amicably. And don't think too highly on yourselves that ""Singaporeans never fail to disgust me and let me down time and time again"". Who are you to think that Singapore let you down time and time? LOL. Everyone is nobody in this world.  If you really think that you are somebody, comment it below so I will show you my ""extrinsically motivated ass"" to you. Else, Stay humble and be kind to others. No one owe you anything to make you feel disgusted in life."
55822,"Recently I purchased an iced coffee from Utown and they did not give me a straw. This is the first time since the straw ban that I bought a cold drink without a straw.

So I thought it was alright to try out the straw ban. Oh boy was I wrong. The iced coffee was filled with ice and every time I tried to drink, the ice will reach my mouth, making it difficult to sip on the coffee only. On top of that, the coldness of the drink hit my front teeth and the tingling sensation of coldness in the front teeth strikes.

Every sip of the coffee brings agony and frustration. The coldness hitting the front teeth. The ice constantly reaching my mouth instead of the coffee. I threw the entire cup away after only drinking a quarter of it. I am totally on the side of environmental conservation, but not at the cost of bringing agony and frustration to myself.

Before you say I could order a hot coffee instead, realize that all these problems and frustration would not have arise with a straw. A paper straw is utterly disgusting and you can literally taste the paper.. I guess the next time when I order an iced coffee again, I will grab a straw from gongcha... "
55818,"#55713 I stayed in PGP for the whole 4 years of my bachelor. Don't worry, it is safe. You have to tap card to enter the lift, tap card to press lift buttons, and then tap card to enter your cluster gate. Three layers of security before you reach your room. Plus cameras everywhere.
I wouldn't say PGP is the cleanest but definitely reasonably clean. Rooms are fully furnished. More quiet as compared to halls, where there are lots of CCAs and activities happening. And it is a bus terminal, which means you will be one of the first to board and will likely get a seat. Busses are extremely crowded esp. at the beginning of the semester and during exam time. Plus, if it is terminal, you don't need to worry about missing the stop."

55809,Which is the most ''practical'' major in fass? I am planning to come to fass next year. Can any seniors enlighten me? 
55805,"Im a comp science major. Most of my peers think we are superior due to the higher barriers to entry to our course compared to other courses like fass, biz and other faculties. I disagree with them and i think all degrees and majors are the same. Its what you do with the paper that matters"
55803,Insights from FASS can never be found anywhere. I am inspired greatly on how much I have learnt from FASS profs esp GEH1075. I can never think the same way again with such knowledge and it will definitely be useful in the future. Appreciate all the work and dedicated profs here in FASS :) Thank you to all passionate profs in FASS. smiley face :)
55800,"For the whole FASS debate, I respect those who have taken an Arts degree for what it offers rather than for the sake of merely getting a NUS degree. (hence the term dumping grounds) These are the people who are truly passionate about what they do, and they need not justify THEIR decision to study FASS. Whatever they do, we have no right to impose our judgement on them whether or not they have made a right/wrong choice.

However, I think those against FASS have a point here especially for those who are considering FASS as a last resort for the sake of a NUS degree. We should be thankful for them to voice out a perspective of a potential reality that they would face while finishing the course and when they graduate. 

However, At the end of the day, all of us have to be true to ourselves and pursue something we are passionate about. (Not just because of other’s views and opinions) A Uni course is not entirely definitive about one’s future but instead it is your own passion, drive, motivation and adaptability that shapes what you do in the future. At my final year in Uni with multiple internship experiences, what I have learnt in University may never translate 100% into what I do in the workplace. Instead, the knowledge I have learnt here exists at the back of my mind that would have definitely helped me in my area of expertise, but only to a certain percentage. The major factor is your drive, your adaptability, and the motivation to learn new things in all workplaces we may be at. There are Engineers in banks, Science majors in the consulting industry and pyschology majors in the data science and analytics industry. So who’s to say what are your limits based on a major you take? YOU are your own enabler, and you are what you make of yourself. Be true to yourselves people. "
